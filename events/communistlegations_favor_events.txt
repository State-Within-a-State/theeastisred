Today reports of uprisings across the countryside suggest that this suppression has comprehensively failed: dozens of villages in the countryside have taken arms against the Government and seek to overthrow their new oppressors.\n\nIt is unclear what these peasants truly want, and attempts to negotiate with them have been unsuccessful. Representatives sent to investigate the situation have not left alive, or in one piece for that matter, but one assumes the immediate reform of agricultural practice and the replacement of the Chairman's cronies are at the top of their agenda.

It falls to our government to dismantle this myth of egalitarianism, and Chairman Zhang has delivered the starting blow. In a speech today, Zhang officially declared other races ‘primitive and undeveloped’ variants of the Han Chinese cultural group. \n\nOf course, citizens are so enthused by the news that spontaneous celebrations have broken out in the major cities under our control. Joyous demonstrations have set several districts of Hui, Mongol and Tibetan tenements on fire, and games of physical violence between Han and non-Han now play out on the streets of Shanghai as minorities are shown their righteous place in society.

Indeed, today the Shanghai Government has proclaimed a glorious victory for the whole of the Chinese nation, for we have eradicated Chinese class distinctions almost entirely! The new focus of our agitation and ideological work now turns to driving the Chinese nation against all the enemies that have historically wronged us - and there are many enemies we must vanquish. \n\n In what we have termed Operation Great Wall of the People, tens of thousands of laborers have been mobilized to celebrate national rejuvenation, with burnings of Western books and effigies taking place alongside great cultural performances of Chinese plays demonstrating our timeless virtues.
