In a cynical reversal of ways , Zhou Enlai has proposed to his comrades a new plan for the future , a red Federation of Communes.  The warlord states will no longer be controlled by the elite , but rather by the people for the people. These Communes will then all be federated into a council of Leaders that act within mutual assistance of each other to defend the Chinese civilisation  from Imperialists.  China will never be divided again , but will never be centralised into the same tyrannical state that leads to the cycle of warlordism."

The Printing press is alive with the buzz of papers with the title “Red Dawn in Shanghai” , and the revolutionary spirit has travelled as far as the Imperial German Quarter of the city  , where the  ambassadors and imperial citizens look on solemnly as the red banner is seen ever closer to their gates.  Comrade Duxui , Liu Shaoqi and other fellow comrades will be preparing a statement to the sound of the International , but sung in chinese. However the foreign powers have yet to show their reactionary faces  , as the future of the Legation Cities will be forever uncertain as the people's revolution claims  Shanghai with Comrade Duxui at the helm of this revolution. The Third International will be meeting in London to discuss this interesting turn of events."

While the Party has not realised much information on his sorrowful passing , although the Party has confirmed that he died of a Gun Shot wound , by an unknown Gun man  during one of his Famous speeches .   However  some loyal Maoists spread theories of a coup or a assisination by the Japanese, leading to unrest amongst the red Guard .  Which may only increase as the question of who will lead the revolution forward and follow  Maos footsteps is yet to be decided.

Comrade Mao's official portrait  will be hung on the wall with a banner reading: "Carry on the cause left by Chairman Mao and carry on the cause of proletarian revolution to the end”. "
