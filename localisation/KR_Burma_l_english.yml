### Events ###
burma.0.t:0 "A War-torn Nation"
burma.0.d:0 "The 1925 British Revolution unavoidably caused the downfall of its once mighty colonial empire. While India proper soon cemented into three separate nation states, the status of Burma was long unclear - with Bharatiya, Siamese, Chinese, Native Burmese and British loyalist forces all operating in the country, the region was a chaotic patchwork of territories resembling near-warlordism. Although the British loyalists (operating mainly from Mandalay and Rangoon) were soon crushed and the Chinese were soon distracted by their own civil war, the Bharatiyas and Siamese kept troops within the country until 1929 - when, fed up with the unstable situation, German mediation brought an end to the hostilities. The resulting treaty awarded parts of eastern and northern Burma to Siam, and left the rest of the country under a restored Konbaung dynasty. In the years since, Queen Myat Pya Lat has struggled to cement her rule against an increasingly radical and politically demanding populace. All the while, Bharatiya waits for an opportunity to spread the revolution east. When the day comes, will Burma be ready?"
