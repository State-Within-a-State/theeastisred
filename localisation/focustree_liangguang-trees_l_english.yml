From this Tang is given a reminder to 1904, where he would be sent to negotiate with the British Empire on the status of Tibet. It was Yuan Shikai instructed Tang Shaoyi never to let Britain colonize Tibet as it had done with India. Fearing a Russian invasion of the small kingdom in the Himalayas, Britain attacked Tibet and tried to take advantage of the impending entry of Japan and Russia into a state of war to expel the Russians from Tibet and exclude China. Tibet appealed to the Qing government for help, which Beijing considered a brutal violation of Chinese sovereignty. Qing government officials claimed that China and Britain had signed four treaties in the 19th century. In each of the treaties, they stated that all issues concerning the entry of British people into Tibet required China's consent. In view of recent developments, it was necessary to remind Britain to abide by the treaty, and the Qing Dynasty sent Tang Shaoyi to India to negotiate with Britain. When Tang Shaoyi met with these British officials, he was disgusted with Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India . Most of the delegation despaired because of Lord Curzon's refusal to make concessions, but Tang Shaoyi did not see it that way. Tang was able to prevent any British action from occurring in Tibet, safeguarding China’s interest in the region. Now looking on from such a time, Tang sets a clear tone to foreign powers that China will not be governed by outsiders."
