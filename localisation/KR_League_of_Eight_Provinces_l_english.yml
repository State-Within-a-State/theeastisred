### Leaders ###
POLITICS_LEP_SUN_CHUANFANG_DESC:0 "Like many of his peers who flaunt a variety of colourful monikers, Marshal Sun Chuanfang is known as 'The Smiling Tiger'. His greatest strength lies in careful cultivation of personal relationships, as he is a master of navigating local webs of influence and intrigue; leveraging everyone from old army friends, to wealthy bankers, to foreign dignitaries. It is this last category in particular that has proven to be his best asset, and his German connections have become indespensible.\nHowever, his nickname also carries sinister undertones. Beneath a mask of smiles he is known to be hard to read, and he has executed former friends and former enemies alike after assurances to the contrary. These qualities have left Sun sitting at the head of a vast bureaucratic pyramid, and one of the most powerful men in China."
POLITICS_LEP_QI_XIEYUAN_DESC:0 "Political Career:§L\nAt the academy Qi earned a reputation for short height, masterful calligraphy, and cunning. As a soldier only one of these served him well, but it nontheless catapulted him to prominence in Eastern China, his rise only cut short by a combination of invasion and allied betrayal in late 1924.\nFor the next several years Qi remained in exile, plotting his return, and in the aftermath of the Shanghai Conference he secured German sponsorship, giving him leave to set up shop in the city of Wuxi. Sun Chuanfang tolerated his presence, perhaps feeling that enemies were best kept close; a feeling he may have since come to regret."

POLITICS_LEP_SUN_CHUANFANG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 17th, 1885\nTaian, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLike many of his peers who flaunt a variety of colourful monikers, Marshal Sun Chuanfang is known as 'The Smiling Tiger'.

Sun Chuanfang tolerated his presence, perhaps feeling that enemies were best kept close; a feeling he may have since come to regret."
POLITICS_AOG_ALEXANDER_VON_FALKENHAUSEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 29th, 1878\nGut Blumenthal, Silesia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nSince fighting as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, Alexander von Falkenhausen has possessed a keenly cultivated interest in oriental affairs. With his thorough grasp of both the Japanese language and the Asian political situation, his former service as a Military Attaché in Tokyo made him a prime candidate to lead the military intervention against the Northern Expedition in 1926. A year later he went on to assist Wu Peifu against the Fengtian Clique in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War, after which he became the primary military consultant for Sun Chuanfang's administration in Nanjing. Currently, not only has he been helping Sun's Army to eliminate NRA remnants in Fujian, but he has also worked to ready China for a future war with Japan, making use of his ample experience and keen strategic mind."
POLITICS_LEP_CHEN_YI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 3rd, 1883\nShaoxing, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLike many among his generation of officers, Chen Yi graduated from the Rikugun Shikan Gakko military academy in Japan. More unusually he has also served as the chairman of a bank. Chen joined Sun Chuanfang's Southern Zhili faction in 1924, and rose to prominence through his brutal suppression of Chinese Syndicalists in the Shanghai Uprising of 1932. As a reward for his unquestioning service he was appointed governor of Zhejiang Province, replacing Lu Xiangting.\nUnder his regime, Zhejiang might be considered the geographic and economic inverse of Jiangsu, with a small but wealthy north and desperately poor southern regions. Though Chen himself is not particularly susceptible to bribes, he routinely ignores his subordinate’s abuses in order to quench dissent, and only a few regiments of soldiers could be considered truly loyal to his person despite his reputation as a harsh disciplinarian."
POLITICS_LEP_ZHENG_JUNYAN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YMilitary Career:§L\n As governor of Jiangsu, Zheng Junyuan has built his stronghold in the city of Xuzhou, located at one of China's most crucial railway junctures, and far from Sun Chuanfang’s seat of power in Nanjing. As a result of his positioning, he has managed to secure a fair amount of autonomy by playing Sun, Wu Peifu, and the Germans off of each other for safe and reliable access to the railroad. He also maintains a rivalry with Zhang Zongchang over control of the north-south line and is known to have sent a number of notices to Nanjing concerning a troubling spread of the Yiguandao faith. Under Zheng's rule Jiangsu is known as a province of contrasts, its poorest regions bordered by Shandong to the north, and some of China's wealthiest districts in its south along the banks of the Yangtze."
POLITICS_LEP_DENG_RUZUO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1888\nFuyang, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nUnder Deng's regime, Jiangxi shares a number of traits with Anhui to its north, chief among them a predominantly poor and rural population. Much of the province has never truly recovered from the widespread destruction of the Taiping rebellion, and even after seventy years the ruins of abandoned cities can sometimes be glimpsed amid the mountains. Unlike Anhui Jiangxi has not quite escaped German attention. With virtually nonexistent infrastructure and few direct paths to the coast, the city of Nanchang and its surrounds are the planned terminus of the new Zhegan Railway, linking the city to Shanghai, opening up significant new markets and resources in the Chinese interior. Of particular interest to the Germans is the city of Jingdezhen, the porcelain from which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin, along with other less-legitimate pursuits such as the stolen antiquities trade. So far, the new railway has been built primarily with German financing, though there are rumors that the Germans mean to purchase the railway in its entirety; rumors likely lending strength to the KMT’s supporters hiding in in the province’s south."
POLITICS_LEP_ZHOU_YINREN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nWuqiang, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA long-standing subordinate to and former classmate of Sun Chuanfang, Zhou Yinren and the League-Marshal share a personal bond. Perhaps this is why Zhou was trusted with governorship of Fujian, the most mountainous and impoverished of the Eight Provinces. A narrow band of coastline constitutes the majority of the area under direct rule, and every port of Fujian shows a heavy German presence. Though generous aid from Nanjing has helped Zhou establish a greater degree of control over the province than he and his predecessors had last decade, much of it remains in a state of near-anarchy, and parts have fallen to an agrarian-socialist remnant of the KMT. These rebels, occasionally raiding the coastal settlements, have so far resisted two punitive expeditions aiming to dislodge them."
POLITICS_LEP_SHANGGUAN_YUNXIANG_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1895\nJinan, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAlthough born into a moderately wealthy family, Shangguan Yunxiang spent his youth amid austerity as funds were split between his numerous siblings. After graduating from Baoding in 1919 he was sent to join Sun Chuanfang's Hubei Army, and by 1923 followed Sun into Fujian. Shangguan soon established a reputation for himself as a highly capable general.\nHis greatest achievement was the defeat of the NRA's 4th Army, which previously defeated Wu Peifu's army at Tingsi Bridge. Even today Sun Chuanfang considers this proof of his coalition's inherent superiority to Wu Peifu’s directly controlled divisions."
POLITICS_LEP_ZHOU_FENGQI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1879\nChangxing, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhou Fengqi began his career as a late-Qing confucian scholar, but turned against the ruling dynasty when he joined the anti-Qing Guangfuhui through Qiu Jin's introduction. He has consistently opposed central government overreach and supported the "Zhejiang Ruled by Zhejiang People" and "Independence of Ningbo" campaigns. After helping Sun Chuanfang take over Zhejiang, he secured a promotion to garrison commander of Nanjing.\nHe can be considered a loyalist of Sun Chuanfang's Nanjing faction, and joined the suppression of Syndicalists during the 1932 Shanghai Uprising."
POLITICS_LEP_TANG_ENBO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 20th, 1900\nJinhua, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTang Enbo was sent to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy by Chen Yi in order to become a staff officer, and the two can be considered sponsor and protégé. At the Academy Tang focused intensely on infantry doctrine, and his resultant competence has earned him Sun Chuanfang's respect.\nNotably Tang prefers to direct his forces with the use of modern communications equipment instead of from the front."
POLITICS_LEP_SHI_YOUSAN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1891\nJiutai, Jilin, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nShi Yousan started his military career in 1908 under Wu Peifu’s command, but in the tumult following the Xinhai Revolution he was left wandering Beijing. In 1912 he joined Feng Yuxiang’s army and became a trusted subordinate. Not long after he deserted, persuaded to do so by Yan Xishan. He went on to serve in the National Revolutionary Army, but deserted there too amid the failure of the Northern Expedition. Subsequently he participated in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War, this time as a member of Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun, but again Feng's trust was misplaced. As soon as the Zhili Clique's victory became apparent he deserted as usual, and returned to Wu Peifu’s forces again. However by this point his trend of disloyalty had become hard to ignore. Wu Peifu directed him to serve under Sun Chuanfang instead. Within the LEP, Shi Yousan has come to appreciate the personal benefits of working with German sponsorship, but who knows when he might desert again..."
POLITICS_LEP_LI_SHENGCHUN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLi Shengchun is the Deputy Commander of Fujian Province, serving under the command of Zhou Yinren, the military governor of Fujian. Under Zhou, he fought the NRA's 17th Army led by He Yinqing during the Northern Expedition.\nHowever, Li's relationship with his superior is poor. He has frequently disobeyed orders, and repeated failures to purge Kuomintang forces from the JiangFu Insurgent Zone have called his competence into question."

LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy:0 "Conspicuous Kleptocracy"
LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy_desc:0 "Late last decade, Sun Chuanfang opened vast swaths of Eastern and Southern China to exclusive German economic exploitation. Soldiers and officials at almost every level, many already predisposed to corruption, have become complicit in everything from arms smuggling to the stolen antiquities trade. This reflects poorly on the League as a whole."

LEP_Provincial_Armies:0 "Provincial Armies"
LEP_Provincial_Armies_desc:0 "The League is large, but its sizable army is in fact a collection of semi-autonomous provincial forces united by their leaders’ personal loyalties to Marshal Sun. This eases recruitment, but presents serious logistical and organizational handicaps."

LEP_Nanking_Kommission:0 "The Nanking-Kommission"
LEP_Nanking_Kommission_desc:0 "The Nanking-Kommission, advising the League’s leadership on behalf of Berlin, includes an officer-corps intended to reorganize Chinese divisions along German lines. So far they have seen some success in equipping and training the Marshal’s personal divisions, as well as imparting the Weltkrieg’s lessons to their officers."
LEP_Nanking_Kommission1:0 "The Nanking-Kommission"

LEP_Yangtze_Special_Taxes:0 "Yangtze Special Taxes"
LEP_Yangtze_Special_Taxes_desc:0 "The meandering Yangtze River runs through the country’s heart, bringing coastal commerce inland, and inland produce to the world market. Paired with China’s largest industrial base toward the river’s mouth, the Yangtze is a veritable river of gold, and the cities along its banks are common targets for extensive taxation."

LEP_Low_Level_Unrest:0 "Sporadic Unrest"
LEP_Low_Level_Unrest_desc:0 "The recently announced consolidation of the Central China Railway has triggered a series of street protests and other popular demonstrations across the League. Though there is talk of boycotts, unrest is nothing new, and is expected to fizzle out within a few weeks."

LEP_Spreading_Unrest:0 "Spreading Unrest"
LEP_Spreading_Unrest_Desc:0 "Instead of dying down, unrest has continued to spread, taking root in almost every major city across the League. So far, this still remains nothing unprecedented, and the government response will almost certainly be as it always has been; violent and resolute."

LEP_Anti-Concessions_Movement:0 "The Anti-Concessions Movement"
LEP_Anti-Concessions_Movement_desc:0 "The events surrounding the creation of the Central China Railway have led to a violent outburst of patriotic agitation, directed against governmental figures and foreigners alike, the sort of which hasn’t been seen since the May Fourth Movement over a decade ago. This naturally plays into the hands of the Nanjing Clique’s enemies."

lep_idea_rampantdisorder:0 "The rise of the Anti-Concessions Movement and the death of Sun Chuanfang has led to a new period of “Hunzhan” - confused or chaotic fighting, as general turns against general, soldier against soldier. The markets have collapsed, the police are overwhelmed, and chaos spreads in the streets, as seemingly the whole of society turns against itself. A great deal of blood may be spilled before any semblance of peace returns to Eastern China."

### Focuses ###

LEP_qi_rules_nanjing:0 "Qi Rules Nanjing"
LEP_qi_rules_nanjing_desc:0 "Qi Xieyuan, a well respected general and controller of many of the troops around Nanjing, has seized control of the city. This makes him Sun's nominal successor. Qi now rules the Nanjing Clique. However, chaos reigns in what was previously the LEP and it is not certain that all the former LEP governors recognize Qi."
LEP_north_south_west:0 "North, South or West"
LEP_north_south_west_desc:0 "The Nanjing Clique has enemies in the north, the south and the west. Our territory is divided, with the Anqing Clique close to our heart. We must choose which enemies we will focus on first. We also need to reestablish contact with the former governors of the LEP provinces, in order to ensure their loyalties."
LEP_jiangnan_loans:0 "Jiangnan Loans"
LEP_jiangnan_loans_desc:0 "The AOG has been hit hard by Black Monday and has been unable to pay the rent on many of their concessions to us. This is unacceptable, but right now there is nothing we can do as we depend on their support. The Jiangnan Consortium has been somewhat isolated from the crisis and have offered us loans, which we should take in order to finance our armies and government."
LEP_aog_gun_shipments:0 "AOG Gun Shipments"
LEP_aog_gun_shipments_desc:0 "While the AOG does not yet have its finances under control, it has begun to stabilize somewhat. They have large amounts of guns available and we must make sure that these are sent to us, as we are dealing with serious gun shortages. Furthermore, our own production capacities are limited, making their support even more valuable."
LEP_consolidate_the_heartland:0 "Consolidate the Heartland"
LEP_consolidate_the_heartland_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to stabilize our situation, it is paramount we make a large effort to consolidate our heartland around Nanjing and the surrounding provinces. This will make sure we have a strong core area from which we can strike. However, if we make this effort before dealing with some other problems, it might not be as effective. We must find the right time in order to focus on consolidation."
LEP_qis_central_command:0 "Qi's Central Command"
LEP_qis_central_command_desc:0 "The disorganized, decentralized nature of the current governor armies on which we rely is not sufficient for the current conflict. We need to make an effort to establish a unified central command. The governors will retain their authority, but important decisions will now be made in coordination instead of separation."
LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty:0 "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "Our officers are all of dubious loyalty. We have a core force that has followed Qi for years, but now that we control much of Sun's former forces as well as the forces of the governor's forces, we cannot be so sure. The KMT and Shanqing also continue to secretly recruit, so we must make sure our officers are loyal to the cause of the Nanjing Clique, and no other."
LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation:0 "Emergency Industry Reallocation"
LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation_desc:0 "Much of our limited industry is in disarray. We need to coordinate the industry we have available to focus on military production. As we do not have the resources for this ourselves, we must rely on the Jiangnan Consortium and AOG to help us with this effort. We will leave some assets under their management to ensure that our own incompetent officers will not cause problems."
LEP_price_controls:0 "Price Controls"
LEP_price_controls_desc:0 "With the collapse of the LEP, our money notes have become nearly worthless and inflation is rising at a breakneck pace. While price controls are not an ideal solution, we must make sure there is at least a temporary stop to the devaluations in order to properly pay our soldiers. It will hopefully also calm the countryside and put a halt to rising food prices, at least for the time being."
LEP_suppress_student_unions:0 "Suppress Student Associations"
LEP_suppress_student_unions_desc:0 "The so-called 'patriotic' student associations have been a thorn in our side for a while now. They were the key force behind the anti-concessionist protests and continue to make trouble in the cities. If we shut down their means of organisation, we will hopefully suppress the movement as a whole."
LEP_enforce_media_controls:0 "Enforce Media Controls"
LEP_enforce_media_controls_desc:0 "The media are complicit in the collapse of the League and they continue to publish negative reports about our administration and continue to slander Qi's name. We must seize control of much of the media in order to put an end to the spread of dangerous information that could compromise our goals."
LEP_government_by_coercion:0 "Government by Coercion"
LEP_government_by_coercion_desc:0 "We now rule the League and we must, at all costs, prevent its renewed collapse. We will not make the same mistakes Sun Chuanfang made. Instead, we will build a strong government, based not on weakness, but on strength. We will not shy away from harsh methods in order guarantee its survival."
LEP_finish_sun_investigation:0 "Finish the Sun Investigation"
LEP_finish_sun_investigation_desc:0 "We have waited long enough with presenting the results of our investigation into the assassination of the former leader of the League, Sun Chuanfang. It is time to finish up the work and release the results to the public. Hopefully we can spin these results in such a way to strengthen our position."
LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists:0 "Purge the Complicit"
LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists_desc:0 "Currently there are still many people in our government of which we cannot be sure that they will support us. Using our release of the results of the Sun assassination investigation, as well as by painting our enemies as complicit in the collapse, we should be able to make many arrests and purge our ranks of their presence."
LEP_university_oversight_board:0 "University Oversight Board"
LEP_university_oversight_board_desc:0 "We have seen how dangerous students can become if they organize. They were key players in the Anti-Concessionist Movement and will continue to be dangerous if we do not properly keep an eye on them. Therefore we must establish the University Oversight Board, which will make sure that any 'dangerous' individuals within universities are neutralized."
lep_governor_1:0 "Now that we again control Zhejiang and Anhui, the governors of which both traitorously rose up against us, we must decide who to replace them with. We must make sure that they are our close allies and will not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. Furthermore, we should also finish formalizing relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."
lep_governor_2:0 "After the traitorous uprising of the Governor of Anhui, Chen Tiaoyuan, we now once again control his province. We must decide who replaces Chen as Governor of Anhui and make sure that our replacement does not repeat Chen's mistake. Furthermore, we should also finish formalizing relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."

LEP_track_down_kmt:0 "Eradicate KMT Cells"
LEP_track_down_kmt_desc:0 "While we might have driven KMT military units out of Fujian, partisans continue to operate within our territory. We also fear that some KMT members may have infiltrated our ranks. We must track down the remaining Kuomintang bases and eliminate the various active KMT cells."
LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects:0 "Crack Down on Yiguandao Sects"
LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects_desc:0 "Yiguandao adherents continue to terrorize our citizens. While we might have warded off Shanqing, many followers still stir up trouble. We must begin a large crackdown on various Yiguandao sects in order to cripple their movement."
LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system:0 "Reconstitute Baojia System"
LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system_desc:0 "The baojia system envisioned local control of local militias. It aimed to increase stability and assign local responsibility. While the system failed in the past, it can now be very useful as it allows us to effectively patrol the countryside and allows us to circumvent the governors."
LEP_xiangyong_inspections:0 "Xiangyong Inspections"
LEP_xiangyong_inspections_desc:0 "If we want the baojia system to become a success, we must ensure that the xiangyong, the local baojia units, behave nicely. Inspections will also allow us another method of control over these local militias without having to worry about the governors."
LEP_water_infrastructure_commission:0 "Water Infrastructure Commission"
LEP_water_infrastructure_commission_desc:0 "The war has damaged an enormous amount of critical infrastructure designed to protect our cities from the rivers. Dams, dikes, levees have all been damaged. We need to set up a special commission with adequate funding to repair these immediately. If we wait, floods can potentially endanger millions of Chinese."
LEP_peace_in_countryside:0 "Peace in the Countryside"
LEP_peace_in_countryside_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the most seditious elements that started the war, we can begin the last efforts to fully restore peace to the countryside. For months now, people were afraid to go out and travel, as roads were infested with bandits and rebels. But with our measures and reforms, we have increased security and peace has returned to the countryside."
LEP_selective_enforcement:0 "Selective Enforcement"
LEP_selective_enforcement_desc:0 "It is not through the law that will achieve legitimacy as a government. We can only achieve this through achieving a stable government that is not questioned. Therefore, we can afford to selectively apply the law as we see fit. By allowing certain companies and individuals extralegal rights, we can be sure of their support, as we will crack down hard on their enemies."
LEP_reform_public_security:0 "Reform Public Security"
LEP_reform_public_security_desc:0 "One of the problems Sun Chuanfang faced, was that he had no dependable network of agents that maintained security in his name. With Qi's Nanjing Guards, this will now change. With these reforms, Qi will have agents everywhere, which will allow him to react quicker and keep the peace."
LEP_redoubts_for_revenue:0 "Redoubts for Revenue"
LEP_redoubts_for_revenue_desc:0 "With the recent war still fresh in the minds of our governors, combined with the general instability beyond the borders, means that our governors will be very much occupied with security. We will offer them help in constructing fortifications and other defenses, in exchange for them allowing Nanjing to raise additional taxes from their territory."
LEP_tackle_local_corruption:0 "Tackle Local Corruption"
LEP_tackle_local_corruption_desc:0 "Local corruption is a serious issue. It harms our ability to extract taxes from the local level of government, it takes an unnecessary toll on the local farmers and it fills the pockets of those who do not need it. For this reason, we should begin dealing with this issue. The inspectors we will use for this will also allow us greater control over local governments."
LEP_green_gang_dealings:0 "Green Gang Dealings"
LEP_green_gang_dealings_desc:0 "We must solicit the help of the Green Gang in Shanghai. These crime lords, major players in the drug trade, will allow us to exert influence on potential investors in the Legation Cities. Using the Green Gang, we will surely be able to expand our influence within the Legations."
LEP_public_media_campaigns:0 "Public Media Campaigns"
LEP_public_media_campaigns_desc:0 "Our government is viewed negatively by many. We are seen as the ones who sold out to the Germans and cracked down on the patriots who aimed to kick them out. We must ensure that this image disappears by using our control of the press to spread positive messages about our government, while spreading negative messages about our critics."
LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates:0 "Appoint Civilian Magistrates"
LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates_desc:0 "Many of the provinces and local governments are headed by military men, who depend on their armies for their political power. It is difficult to force them to do anything without fighting. Therefore, we should begin appointing civilian magistrates to positions in local governments and slowly allow them more power, as we can control them more effectively than military men."

LEP_public_repression_desc:0 "We do not deceive ourselves by saying we are a friendly and free government.

LEP_shut_down_intellectual_circles_desc:0 "Various groups and circles of highly-respected intellectuals, many of whom supported the Anti-Concessions Movement that lead to the downfall of Sun Chuanfang, continue to speak out against us.

LEP_crush_urban_unions:0 "Crush Urban Unions"
LEP_crush_urban_unions_desc:0 "Just like the student associations, unions of urban workers have always caused problems.

LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi:0 "Pacification Commmissioner Qi"
LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi_desc:0 "It is customary to give yourself many different positions and titles to create authority in new areas.

LEP_eastern_railway_construction_desc:0 "Railways are the lifeblood of China. Without them, industrial transportation comes to a standstill.

LEP_heavy_industrial_investments_desc:0 "Currently, China's industry is mostly for its own consumption.

LEP_subsidize_local_communities_desc:0 "We have lost support of much of the urban population. Eventually, if our economy develops enough, they will come around. But until that moment, we need the support of another portion of the population, the peasants. For this reason, we must introduce new subsidies for local communities, which will be specifically aimed at rural development. This should help secure their support."

LEP_revitalize_the_tea_trade_desc:0 "The tea trade used to be much more common in southern and eastern China. Furthermore, many of the Chinese peasants lack any kind of monetary income.

LEP_patronize_xiangshen:0 "Patronize the Xiangshen"
LEP_patronize_xiangshen_desc:0 "The xiangshen, the local landowners, are incredibly valuable allies. If we can secure their support, we can also secure the support of the peasants.

LEP_dubious_practices_desc:0 "If Qi wishes to remain in power, he must use any method as his disposal. While Sun Chuanfang often claimed a moral high ground, in reality most of his actions were guided by securing his leadership. Qi should do the same.

LEP_tsingtau_collaboration:0 "Tsingtau Collaboration"

LEP_krupp_industrial_methods_desc:0 "If China wishes to modernize, it needs to adopt the methods of those were successful. Krupp is one of the more powerful German conglomerates, active in both the Legations and the AOG. We should invite them to educate our engineers and entrepreneurs of how to develop new industry.

LEP_westernized_school_curriculum:0 "Westernized School Curriculum"
LEP_westernized_school_curriculum_desc:0 "Chinese education is backward and outdated. Not only our universities are antiquated, our school system in the smaller cities and towns is as well. Children are educated using useless facts and are in no way prepared for the real world.

LEP_schantung_eisenbahn_expansion_desc:0 "The Schantung-Eisenbahn railway company has made plans for extensive railway renovations and expansions around our heartland. We should allow them to make their plans a reality. They will be an effective vehicle for railway development in the north, as having the AOG fund and control these railways directly would most likely not be well-received."
LEP_eastern_resources_commission:0 "Eastern Resources Commission"
LEP_eastern_resources_commission_desc:0 "China holds many resources. Too many, in fact, to just develop randomly. We should establish a joint Sino-German Eastern Resources Commission which will oversee the search and development for additional resources.

LEP_tolerate_vice:0 "Tolerate Vice"
LEP_tolerate_vice_desc:0 "Gambling, prostitution and opium are all morally reprehensible. However, they are also extremely valuable sources of income. While we do not wish to indulge in it ourselves, these vices are too valuable to prohibit entirely.

By concentrating the foreign presence in such a way, we can more easily protect them as well."
LEP_special_road_taxes:0 "Special Transit Taxes"
LEP_special_road_taxes_desc:0 "Implementing special transit taxes would allow us to raise additional revenue for our central government.

lep.1.t:0 "The Imperial Cornerstone"
lep.1.d:0 "Forged amid last decade's wars, and expanded to its current size following the defeat of the Northern Expedition, Sun Chuanfang's League is a loose confederation of provincial governments oriented around his stronghold in Nanjing. Though united by its members' fear of central government control, the League is nonetheless a cornerstone of the Empire, buttressing Beijing against both external threats and internal challengers by virtue of shared heritage.\n\nThis tenuous arrangement has brought years of peace, and with them relative prosperity. Foreign industrial methods have proven transformational, and Sun’s armies now include several German-trained and equipped divisions at their core. The League-Marshal has come to sit atop a vast bureaucratic pyramid, a position he is more than happy to keep, despite the cracks that have begun to appear at its base. German material aid, necessary to offset pressure from Beijing and the League's fractious southern members, has not served as a source of strength alone. German money trickles into every level of the League’s hierarchy, feeding an already ingrained and unhealthy taste for corruption, with officials complicit in everything from embezzlement to the stolen antiquities trade.\n\nThis has gradually stoked the fires of popular discontent, increasingly harnessed by nationalistic agitators, and fueled by the elusive remnants of the Kuomintang. For all Sun’s efforts to draw the fragmented League together, it may be drifting all the further apart. Still, these domestic squabbles are outshone by the rising sun, which looms large in the east. Beset by internal conflicts, the League must rise to this challenge, or else risk annihilation.\n\nBriefings are available on the League's special mechanics, its relationship with the Germans, and internal politics."

lep.2.t:0 "The Central Government"
lep.2.d:0 "Together with his old mentor Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang stopped the Kuomintang’s Northern Expedition in its tracks, and reversed the Fengtian advance onto the Northern Plain. Together they came to control all of China proper, but the peace that followed soon brought a new dilemma. Would Sun continue to bow to his old master in the North, and could Wu permit his old protege to disregard his authority?\n\nThe years since have seen both Wu's Beijing Government and Sun's League hold to an awkward status-quo, guaranteed by their shared enemies to the north and east; the Fengtian Government and Japan. Sun is free to do as he likes within the League, so long as he holds to ceremony and maintains the appearance of a unified country. Whether this can last remains to be seen."

lep.3.t:0 "The Germans"
lep.3.d:0 "Germany's significant role in the 1927 destruction of the Northern Expedition left Berlin with a great deal of leverage in China, tempered only slightly by the 1928 international Shanghai Conference, which claimed to give all nations equal access to the Chinese market. In order to ensure a favorable position in spite of these 'restrictions', German officials proposed a series of agreements with League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang and our constituent governors. By sidestepping both international agreements and Beijing's authority, German strength helps hold together the League and maintain autonomy from Wu Peifu's Northern Zhili, in exchange for an ever increasing spread of German influence.\n\nThis arrangement has gradually lost its luster. As German control grows and the people watch the fruits of their labor line the pockets of generals and foreigners alike, many have come to question its necessity.\n\nThe nature of the League's relationship with Germany may need to be reconsidered going forward."

lep.4.t:0 "Internal Vigilance"
lep.4.d:0 "German influence and the somewhat decentralized nature of the League has often lead to localized unrest, and though this is often quickly dealt with, it can be seen as indicative of a greater malaise. The League is pestered by numerous subversive forces, and though they may be seen as no threat, they must not be allowed to escape control.\n\nA number of Kuomintang holdouts, remnants of the failed Northern Expedition of 1926 and a second smaller uprising in 1932, remain just outside our reach in the mountains of Fujian and the major coastal concessions. Yiguandao adherents, committed to expunging foreign influence and returning China to its long-held traditions, have been moving south from Shandong and making inroads among the eastern provinces. To the south Guangdong and Guangxi, together referred to as Liangguang, as well as Hunan, operate de-facto autonomously and may even harbor ambitions of formal independence.\n\nAll will have to be watched closely."

lep.5.t:0 "The Sun Investigation"
lep.5.d:0 "Following the assassination of Marshal Sun Chuanfang, chaos has continued to plague the League. Thousands have already died, and many more deaths will follow. Although there were many factors that lead to this, the shooting of Sun was the nail in the coffin for the League of 8 Provinces. \n\nWith enemies on all sides, Qi has decided to start an investigation into his murder. Most do not believe this assassin was working alone, and people want answers. Some have suggested she was a Kuomintang agent, others believe she was part of the Yiguandao. Some think she was an agent of Chen, others argue she simply wanted revenge. Some even suggest that it was Qi himself who ordered the killing! An investigation must be started to find the answer. \n\nWith this investigation, there must of course be an investigator. Someone who will lead the case and will find the truth, or at least, whatever Qi needs the truth to be. There are four options for lead investigator. We could choose a man who was close and loyal to Sun, who will know him best and know where to look. However, he may not show Qi in the best light, as many loyal to Sun believe Qi was willing to push Sun aside a little too enthusiastically, and have suspicions of him. Another option is to choose someone loyal to Qi, whom will make sure the results will not harm out administration, but some will not trust the results. Another option is to call in a German investigator, which will have far more credibility than one of ours. The final option is to choose someone from the Northern Zhili Clique, for they won’t have many conflicting loyalties."

lep.6.t:0 "A Sense of Direction"
lep.6.d:0 "Although the investigation into Sun’s death is independent from our government, it may be best to give the investigator our initial speculations and opinions on what occurred that day. This will assist the investigation, and allow us to keep some sort of control over the findings of it. However, the investigator may simply ignore our initial direction, but it may at least sway them slightly."

lep.7.a:0 "Interesting..."

lep.8.t:0 "The Yiguandao are guilty"
lep.8.d:0 "The investigators have concluded that the Yiguandao are guilty of the assassination of Sun Chuanfang. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a devout member of the Yiguandao, who had lived in Shandong just a few years ago. She met with Zhang Tianran personally, whom sent her to Nanjing to act as a spy. As the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway and unrest increased, Zhang Tianran saw it as the perfect opportunity to end Sun and collapse the league."
lep.8.a:0 "Interesting..."

lep.9.t:0 "The Kuomintang are guilty"
lep.9.d:0 "The investigators have concluded that the Kuomintang are guilty of the assassination of Sun Chuanfang. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was an avid member of the Kuomintang, who had worked in the undergrounds of Nanjing for years. She was in contact with Wang Jingwei, whom commanded her to act out the assassination after seeing the unrest caused after the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway."
lep.9.a:0 "Interesting..."

lep.10.t:0 "Sun's associate is guilty"
lep.10.d:0 "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by one of his close associates. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for a friend of his, and had been working for him for years. Although he did not show it himself, Sun's friend was power hungry, and saw Sun as an obstacle that needed to be removed for him to move forward. Though the report does give a few suggestions as to who this man might be, including Chen Yi or Tang Enbo, it says it does not have enough evidence to make any conclusions of his exact identity."
lep.10.a:0 "Interesting..."

lep.11.t:0 "Chen is guilty"
lep.11.d:0 "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by Chen Tiaoyuan. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for Chen, and had been working for him for years. Chen had always been power hungry, and wished to see the downfall of the League. When the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway, and unrest ensued, Chen saw it as his time to make his move, and roll the dice."
lep.11.a:0 "Interesting..."

lep.12.t:0 "The woman wanted revenge"
lep.12.d:0 "The investigators have concluded that the woman who assassinated Sun Chuanfang was doing it out of revenge. According to the report, no real political connections were found with the woman, however, multiple people in her family were killed in wars led by Sun. The report concludes that the woman was thus acting for revenge for her family."
lep.12.a:0 "Interesting..."

lep.13.t:0 "The Germans are guilty!"
lep.13.d:0 "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by the Germans! According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was working for the Germans in Nanjing as a political spy. The report then goes into what can only be described as a conspiracy theory, claiming Germany made the AOG purchase the Zhegan Railway to sow dissent, then commanded the lady to kill Sun. Apparently, the Germans feared that Sun was drifting away from the idea of using German concessions, and wanted someone more favourable to their interests.\n\nIf we released the report like this, it would alienate our German allies in the AOG."
lep.13.a:0 "What..."

lep.14.t:0 "Qi is guilty!"
lep.14.d:0 "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by Qi Xieyuan! According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for Qi, and had been working for him for years. It claims that the great Qi was always power hungry, and always wanted the League-Marshal role for himself. After the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railways, apparently Qi saw his opportunity and had Sun killed, so he could take the leadership.\n\nObviously, this report is full of lies, and the investigators will likely never see the outside of a cell ever again. We cannot release the report like this."
lep.14.a:0 "Lies!"

lep.15.t:0 "Time to release the results"
lep.15.d:0 "Finally, it is time to officially complete the Sun Investigation and release the results. However, with the report in our hands, it may be best if the results were changed a little more to our liking. We must make sure we control the narrative around Sun's death."
lep.15.a:0 "We must stand by the results."

Following the death of Sun, and the 'coup' of Qi, Nanjing's forces were split between Sun loyalists and Qi loyalists. Many of these troops and their commanding officers still believe Qi is not fit to rule, with some even suggesting that Qi had Sun killed so he could take the role of League-Marshal for himself. Since Qi took power, fighting in Nanjing has been widespread, with Sun loyalists mainly being based around the arsenal in Nanjing. The arsenal is a very important military and logistical structure, allowing Sun's forces to hold it for days. However, with it finally now in our hands, our control in Nanjing is all but assured."

Many even feel that perhaps the Kuomintang might be a better option than Qi! Thankfully, with the arsenal in our hands, our troops had the weapons to easily disperse the crowds of protesters.

How is our military supposed to function when the officers serving do not hold absolute loyalty to Qi Xieyuan and Nanjing? To solve this, over the last few days, a massive purge has occurred across our whole officer staff. A committee titled the Military Loyalty Committee was formed, filled with investigators who review all of our officers histories and past ties, and questioned many who were in Nanjing. The Military Loyalty Committee ordered the arrest of many officers, who were found to have links to the Kuomintang, Yiguandao, or some military warlord.

There, in the mountains a few miles from Longyan, scouts found the massive Kuomintang base. After surrounding the compound, Li moved in all units, and were faced with little resistance. After arresting and interrogating multiple KMT members at the base, it became clear that all the soldiers and military leaders had already escaped, apparently planning on going into hiding again in the North of Vietnam. After all the KMT members were arrested or killed, any documents inside were seized and the base was burned to the ground. With this main headquarters of the Kuomintang now in ashes, the Kuomintang itself has been pushed back years in organisation."

Therefore, military police have been sent into all the major Yiguandao monasteries, who have arrested the heads of these monasteries.

Talks went on for hours, in a quiet hall in a small street in Wuxi. Only minimal guards were present, and most high level officials didn't even know of the meeting. At the end of the talks, the result is a plan they unofficially titled \"The Du Nanjing Scheme\". Trhough this plan, Du will use his high level and shady business connections to funnel more capital through Nanjing, and will help keep Qi supplied with weapons through backroom dealings. To pay for this, Nanjing will pay Du directly, with the agreement that 40% of this money will be used in pushing pro-Chinese business in the Legation Cities. Hands were shaken, witnesses were dealt with, and payments were made."

However, with the recent agreements made between Du Yuesheng and Qi Xieyuan, the Green Gang has began to develop in Nanjing. Though the Nanjing police would normally step in to try to curb illegal gang growth, it seems the Nanjing police commissioner has stopped this from occuring, stating the polce should focus on beating \"enemies of the state\". Many assume that he was payed off by the Green Gang. However, the truth of the matter is that the Green Gang themselves never bribed the police commissioner.

Later on that day, another 2 bodies were found dumped on the street in the slums of Nanjing. These other deaths have been identified as more high level anti-Qi activists. They were also beaten to death, and rope marks on their hands and the extent of the beating implies that they were tortured before death. 8 men were arrested in suspicion of committing the crimes, all members of the Green Gang in Nanjing. However, they only sat in a cell for 5 hours, as Qi quickly informed the Nanjing police commissioner that the prisoners should be released immediately, as they are not connected to the murders at all. Qi himself announced that he would form a team to investigate these deaths, however, progress on this is very unlikely. With these activists' deaths, the anti-Qi protests in Nanjing have dispursed, and the city is safe once again."

lep.42.d:0 "While stopping to load more supplies onto a train in [getlepattacklocationkmt], multiple KMT agents snuck up to the train, and placed multiple bombs beneath it. When they went off, they completely destroyed the train, all the supplies, and the railway it was on. These terrorists have still not been tracked down, most likely having taken refuge in some of the peasants' houses."

lep.43.t:0 "Officers Assassinated in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
lep.43.d:0 "Tensions remain high in the South, as we are forced to send more and more troops and military police over to keep the region secure. During some training of new military police in [getlepattacklocationkmt], multiple Kuomintang agents infiltrated the barracks and shot multiple officers before being killed by the training troops. Following the death of those agents, multiple small bombs went off around the barracks, injuring three and costing lots to repair."

lep.44.t:0 "Factory Bombed in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
lep.44.d:0 "Even though the factory in [getlepattacklocationkmt] was thought to be secure, it still fell victim to Kuomintang agents. Just around midnight, suddenly explosions echoed throughout the area, as a bomb were set off in the industrial district, damaging a factory. This is sure to be bad for business."
lep.44.a:0 "Damn them"

lep.45.t:0 "Gunfight in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]"
lep.45.d:0 "Since the defeat of Chairman Wang Jingwei, tensions have remained high in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]. The military presence and Kuomintang sympathies have remained very high. It was bound to boil over eventually, as it has today. A man, dressed as a regular peasant, was walking past a group of soldiers, when suddenly he drew a pistol and began to shoot at them. Though that man was killed quickly by the troops, it was in fact a distraction, as while the man was being killed, a large group of Kuomintang troops charged at the soldiers from the other side, and shot them all. As the day went on, more loyal soldiers joined the fighting, but were countered by more Kuomintang attacks. Dozens, maybe hundreds were killed, but thankfully, by the evening, the fighting had dwindled, and order was secured."
lep.45.a:0 "I'm sure it won't be the last"

lep.46.t:0 "Heavy Factory Bombing in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
lep.46.d:0 "Though the KMT have been defeated on the field, their terror campaign rages on. Today, multiple bombs were set off in [getlepattacklocationkmt], centred around the main industrial complexes. Though there were no casualties, the factory has been very badly damaged, and will be unable to work for a while. From what the Kuomintang have said, we should probably get used to events like this, until we have rooted them out for good."

lep.47.t:0 "Battle in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]"
lep.47.d:0 "[getlepattacklocationcitykmt], still a hotbed of Kuomintang activities, has faced a massive confrontation by the KMT. Around 400 Kuomintang troops went into the main square of the city, killed any police and soldiers in it, and quickly entrenched themselves with hastily put together fortifications. It took multiple pushes from hundreds of our own troops to be able to get back into the square and clear it of their guerillas, who quickly retreated back into the back streets, eventually harboured in the homes of many of the peasants living there. However, the officer leading the attack decided that these KMT must be rooted out of [getlepattacklocationcitykmt], and so sent out around 200 soldiers on a killing spree throughout the city. Hundreds of civilians were lined up and shot, and the houses of many were burned to the ground. When Qi heard of what some are calling the [getlepattacklocationcitykmt] Massacre, he had the officer arrested, but that was too little, too late."

lep.48.t:0 "Mass Railway Bombings in the South"
lep.48.d:0 "Early today, multiple bombs were set off on a railway across the south of our territory. This was a very well organised attack, due to the amount of bombs spread out across multiple provinces. The attack has crippled the railway and will be felt throughout, greatly hurting our abilities to move troops and deal with the KMT, not to mention repair the damage. This is a disaster."
lep.48.a:0 "They must be dealt with"

lep.49.t:0 "Multiple Factory Bombings"
lep.49.d:0 "In the very early morning, multiple factories were bombed across the south in our country. The attacks were obviously coordinated closely and can have only come from the KMT. However, this time, there were already many workers present and dozens have been killed. This has been among the most brutal attacks the KMT have perpetrated."

lep.50.d:0 "Months of tracking KMT activities, months of frustrating their efforts and months of planning have finally paid off. The new headquarters of the few terrorists that remained after Wang Jingwei's defeat has been located and completely razed to the ground. Now that we have worked against them for so long, their resources are completely exhausted and we can finally call the movement of the Left KMT destroyed. Their traitorous rebellion is no more."

lep.51.d:0 "Yiguandao followers, who are weirdly upset over opium use in Shandong and Jiangsu, have attacked and destroyed an illegal opium storage warehouse in Xuzhou. While having less opium isn't necessarily bad, they also killed everyone nearby. When soldiers arrived, they then continued to resist. We cannot let the Yiguandao religion continue to exist, as its followers cause too much chaos."

lep.53.t:0 "Soldiers attacked in Northern Village"
lep.53.d:0 "Soldiers on patrol in a northern village were attacked out of nowhere by a large band of dozens of homeless Yiguandao followers. These people, whose association with their religion has caused them to already lose everything, reverted to robbing and looting, which had caused the village to institute a patrol. But still the village wasn't safe, as nearly twenty have now been killed."
lep.53.a:0 "Those rats"

lep.54.t:0 "Town Invaded by Yiguandao Adherents"
lep.54.d:0 "Again the Yiguandao have caused massive chaos by invading and occupying an entire town. After the Yiguandao expelled all the former owners, soldiers were sent out to investigate, only for them to see the entire town barricaded. A large amount of soldiers were required to drive away the Yiguandao adherents before the village people could return home. Hundreds of Yiguandao were killed, and many soldiers too. Things are getting too crazy."
lep.54.a:0 "That is bad"

lep.55.t:0 "Yiguandao Fanatics Take Over Military Barracks"
lep.55.d:0 "In response to recent military actions against the Yiguandao, they have no chosen to attack and take over a military complex at the edge of a city in Jiangsu. Hundreds swarmed the barracks, killing many soldiers, after which barricaded themselves within. Soon, the city fell into chaos as looting became widespread. There are even reports of rapes. The military action required to take back the barracks was brutal, leaving nearly a hundred dead."
lep.55.a:0 "Things are getting worse"

lep.56.t:0 "Railway Occupied in Jiangsu"
lep.56.d:0 "The Yiguandao, again showing their anger at their treatment, have barricaded and occupied an entire railway, even destroying it at some parts. The action required to take it back left many dead. While before they mostly left the infrastructure alone, they have now begun to also attack the lifeblood of our country, on which much of our economy rests. The Yiguandao have proven to be a major threat."
lep.56.a:0 "Our railroads must be protected"

lep.57.t:0 "Massacre of Yiguandao Followers"
lep.57.d:0 "A stand-off between Yiguandao adherents and soldiers in a Yiguandao camp has escalated into a massacre. After the religious fanatics refused to leave, which they had been ordered by the soldiers as they were harassing nearby city folk, the soldiers began doing this by force. This lead to a counter-attack, which made the officer in charger decide to begin shooting. However, the shooting didn't stop until their was not a single Yiguandao follower left. Nearly a thousand are dead. While Qi Xieyuan has fired the officer for this excessive use of force, Yiguandao unrest is likely to only get worse."
lep.57.a:0 "This doesn't look good"

lep.58.t:0 "End of the Yiguandao"
lep.58.d:0 "The Yiguandao threat can finally said to be neutralized as the last sect was destroyed, its members thrown into jail. It took a lot of policies and military action, but now the northern countryside can finally be declared safe again. The damage that the rotten religion of the Yiguandao did to our country will long live in infamy. But now they are gone and we won't let them come back."
lep.58.a:0 "Finally peace"

lep.59.t:0 "Qi Meets with Jiangzhe Caifa"
lep.59.d:0 "Compared to the shady low down meeting with Du Yuesheng, Qi's meeting with the bankers of the Jiangzhe Caifa was a breath of fresh air. Meeting in one of the bankers' mansions in Shanghai, Qi and a few of his officers were treated to delicious food served by the bankers' maids and servants. Armed mercenaries stood guard around the building while the bankers arrived. Preliminary discussions were nice and calm, however the attitude changed when the group got to business.\n\nLeague-Marshal Qi made his stance clear: for the Jiangzhe Caifa to continue to do as much business as they do throughout the League, they must offer Nanjing resources and loans to be used \"to protect their business interests for them\". Of course, the bankers did not react well to this, claiming that they could protect their own financial institutions, and anyway, their profits from the League were minor compared to the profits they've found in the Legation Cities. Qi was ready for this line though, as he stated clearly that should they not give these resources to Nanjing \"the Green Gang will make sure you never do business in Shanghai ever again\". Several of the men were shocked at what they heard. Perhaps Qi had made a mistake. It was an open fact that many of these bankers were also paying off the Green Gang, and most likely have better relations with their leaders than Qi, who's only met Du Yuesheng once.\n\nAs the bankers began to discuss the resources to be sent to Nanjing, though, a wave of relief flowed through Qi. After another couple of hours of discussion it was decided, and the loans and resources will start coming in soon."
lep.59.a:0 "What a fine businessman Qi is."

lep.60.t:0 "Supplies from the Jiangzhe Caifa"
lep.60.d:0 "Finally, we have received a large shipment of money and weapons, sent from the Jiangzhe Caifa in Shanghai."
lep.60.a:0 "Wonderful."

lep.100.t:0 "Nanjing Lives On"
lep.100.d:0 "After many months of fighting, we have finally been able to crush the enemies that oppose us. Traitors, Kuomintang and Yiguandao, all have been crushed by the iron fist of Qi Xieyuan. However, his leadership is still not secure. Though the Kuomintang have been beaten in the field, reports have came back stating they will continue to fight a guerrilla war against us. The Yiguandao seem to have issued a similar statement. Also, as proven by Chen's betrayal, even those who claim to be loyal to us may be waiting to betray us. We must remain diligent."
lep.100.a:0 "Ah, victory."

lep.102.t:0 "The Governor Question"
lep.102.d:0 "League-Marshal Qi never trusted Chen Taioyuan. He was anti-German, refusing to see the benefit from our European friends, and his loyalty shifted many times, most between Sun Chuanfang and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria. It was no surprise, then, when Chen rose up against the League, and brought it to the edge of ruin. It is clear that, due to his anti-German policies, his province of Anhui is in severe need of investment and development. Therefore, the question of who shall become the next governor of Anhui is paramount.\n\nReally, there are two main options. The first is Xie Hongxun, a relatively minor military officer and bureaucrat in Nanjing. However, his main appeal as governor is the relatively close relationship he had to Sun Chuanfang. Many still see Qi as a usurper, so placing a Sun loyalist to such a high level position would be a popular move, and he is weak enough that he will be easy to control.\n\nHowever, there is a second option. With the problem all starting from Anhui's breakaway, perhaps it is time to centralise the League slightly more. League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan is always an option, so that Anhui can be kept on a closer leash to Nanjing, though it might not be that popular with the population at large."

lep.112.d:0 "For many years we have greatly profited from the situation in China. Though we worked with the Qing, most German deals were done through their more receptive southern counterpart: Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces. However, the situation in the League is clearly unstable, and to make matters worse Sun himself has been shot. Thankfully, his replacement in Nanjing, Qi Xieyuan, is likely to become even more reliant on us than Sun was. The admiralty is recommending that we send him equipment immediately, to prop him up amidst what appears to be a rapidly worsening crisis in eastern China."
lep.112.a:0 "Send them guns."

lep.113.t:0 "Arrival of German Weapons"

lep.114.t:0 "New Governor for Zhejiang"
lep.114.d:0 "With both Shangguan Yunxiang and Chen Yi both no longer governors of Zhejiang, a new governor is needed to replace them. There are three main candidates:\n\nFirst is Zhou Fengqi, garrison commander in Nanjing and Sun Chuanfang loyalist. Though he is not truly loyal to our regime, perhaps such a promotion might convince him to stay in line.\n\nSecond is Zhang Qingxu, a low level bureaucrat originally from Beijing, who joined Sun's government only a few months before his assassination. Though he is relatively minor, his organisational skill is notable, and the skills he got from working in Beijing will help him develop the province.\n\nThird is Xia Chao, a minor commander with no real notable victories to his name. Really, he has one main positive, that being his loyalty to League-Marshal Qi. Having worked under Qi for years, he might be the best choice if we want to keep Zhejiang closely linked to Nanjing."
lep.114.a:0 "Zhou Fengqi."

lep.114.c:0 "Xia Chao."

lep.115.t:0 "Governor for Fujian"
lep.115.d:0 "Throughout the League War, Fujian was ruled by Zhou Yinren. Zhou, a competent general, over the years has brought a level of control to Fujian that was not achieved by governors of previous decades. However, Zhou has one main negative, that being his extreme loyalty to the previous League-Marshal Sun Chuangfang. Having been classmates many years ago, their relationship was always a close one. It was this friendship that got Zhou to his position, not any sign of impressive skill or ability. Though Fujian has developed decently under Zhou, it still remains the most impoverished province in the League. We must make the choice of whether to keep Zhou, or whether to put in someone new.\n\nThe other option for governor of Fujian is Kong Zhaotong, a relatively minor military leader from Fujian. However, Kong's main appeal is his close relationship to Qi Xieyuan, wiht Kong acting as one of Qi's commanders directly in Fujian. Kong showed decent ability while fighting the Kuomintang, and his anti-socialst credentials are up to standard. His close links to Qi means he must be far more competent than the Sun loyalist Zhou. However, perhaps experience is better than loyalty..."

Fang Benren, after graduating from Beijing Military Acadenmy, worked in the Guangdong army, eventually as its commander-in-chief, then eventually as a high level commander and general in the League army. Having had strong links to Sun Chuangfang, and a suspicion of Northern Zhili leader Wu Peifu, he has gained lots of influence in League politics. Not appointing him to this position would be very dangerous for our regime, so he is the only choice."

lep.117.t:0 "Governor for Jiangxi"
lep.117.d:0 "Jiangxi, a poor, underdeveloped province of the League, has been under the leadership of Deng Ruzhou for many years. Under him, Jiangxi has become a hotbed for German investments, with much of the province being dependent on German cash. Deng has got comfortable in his position, perhaps too comfortable. Importantly, another man wishes to become Jiangxi's governor. Fang Benren, after graduating from Beijing Military Acadenmy, worked in the Guangdong army, eventually as its commander-in-chief, then eventually as a high level commander and general in the League army. Having had strong links to Sun Chuangfang, and a suspicion of Northern Zhili leader Wu Peifu, he has gained lots of influence in League politics.

Now, however, the Nanking-Kommission has expressed 'severe dismay' at our lack of support for the conflict and urged us to intervene. To sweeten the deal they have promised to supply some German weapons and capital. While we can refuse, accepting seems like the far better choice."

The opening is noteworthy for a few reasons, first among them the prominent involvement of Chinese engineers in the construction despite its significant funding by the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung, also known as the AOG, which has turned the work into something of a cause celebre.\n\nThose less optimistic have been quick to point out the AOG's newfound access to rich mineral deposits, as well as Jingdezhen Porcelain, which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin.\n\nDespite concerns, a threatened attack upon the opening ceremony by Kuomintang agents did not take place."

Among them is the new Zhegan Railway.\n\nThe AOG already possesses controlling shares in a number of lines across Eastern China, several of which it directly financed, but this dashes the hopes of those who believed the new railway might represent a more equal future for Germans and Chinese. While Chinese management will be permitted to remain, they will now answer to a German directory board. Though scarcely admitted to the public, few authorities in the League seem to have been forewarned of this development, and the police response to protests has been slower than normal."

Intellectuals have condemned the move in domestic papers, followed by prominent Anglo-American publications out of Shanghai, and echoed by Syndicalist party periodicals found on factory floors. More troubling however, the news has spread rapidly by word of mouth, and has grown all the more outrageous and fantastical in the process.\n\nTales now describe extensive webs of conspiracy, disappearances of outspoken individuals, and the supposed transfer of millions of Yuan into the League-Marshal's own pockets. The publics reaction has been predictably furious, and protests have already spread from Zhejiang and Jiangxi to the major coastal cities, including the foreign settlements."

More disturbingly, some local garrisons have stepped back and allowed the unrest to grow, unwilling to risk being labelled 'Hanjian' or 'race traitors'. In order to ward off intervention from Beijing, advisers from the Nanking-Kommission have suggested that League-Marshal Sun publicly declare that the situation is under control.\n\nElements of several divisions based in Nanjing stand ready to be deployed to cities along the lower Yangtze, where protests are largest, and provincial garrisons could be given the green light to take whatever action they deem necessary to quell the open dissent."

In the barracks and in the streets, soldiers are being riled up by Yiguandao adherents, seeking converts and preaching against foreign 'wickedness', while the Kuomintang and other leftist groups hide in the shadows, disseminating propaganda and denouncing 'imperialist collaboration'.

While it is a blazen grab for power, without AOG backing, the commission itself is almost functionally useless."
lepaog.28.a:0 "Allow a German majority."
lepaog.28.b:0 "Acquiese, but try to curtail their influence."

lepaog.29.t:0 "AOG Requests Renegotiation of German Rights"
lepaog.29.d:0 "With the continued success of the Eastern Resources Commission, the AOG has once again called for an elevation of German interests in the region. While German citizens and businesses already receive ample privileges, the AOG has asked that we elevate these rights in perpuity, to 'solidify the successful Sino-German Relationship.'"
lepaog.29.a:0 "A reasonable request."
lepaog.29.b:0 "The situation as it stands is fine."

lepaog.30.t:0 "German Industrial Expansion"
lepaog.30.d:0 "Just as before, our business with the Germans has proven fabulously profitable. With new resource deposits being opened and their wealth within flowing (mostly) into our collars, we once again have our friends in Tsingtau to thank."
lepaog.30.a:0 "Business is booming."

lepaog.31.t:0 "AOG Implements Exclusive Economic Zones"
lepaog.31.d:0 "Seizing upon their disproportionate influence in our country, the AOG has implemented a policy of economic exclusivity for German Interests, effectively cinching their monopoly on League investment. While mostly a simple acknowledgement of the present reality, it is concerning that the AOG holds such formidable power inside our own government."
lepaog.31.a:0 "This is for the Good of China."

lepaog.32.t:0 "AOG Implements Free Trade Policy"
lepaog.32.d:0 "Once again flexing their political muscle, the AOG has overruled our officials and instituted a free trade policy for German goods. While this might not be too damaging, it is dangerous to our own internal stability that we are so beholden to the AOG's whims."
lepaog.32.a:0 "This is for the good of China, we swear..."

lepaog.33.t:0 "German Economic Takeover"
lepaog.33.d:0 "In a final economic coup-de-tat, the AOG has successfully Germanized our economy. German banks, factories, and shops throng the streets, and the Mark is more used than the Yuan. Our economy is now effectively that of a German client state."
lepaog.33.a:0 "Oh dear."


lepaog.50.t:0 "League-Ostasien Relations"
lepaog.50.d:0 "The Ostasien administration is the chief backer of the AOG in Asia, and AOG interests are heavily tied to theirs. In a show of collaboration, the AOG has asked that we extend formal diplomatic overtures to the administration, to cement our shared economic interests."
lepaog.50.a:0 "Better friends than enemies."

lepaog.51.t:0 "AOG Requests Our Support!"
lepaog.51.d:0 "With Indochina in open revolt, the AOG has requested that we support Ostasien in quelling the rebellion, both to help a friend in a time of need, and to safeguard against a possible syndicalist threat in future years."
lepaog.51.a:0 "They shall have our full support!"
lepaog.51.b:0 "Send some equipment their way."
lepaog.51.c:0 "They're on their own."

lepaog.52.t:0 "Ostasien Border Agreements"
lepaog.52.d:0 "With Ostasia and the League once again bordering each other, the AOG has suggested an semi-open border policy between our nations, as a show of goodwill and further economic collaboration."
lepaog.52.a:0 "There are no borders between friends."
lepaog.52.b:0 "Let's keep things professional."

lepaog.53.t:0 "League-Ostasien Connection Deepens"
lepaog.53.d:0 "As AOG influence grows, so to does our relationship with Ostasia. To wit, a new economic trade agreement has been drafted by AOG businesses to boost trade between us."
lepaog.53.a:0 "Always good to have friends."

lepaog.54.t:0 "AOG Requests Ostasien Docking Rights"
lepaog.54.d:0 "While Ostasia already has sizable dockyards in Tsingtau, the AOG has requested that we allow German ships dock in League cities also, as a simple precaution in the case of chaotic naval actions in the China Sea."
lepaog.54.a:0 "Granted."
lepaog.54.b:0 "Let them keep their ships in Tsingtau."

lepaog.55.t:0 "AOG Requests Ostasien Military Access"
lepaog.55.d:0 "In a rather audacious request, the AOG has asked for us to give military access to Ostasien troops to protect German interests in our country. While this would be a dramatic ceding of sovereignty, the level of AOG influence in our government makes it difficult to refuse."
lepaog.55.a:0 "A reasonable request."
lepaog.55.b:0 "We must keep some level of distance."

lepaog.56.t:0 "AOG Requests a Full Military Guarantee"
lepaog.56.d:0 "With tensions with Japan on the rise, the AOG has demanded that we make a full showing of support to the German colonies in Asia, and that we guarantee a League response in the event of any attack on German territories. This would effectively throw our lot in with the Reichspakt in the event of war, but may be an inevitable conclusion if war reaches our borders."
lepaog.56.a:0 "Their safety is ours."
lepaog.56.b:0 "This has gone too far!"

lepaog.57.t:0 "Transferring of the Concessions"
lepaog.57.d:0 "In a demonstration of power, the AOG has decided to transfer direct control of the concessions out of our hands, and into those of the Ostasien administration. As humiliating as this is, it was an inevitable conclusion to the almost complete German control of our nation."
lepaog.57.a:0 "It was inevitable."

lepaog.58.t:0 "Von Falkhenhausen Returns to Active Duty"
lepaog.58.d:0 "With the fight against the secessionists threatening the safety of the German concession cities, the leader of the concesion defense force, Alexander Von Falkhenhausen, has returned to active duty to help our fight, and has offered his leadership to our troops. The assistance of such a competent general, and the implicit support in our fight, is a great boon to our war effort."
lepaog.58.a:0 "Any help is welcome."

On top of those people were the governors of the different provinces, whom themselves acted with relative autonomy and answered only to League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang. When the League collapsed with Chen Taioyuans uprising, this web broke apart, with many people rebelling or seizing power for themselves locally, and with governors trying to escape to get safety in Nanjing. With the League now back to a relative state of decency, it is high time we work on sending these governors back, and in many cases getting new governors, so that work can continue."
