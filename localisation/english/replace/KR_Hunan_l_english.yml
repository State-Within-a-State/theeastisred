###Leader Descriptions###

WU_GUANGXIN_LEADER_DESC:0 "Born in Anhui in 1881, Wu Guangxin would end up joining the Qing army and would be transferred to the Artillery Section of the Beiyang Rapid Arms School  in 1902. In 1910, the Fengtian Mixed Association (the 13th Mixed Association) was unified. In 1911, he was appointed as the co-president of the third town of Beiyang. When the Wuchang Uprising broke out, he followed Duan Qirui to Hubei and served as a counselor of the Second Army. In February 1912, after Yuan Shikai became president, he appointed Wu Guangxin as the commander of the Beiyang government's army brigade in Anhui Province. He was awarded Army Major General on November 26, 1912. On July 31, 1913, he was promoted to the rank of Army Lieutenant General, and on September 1, he was promoted to Army Lieutenant General. e was appointed commander of the 20th Army Division and was stationed in Yichang. A " Preparatory Committee " was established in Beijing on August 14, 1915. Wu Guangxin resigned along with Duan Qirui to show his opposition to the imperial system. On August 26, Yuan Shikai ordered Fan Guozhang to replace Wu Guangxin as commander of the 20th Division. During the National Defense War in March 1916 , General Counselor Ren followed Cao Kun to Sichuan and captured Naxi , Jiang'an and other places. After Yuan Shikai's death, Duan Qirui became Prime Minister. In late July 1916, Wu was appointed governor of Hunan. After being kicked out breifly by Tan Yankai's forces, he would charge back in 1920 and retake the governorship on Hunan, and would start an era of martial law in 1924, in this time he would form close alliances with Zhao Hengti( a warlord sympathetic to Chen Jiongming's federalism) and also Tang Xiangming. As 1936 approaches Wu fears his governance may not survive the next decade."
MAO_ZEDONG_LEADER_DESC:0 "Mao Zedong was the eldest born son of a well off Hunan farmer in Changsha, on December 26th 1893. Mao Zedong. In 1911, he would move to Changsha where he would learn about the revolutionary ideas of Dr Sun Yat Sen, who at the time was carrying out a revolution against the Qing. In May, a movement was launched in China to oppose the Qing government's selling of railway rights; Mao Zedong and his classmates were involved in the struggle ; Mao Zedong and another classmate first cut off their pigtails and forced more than a dozen people to cut off their pigtails as well. He would briefly join the military of the Hunan provincial government but would later be discharged. In 1918 would found the Xinmin Society along with Cai Hesen and Xiao Zisheng, initially trying to raise money to go to France, Mao would move to Beijing and work as a library assistant to Li Dazhao (who had come under the sway of Marxism). Mao would come to move away from anarchism and support Marxist scientific socialism, and much like his mentor Li Dazhao, would promote and embrace the October revolution. This would culminate with the establishment of the Chinese communist party in 1921, though this would be short lived, as the Russian revolution would fail and the French syndicalist revolution, would split the party between Li Dazhao and Chen Duxui(who supported syndicalism). This would result in the formation of the CSP and the CSP replacing the CPC in the united front with the Kuomintang. Mao wouldn't join the CSP, due to the CSP disagreeing with his "Investigation report on the peasant movement in Hunan" and emphasis on Peasant socialist revolution in terms of peasant organization. Mao would stay with the CPC in Hunan, gathering support base in his branch til the party's collapse in 1927 due to Li Dazhao being imprisoned. Mao would then revive the Xinmin society and try to make it into a Marxist-Leninist organization surrounding China's material conditions, leading to the creation of Revolutionary Agrarianism. Revolutionary Agrarianism, would spread in more radical and secretive circles within some Chinese peasant socialist circles. Mao and the Xinmin Society would be forced to go partially underground due to harsh measures put in by Wu Guangxin, but the group would still survive, with also some help from the KMT, in which Mao has become both supportive and wary of. By 1936 Mao Zedong still leads the Xinmin Society and continues to gain support from the Hunan Peasants Association and the Hunan Workers Union in which include people like his brother Mao Zemin."

Initially neutral, Tan aligned himself with Sun Yat-sen’s Kuomintang during the National Protection War and the Constitutional Protection War, during which Hunan was the scene of heavy fighting between the Southern Government and the Zhili Clique. With the defeat of Dr. Sun's Southern Government, Wu Guangxin and his Zhili allies would consolidate power over Hunan, turning it into a Wu's own strong hold. Though Wu would have to work with certain figures like Zhao Hengti and Tang Xiangming in order to please certain cliques under the Imperial Qing authority, though in that time he would seem to piss of certain warlords around him, though no action against him would be taken due to his connections to Beijing. Wu would end up enacting martial law on the province in order to deal with the issues of Spirit Soldier rebellions and Socialist resistance, in 1924. This would go on for year, with Wu facing an ever growing threat of assassination toward him. As 1936 hits Hunan, Martial Law reaches its 12th year and the Province of Hunan faces crisis of debt accumulated by Wu and his spending habbits on the army."

The concern of his advisors, being the recent increase of banditry along the countryside of Hunan. Just yesterday, news had spread of Wu's hunting trip had come to a short end, with Wu being shot by a sniper whilst hunting in the woods.\n\nNow the provincial government is in chaos, with the advisory council (formed by Wu and his military advisors in order for him to govern Hunan) now deciding on choosing a governor to succeed the now deceased Wu Guangxin. First option is Tang Xiangming, a former governor of Hunan himself, Tang is an advisor loyal to the republican cause and follow unique third way movements, that go against both the rightwing Qing and the leftwing KMT, this being Tang's alignment with the movements of Carsun Chang and also the Buddhist Generals Tang Shengzhi. The other candidate is someone who also is consider a more third way aligned supporter. That being Zhao Hengti, initially a big support of Tang Yankai's short lived Hunan constitution, Zhao believes in the implantation of democracy in Hunan as soon as possible, as part of his aspirations of creating a federalist China under the ideas of him and his ally Chen Jiongming. But even then there is questions raised about how loyal they are to their democratic ideas, but only time will tell after the decision of military advisory council."

First being joining leaders in Beijing, in which would mean subservience, that could either eliminate or expand Tang's grasp on power. 2nd is proclaiming a state loyal to Tang's ideas, though detaching itself from ideas of Democracy, seeing it as a failure enacted under the failed dream of the Wuchang uprising. 3rd is the implentation of the self proclaimed third way, and following a new ideology called National Socialism, created by Carsun Chang. The final option is choosing to align with some of the Hunanese generals, with the likes of Tang Shengzhi, who promotes ideas of a Buddhist China, built partially on principles of socialism."

In Zhenyuan, there is two factions that dominate the region. The Greater China Buddhist Society, lead by Shi Dingwu.\n\nThe Greater China Buddhist Society is a secret society formed by Shi Dingwu in 1930, with help from the spirit soldier rebellions at the time, Shi's forces have managed to grow quite quickly in the past few years. Shi's goals are to create a new Holy Buddhist Kingdom of China, in which he will crown himself as Emperor and start a new dynasty.\n\nThe other faction in Zhenyuan, is Chen Quzhen's Ge Lao Hui, despite being a relatively old and well known secret organization within Hunan, Chen Quzhen would assume control over the society after the fall its leader in 1917, with Chen succeeding and becoming the new 'Elder Brother' of the society, with himself cutting off ties with the KMT in the early 20's due to the KMT's failure in their attempts at overthrowing Yuan Shikai. Chen would use his new found power to fund a new religious-cultist criminal Empire within Hunan, with a major monopoly on the Sichuan-Hunan-Yunnan cross border opium trade.\n\nFinally the last formation of the bandits that have a major influence in areas of the province is the Kuomintang-CSP guerilla forces. Though formed after the collapse of the KMT's main force in the 20's, the KMT-CSP forces would form with aims of helping workers unions and even some peasant groups against the Hunan governor. The KMT-CSP forces have been sited across the province, with it being one issue of concern with the governor.\n\nNow only time will tell, on how victorious we shall be against these bandits."

Later, he would go to Japan for further studies, where he met budding leaders of the Tongmenghui. He would convert to their cause after meeting Sun Yat-sen, and after graduation from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, he would join the Xinhai revolution breaking out in 1911. A long-time KMT general, he would lead the NRA's invasion of Hunan during the Northern expedition and join the establishment of a provincial government under Tang Shengzhi. The failure of the expedition however, saw Cheng go into exile - at least until the emergence of a rebellion in Fujian. There he would again rise to prominence. However, with the announcement of a new election in Hunan, Cheng decided to go on leave from his post and contest the Governorship from sitting governor Zhao Hengti.\n\nWith Cheng emerging victorious in the election, he is now free to begin implementing the Three Principles of the People and the KMT programme in the province.

However, realising the political situation of late 19th century China, he instead pursued a career in the military. He attended the Hunan Military Academy and then went to Japan, where he studied and met revolutionaries such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, and Li Lijun. In 1905, he met Sun Yat-sen and joined Sun’s Tongmenghui. He would graduate from the Imperial Japanese Academy alongside Tang Jiyao, specialising in the field of artillery.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911, he took part in the Battle of Changsha. He then became military governor of Hunan but was driven out when Yuan Shikai took power.  He would demonstrate his loyalty to Sun’s ideals by joining the Kuomintang and aiding Sun in the National Protection War and the Constitutional Protection Movements. One of Sun’s closest allies in his war against Chen Jiongming, he became a military instructor preparing for the Northern expedition.\n\nHowever, when the Northern Expedition did come, he led the Sixth Army in the Battle for Nanchang. However, after the expedition’s defeat, he retreated with the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army to the Jiangfu Insurgent Zone.

As Zhao emerged victorious in the 1921 election, he would bring Tang to prominence but this alliance would soon end with Tang growing jealous of Zhao's favouritism towards other military commands. Tang bided his time however, and saw his chance with the 1926 Northern Expedition. Joining up with the National Revolutionary Army, Tang ousted his former master and established his own administration under the auspices of the KMT. Deviating from his new bosses however, he began a Buddhisisation campaign, a syncretic Buddhist-Leftist programme. This would not last long however, before German intervention allowed for the Zhili government pushed out KMT forces from the region and brought Zhao back in tow. Tang fled to the concessions, where he would hide for several years in exile.\n\nThis was not the end however of Tang Shengzhi. Tang Shengming, his younger brother, proved popular enough to remain a general within the Hunan military and soon enough was able to rekindle support among the officers for Tang Shengzhi to return. Taking a risk, the older Tang returned to Hunan where Zhao proved too weak to order his arrest, instead opting to outmanoeuvre his old General in elections.

Although initially successful, the expedition would collapse with German intervention. Despite the elder Tang's exile from Hunan following the failure of the Northern Expedition and his Buddhist Socialist programme, Tang Shengming's rare ability to get along with virtually anybody resulted in him remaining in Hunan and even gaining a position of prominence within the Hunan military.

There he would join the Tongmenghui, participating in the Xinhai revolution before returning to Hunan in 1916 to join its local army. Although initially joining the Kuomintang during their Northern Expedition into Hunan, a timely defection by He Yaozu and his division helped shield him from the major political ramifications of the defeat.

Although his family did not have much in the way of means, Peng would listen to his grandfather, a veteran of the Taiping rebellion, describe the ideals of social and economic equality. Initially able to go to a traditional Confucian school, his family's declining economic prosperity forced him to withdraw and beg for money to help support his family. After losing many of his family members to poverty, including his mother, he found himself working at a coal mine. It was around then that the Xinhai revolution broke out - and Peng found himself further destitute as the economy declined. He would join a local warlord army as an enlisted man and rise through the ranks - at one point his regiment joined with Tang Shengzhi's army. There Peng fought for Sun Yat-sen's forces against Wu Peifu's local allies. His attempt to join the Kuomintang in 1922 left him disillusioned however, and he initially returned home to become a farmer. Dissatisfied, he then applied to the Hunan military academy, taking on the name Dehuai. His regiment would initially back the Kuomintang during its invasion of Hunan, but Peng himself hesitated. This hesitation proved to be useful when the tide turned, and Peng successfully defected back to Zhili lines."

Tang Shengzhi would then take him under his wing, and He Jian would fight for the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition. The collapse of the NRA in 1927, however, initially set him adrift but a general amnesty in Hunan for those who were willing to defect proved to be a fortuitous opportunity for many of Tang's subordinates.

A friend of Chen Geng, he would initially flirt with the leftist part of the party, but the collapse of the Kuomintang in 1927 meant the future of the then 20 year old officer was drastically altered. Set adrift, he went to Japan to study for several years before returning home to Hunan to offer his services. There, he found plenty of old associates of Cheng Qian and the KMT serving in the Hunan army and was able to leverage his connections to slowly achieve a place of prominence in the regional forces."

Nonetheless, it would appear he had inherited some military skills from his father, a minor Qing officer, and at age 20 he began his long career as a guerilla leader after he killed a tax assessor out of revenge for the murder of his indebted uncle. Since then his legend as an outlaw and a Robin-hood figure has only grown, as He Long and his trusty signature knife built a local army right in time for the rise of the Kuomintang in 1920. A teacher and commander during the Northern expedition, He Long would soon find himself aligned with socialist elements of the party while serving under Zhang Fakui. The defeat of the KMT during the Northern Expedition has not sated his desire for change in China, and though he has fled back home to Hunan, he still commands the respect of his soldiers. His skills as a revolutionary are not to be underestimated, and he will be a useful asset to any army."

The failure of the Northern expedition drove the young officer underground, where he would lead a brief resistance before accepting a general amnesty offer to join the local Hunan army under Peng Dehuai. A promising officer, Teng has achieved regional prominence despite his previous ties with revolutionary groups.

No matter what the political system is, it must be governed by the law before it can be implemented and maintained. If the rule of law is not established, it will inevitably lead to private rule. It is not enough as a lesson. If private governance is prevalent, the country will never be able to get on the right track. Second, regarding the relationship between the state and individual rights. Third, regarding the relationship between the rule of law and the rule of man. Generally speaking, all thinkers who advocate the rule of law will clearly oppose the rule of man. However, Chen Qitian is one of the few thinkers who advocates the simultaneous development, combination and interaction of the rule of law and the rule of man.\n\n1st Point: [HunanYCPChenProgramFirst]\n2nd Point: [HunanYCPChenProgramSecond]\n3rd Point: [HunanYCPChenProgramThrid]"

### Events ###

hnn.1.t:0 "The Province of Hunan"
hnn.1.d:0 "The Xiang Clique in Hunan was once a major clique in Southern China. Under the leadership of the two cliques of Tan Yankai and Tang Xiangming, the province of Hunan was influential in Southern Chinese and Tongmenghui politics.\n\nIn 1916, Tang Jiyao declared the independence of Yunnan, leading to multiple other provinces declaring independence along with it - Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and many others. Hunan found itself under siege, and the National Protection Alliance put as its governor Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General. He enacted his Buddhisisation Program, but was pushed back a few years later, being replaced by the Federalist Zhao Hengti as governor. After the end of the Zhili victory over Southern China, it was incorporated into the League of Eight Provinces, with Zhao Hengti declaring his personal alliegiance to lie with Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing.\n\nWith Sun Chuanfang's death, however, Hunan, one of the already autonomous provinces of the League of Eight Provinces, has regained full provincial autonomy under Zhao Hengti once again. The time ahead is a turbulent one - The brother of Tang Shengzhi, Tang Shengming, is making attempts to bring his brother back to Hunan and into power once again. Cheng Qian, the Nationalist-KMT supporter, also looks to take over the province.\n\nTo the south is the Liangguang Clique, led by Chen Jiongming. Even though Zhao Hengti claims to be a federalist, Chen shows it. To the west are the Cliques of Sichuan and Yunnan, eyeing us with hungry looks. To the North are Hunan's friends - the Northern Zhili, but their power may not last forever."
hnn.1.a:0 "It is time for action."

#Choosing Path Events

hnn.2.t:0 "Restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution"
hnn.2.d:0 "Zhao Hengti, the governor, is obsessed with legal procedures, no matter how rigged they are. Because of this, he has suggested that the province restore the old provincial constitution enacted in the 1920s. The future of the province depends on his decision."
hnn.2.a:0 "Restore the Constitution!"
hnn.2.b:0 "Pfft, who even needs legal procedures?"

hnn.3.t:0 "The Constitution Restored"
hnn.3.d:0 "We have decided to restore the constitution. We are now, in name and in some way in government, a democracy. We shall keep our land free and safe, and all our citizens will know the freedom of Hunan."
hnn.3.a:0 "Three Cheers for Hunan!"

hnn.4.t:0 "The Constitution Rejected"
hnn.4.d:0 "We have decided to reject the restoration of the constitution. We are a province, not a republic. There is no need for us to do so, to repeat the mistakes of our past that led to us becoming part of the League. Governor Zhao has teared up the Constitution with his hands and left it to burn. It has been decided - Hunan will no longer be democratic."
hnn.4.a:0 "Three Cheers for Hunan!"

hnn.5.t:0 "Elections Announced"
hnn.5.d:0 "With the restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution, Governor Zhao Hengti has decided to announce the new Hunan provincial elections. Candidates will need to announce themselves to run, and the people will be allowed to choose between them, depending on how they would like Hunan to be run and under what sort of governorship. All Hunanese can run, but not many are actually interested in politics. It is also suspected by many that Zhao Hengti has some tricks up his sleeve regarding the elections..."
hnn.5.a:0 "A Victory for Constitutionalism!"

hnn.6.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Returns to Hunan"
hnn.6.d:0 "The Buddhist General, Tang Shengzhi, former governor of Hunan, has returned to the province today. After hearing about the constitution being restored, the Buddhist General decided to pack up his bags and move back from Hong Kong to Hunan. With the help of his brother, General Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi is temporarily staying in an inn in Changsha. He has not done anything yet, but many beleive the former governor to have come back to run for governor. Indeed, he is quite popular within the military and the general populace for his 'Revolutionary Socialism' and Buddhisisation policies, and if he were to run, he would prove quite the threat to Zhao Hengti's reign."
hnn.6.a:0 "What might he be planning to do?"

hnn.7.t:0 "Cheng Qian Leaves For Hunan"
hnn.7.d:0 "General Cheng Qian, orginally from Hunan expressed a desire to contest that country's newly announced general elections. He was given the go-ahead for his plan and has now left for Hunan."
hnn.7.a:0 "Hopefully he finds success."

hnn.8.t:0 "Cheng Qian Returns To Hunan"
hnn.8.d_1:0 "While the nationalist revolt in Longyang was crushed, Cheng Qian, an old KMT aggitator from our province, managed to escape with his life. He has now returned to Hunan and announced his ambition for the Presidency. While he presently lacks a wide base of support, circumstances may allow him to build one, especially among the urban poor."
hnn.8.d_2:0 "Cheng Qian, an old KMT aggitator from our province, has returned to Hunan and announced his ambition for the Presidency. While he presently lacks a wide base of support, circumstances may allow him to build one, especially among the urban poor."
hnn.8.a:0 "He will not win."

hnn.9.t:0 "Zhao Hengti In Hengyang"
hnn.9.d:0 "Two days ago, Governor Zhao Hengti returned to his home city of Hengyang, in the hopes that he would convince the people from his hometown to vote for him. He visited his family along with old childhood friends, and made multiple speeches around the city, gathering the attention of many people. However, his countrymen were indifferent to him, and when the Governor slipped during his speech, the reaction to his presence was openly hostile. He was booed and insulted. It seems that the population of Hengyang has turned to the alternative candidates..."
hnn.9.a:0 "The people turn to Tang"
hnn.9.b:0 "The people turn to Cheng"

hnn.10.t:0 "Zhao Regroups"
hnn.10.d:0 "After being skewered in his hometown, Zhao Hengti has taken a few days off from campaigning to establish a new strategy with his advisors."
hnn.10.a:0 "Hopefully he finds his footing."

hnn.11.t:0 "Campaign in Yiyang"
hnn.11.d:0 "Cheng Qian has found support in the city of Yiyang and the surrounding region. In a rousing speech, he stressed his humble origins and desire for Hunan to stand on its own two feet potentially separate even from the KMT in Longyang. Zhao Hengti and Tang Shengzhi have attempted to respond to this surge in support for Cheng in the area. Who shall ultimate be the city's favored candidate?"
hnn.11.a:0 "Zhao Hengti"
hnn.11.b:0 "Tang Shengzhi"
hnn.11.c:0 "Cheng Qian"

hnn.12.t:0 "Electoral Battle For Changde"
hnn.12.d:0 "Tang Shengzhi chose to begin his campaign in Changde, and has made steady headway in that important city. Recently, however, controversy has errupted in the city over Tang's actions during the Constitution Protection Movement. If the flames of this controversy were to be flamed, Tang could lose the city."
hnn.12.a:0 "Zhao Hengti fans the flames."
hnn.12.b:0 "Tang Shengzhi hold on."
hnn.12.c:0 "Cheng Qian fans the flames."

hnn.13.t:0 "Down To The Countryside"
hnn.13.d:0 "Through the efforts of Tang Shengzhi's brother, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi has redoubled his support in the countryside, particularly the highly populous the countryside around Changsha. Unwilling to cede the peasantry, the vast majority of the population though not a particularly politicized group, Zhao Hengti and Cheng Qian have also gone down to the countryside to campaign. Who finds the greatest support?"
hnn.13.a:0 "Zhao Hengti"
hnn.13.b:0 "Tang Shengzhi"
hnn.13.c:0 "Cheng Qian"

hnn.14.t:0 "Changsha Incident"
hnn.14.d:0 "Angered by Tang Shengzhi's land policies during his governorship and the apathy of Zhao Hengti, a group of intermediaries from the small backwater of Changsha havve started an uproar which is now reverberating throughout the countryside. They demand that whatever may come, actually bring grains and cash crops grown by large estates to market which has long been seen as immoral, be given state recognition. Because many of these intermediaries themselves also run large farms stocked with hired laborers, their impact has been particularly large."
hnn.14.a:0 "Zhao Hengti promises them what they want."
hnn.14.b:0 "Tang Shengzhi agrees to incorporate them into his land reform policies."
hnn.14.c:0 "Cheng Qian promises them what they want."

hnn.15.t:0 "The Slums Of Changsha"
hnn.15.d:0 "Changsha has grown greatly in recent years, spurred by economic change and the beginnings of industrialisation, especially as many peasants have sought protection from campaigns which have ravaged their billages. The shanties on the edge of the city have become substantial, and while considered a blight their residents must at least be pandered to if the illusion of universal male suffrage is to be maintained. Who best appeals to them?"
hnn.15.a:0 "Zhao Hengti"
hnn.15.b:0 "Tang Shengzhi"
hnn.15.c:0 "Cheng Qian"

hnn.17.t:0 "The Voting Begins"
hnn.17.d:0 "It is time for the people of Hunan to cast their votes as to who they think should lead the province. People from all over Hunan now gather at voting booths to cast their vote into the ballot, and Hunan will see the democratic dream of Zhao Hengti come true."
hnn.17.a:0 "A new chapter in our history begins..."

#hnn.18 removed

hnn.19.t:0 "The Governor"
hnn.19.d:0 "There has been a shocking turn of events as Zhao Hengti has stripped the province of Hunan of most of its legal procedures. He has rebounded on his promises of elections for governorship. The cries of the people were not heard, and Zhao promises prosperity and a new Hunan."
hnn.19.a:0 "Long live the Governor!"

hnn.20.t:0 "Protests in Changsha"
hnn.20.d:0 "On the streets of Changsha, the sky clouded by mist, one could barely see past the mountains and seas of people protesting. One could barely hear across the noise they were making. It was clear that the people were not for the new policies of the governor, and are calling out for a return of democracy to the province.\n\nZhao Hengti, however, has remained calm, lounging in his office chair all day, sending more and more guards out to crack down on the protestors."
hnn.20.a:0 "So this is how democracy dies..."

hnn.21.t:0 "Wu Peifu Supports Us"
hnn.21.d:0 "In the North, Marshal Wu Peif has sent a letter to us, promising to help us in our cause and to help Zhao Hengti. With the Hunan-Hubei border becoming ever so militarized, it seems as if Wu Peifu will retaliate to the anti-Zhao Hengti protests with force if they get too out of hand."
hnn.21.a:0 "In times of need, we need a helping hand."

hnn.22.t:0 "The Buddhist General Returns"
hnn.22.d:0 "Amidst the rising tensions between the people and the Governor, General Tang Shengming managed to bring back his brother from Guizhou, where he was hiding in a small mountain village. Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General, entered Changsha today, his face instantly recognizable by the local citizens from his Buddhisisation propaganda back when he was a governor. He became a topic of hot debate overnight, with family dinners interrupted by provincial politics.\n\nHe is currently staying at his brother's residence in Changsha, and rumors have been circulating about a potential plot to restore him to power."
hnn.22.a:0 "What plans does he have going on in his mind?"

hnn.23.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Speaks Out"
hnn.23.d:0 "The recently returned General Tang Shengzhi has spoken out against the revoking of the Provincial Constitution, calling it un-democratic and a betrayal of the province and her people. Along with his brother, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi has been incredibly vocal about Zhao Hengti and his actions. It is even suspected that the General has sent spies to sabotage the acts of the Governor."
hnn.23.a:0 "He is nothing but trouble..."

hnn.24.t:0 "Assassination Attempt on the Governor!"
hnn.24.d:0 "As the assassin entered the room, clutching the pistol in his pocket, he knew that he had two options - to succeed, or to fail. His comrades would have told him that he could step back and turn away at any moment, that he still had a long life to live. But the decision had already been made. There was no turning back.\n\nZhao Hengti must die."
hnn.24.a:0 "It's time."

hnn.25.t:0 "Failed Assassination of Zhao Hengti!"
hnn.25.d:0 "The assassin's dead body was burned this morning. No one knew who he was, and no one cared for him. He had died, four shots in his chest, the blood long dried up.\n\nGovernor Zhao went up to the podium to deliver a speech today. He has shockingly had an attempt on his life performed on him, but he valiantly fought the assassin, killing him. He has displayed the assassin's body as a threat to all those who dare to oppose him."
hnn.25.a:0 "How could someone do this to our governor?"

hnn.26.t:0 "The Military Flocks to Tang Shengzhi"
hnn.26.d:0 "As a very popular figure in the military, the Buddhist General Tang Shengzhi has garnered much support amongst the divisions of Hunan, riling up many generals and corporals to take his side. It seems that a military resistance is building, one that may threaten Zhao Hengti's rule over Hunan."
hnn.26.a:0 "Troubling..."

hnn.27.t:0 "Pro-Constitutional Protests Escalate"
hnn.27.d:0 "More protests have been springing up over the province lately, with the local people very much angry at the constitution being teared up and revoked. There was a large protest in front of the Hunan Provincial Council building yet again today, and another one in Hengyang a few days ago. Over time, these protests have become much bigger and louder, gathering many people each day. Some have reported even seeing Pro-Tang Shengzhi banners being used in the protests."
hnn.27.a:0 "Are they really that angry about some useless paper?"

hnn.28.t:0 "Riots Break Out"
hnn.28.d:0 "A riot occurred today in Changsha. It started as a normal protest, but after a spat between a Constitutionalist and a Provincial Council member escalated too far, a full-on riot broke out, with people punching in the air. The local army was sent in, managing to push back the rioters down the streets and putting an end to the temporary chaos."
hnn.28.a:0 "Damn it, we need to keep this under control!"

hnn.29.t:0 "Violence in the Streets"
hnn.29.d:0 "Changde and Changsha were hit with another wave of protests this week, with one of them ending bloodily. A guard opened fire on the protestors in Changde, prompting the crowd to go wild and an almost full-blown battle to be fought between the rioters and the guards, resulting in casualties on both sides. Over the past week, protests have become increasingly violent, resulting in serious injuries and even deaths in some cases. With each passing day, it becomes harder to restore order to the province and stop the people from protesting."
hnn.29.a:0 "The Yuanjiang River runs red today..."

hnn.30.t:0 "The Military Revolts!"
hnn.30.d:0 "This morning, under the banner of the Buddhist General, much of our military has declared a revolt! They have set their provisional capital in Changde, and the forces loyal to Zhao Hengti are beginning to flock to the front lines. Major battles are predicted to start shortly, and the province is plunged into chaos."
hnn.30.a:0 "This isn't good..."

hnn.31.t:0 "The Battle of Fenghuang"
hnn.31.d:0 "The city of Fenghuang, next to the eastern border of Guizhou, is the site of an ongoing battle between the two sides. Zhao Hengti's militia has entered the city, guns blazing, while the soldiers loyal to Tang Shengzhi have held up a valiant defence."
hnn.31.a:0 "Tang Shengzhi's defence succeeds!"
hnn.31.b:0 "Zhao Hengti takes over the city!"

hnn.32.t:0 "The Battle of Changsha"
hnn.32.d:0 "After the victory of the rebels at Fenghuang, they have moved in to attempt and take Changsha, Zhao Hengti's base. The city has been in chaos for days as the rebels romp through the streets, getting closer and closer to the provincial governor's house. The air is tense, and the ground is stained in blood. If the rebels win, this might mean an end to Zhao Hengti's governorship."
hnn.32.a:0 "The Rebels win!"
hnn.32.b:0 "The Loyalists push the Rebels out!"

hnn.33.t:0 "The Battle of Changde"
hnn.33.d:0 "After Zhao Hengti's pyrrhic victory at Fenghuang, he has gathered up his confidence and his troops yet again, this time to strike at the heart of the rebellion - Changde. A series of skirmishes and battles have already happened, and the sound of artillery fills the air. The rebels could quite possibly be defeated today."
hnn.33.a:0 "Tang defends the city!"
hnn.33.b:0 "Zhao rolls in!"

hnn.34.t:0 "The Battle of Hengyang"
hnn.34.d:0 "After a series of close battles and an unsuccessful attempt to take the capital of a side, the revolt is in its last stages. The two sides have finally met with their full forces in the city of Hengyang, the birthplace of Zhao Hengti. With their divisions amassed, this might as well be the final battlefield of the revolt.

hnn.36.t:0 "The Battle of Yiyang"
hnn.36.d:0 "An important junction between the two cities of Changsha and Changde, the bases of Zhao Hengti and Tang Shengzhi, respectively, Yiyang has been attacked by the rebels. Tang Shengzhi and a few divisions have come near the city and are currently bombarding the loyalist defenses. Zhao Hengti, hearing these news, has quickly commanded his generals to send a relief force. But, there are fears that the force will not arrive in time, and that Tang Shengzhi will take over the city, making him one step closer to Changsha."
hnn.36.a:0 "Tang breaks the defenses!"
hnn.36.b:0 "The reinforcements arrive!"

hnn.37.t:0 "The Battle of Shaoyang"
hnn.37.d:0 "Shaoyang, a city in the middle of Hunan, has come under attack by the Buddhist General's forces. From Shaoyang, Tang could possibly expand his power to the city of Hengyang and capture Southern Hunan, severing our connections with Liangguang and cornering us in the North. He may also gain control of important roads leading to important cities such as Changsha. It is imperative that Zhao Hengti keep the city if he wishes to survive."
hnn.37.a:0 "Tang kicks the loyalists out!"
hnn.37.b:0 "Zhao routes the rebels!"

hnn.38.t:0 "An Attack at Huaihua"
hnn.38.d:0 "Huaihua, a city in Western Hunan, is currently under the control of the Buddhist General Tang Shengzhi. A force has been sent by the Governor to potentially break the front and capture the city of Huaihua, which could be used as a point to stage an attack on Changde and the North and cut off the Buddhist General's forces in the South. The city is well-defended, and the battle is close. Who will win?"
hnn.38.a:0 "The attack fails!"
hnn.38.b:0 "The attack succeeds!"

hnn.39.t:0 "Across Dongting Lake"
hnn.39.d:0 "Dongting Lake is a large lake in the North of Hunan, after which Hunan is named for (south of the lake). If we are able to cross it, it may provide us with a huge tactical advantage over the rebels and take us closer to Changde. Boats are to be built and sent out into the lake to contest the current dominance by Tang Shengzhi. The objective is to secure coastal villages and hold out."
hnn.39.a:0 "We will capture this lake!"

hnn.40.t:0 "Up the Yuanjiang River"
hnn.40.d:0 "The Yuanjiang is a river that flows from Dongting Lake and through Changde. Now that we have sufficient dominance over the lake, we are to strike up the river. Our men have been loaded onto boats with the objective of raiding riverside settlements and with the eventual goal of creating chaos in Changde and returning to Changsha."
hnn.40.a:0 "Good luck."

hnn.41.t:0 "A Raid on Changde"
hnn.41.d:0 "Success! Our men have gone up the river and raided Changde, taking with them valuable documents, intelligence, and money. Many good men were lost, but the ones who escaped have brought us an invaluable advantage."
hnn.41.a:0 "A great success!"

hnn.42.t:0 "A Failed Raid"
hnn.42.d:0 "Ou men have been captured and gunned down by the Buddhist General's forces in Changde. It seems they were expecting an attack up the river, and they sprung a trap, encircling the soldiers and forcing them to surrender."
hnn.42.a:0 "You were the chosen ones!"

hnn.43.t:0 "A Suspected Plot"
hnn.43.d:0 "Military officers were overheard during their conversations today, talking about a plot to potentially overthrow the Governor. When news arrived at the Governor's office, he merely nodded and said that he had been expecting such a thing to happen. The Provincial Government has been told not to worry, although fears are brewing that the Governor has underestimated the threat..."
hnn.43.a:0 "It'll be fine... Right?"

hnn.44.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Denounces Zhao Hengti"
hnn.44.d:0 "The Buddhist General has once again spoken out, now with much fiercer anger against the Governor. He came onto a balcony in Changde with thousands of people watching him as he listed the many things he accused the current provincial government of. He was seen flanked by his brother, Tang Shengming, among other members of the military. Many concerns have been raised that the general has connections with the plot against Zhao Hengti."

hnn.45.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Wins The Election"
hnn.45.d:0 "Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General, has won the provinicial election, and become Hunan's governor, the de-facto head of state."
hnn.45.a:0 "Victory!"

HNN_zhao_flees:0 "§HZhao Hengti§! becomes a general"

hnn.46.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Takes Over Hunan"
hnn.46.d:0 "Tang Shengzhi has, once again, established full control over the province of Hunan. Earlier today, Tang Shengzhi and his men entered the Governor's house and ousted him from his position, installing Tang as the new governor. Zhao Hengti was reported to have fled across the provincial border to Hubei, a province under Northern Zhili control. Tang Shengzhi has started his spreading of 'Buddhist Socialism', and Hunan will see a new age, better or worse, under Tang Shengzhi. For now, we must see what he does."
hnn.46.a:0 "The Governor is gone, long live the new Governor!"

hnn.47.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi's Revolutionary Buddhism"
hnn.47.d:0 "The new governor, Tang Shengzhi, has put forth his new ideology into Hunanese society once again. Calling it 'Revolutionary Buddhism', Governor Tang seeks to combine the best parts of many ideologies. He takes his inspiration from the Kuomintang socialists and their message of equality, from the National Protection Alliance and their patriotism, from the ideologies of the Third Internationale, and from the Buddhism of himself and his comrades. Tang Shengzhi combines all these elements to create his perfect new ideology.\n\nEven though some devout Buddhists and right-wingers are opposed to it, many in Hunan accept it, as they believe that it is the right way forward for the modernization of the province. In order for Hunan to step upon the stage of China again, she must first revolutionize."
hnn.47.a:0 "For Buddhism! For Revolution!"

hnn.48.t:0 "The Landlord Problem"
hnn.48.d:0 "There is quite a contentious problem in Hunan - the problem of what to do with our landlords. As Tang Shengzhi is a socialist, he must know how to deal with them effectively. There are three ways to deal with them - to kill them, to give them hard labor ten times the work of an ordinary farmer, or to set them free and tell them to not come back again. Which should the general choose?"
hnn.48.a:0 "Kill them!"
hnn.48.b:0 "Make them work!"
hnn.48.c:0 "Set them free!"

hnn.49.t:0 "The Question of Women"
hnn.49.d:0 "Women constitute a large part of our population. Most adult women in Hunan are simple farmers or housewifes, and do not have any say. However, influential women have begun to push their agenda, to have them working more in factories in big cities and to help women raise their statuses. Their demands are to have women be equal to men in work and pay, and for discrimination against females to be wiped out. However, there has been much opposition from the provincial council and the local men, as they do not wish to give up a large part of their power to women. They want to keep their positions and their male social and economic superiority as best they can. If we promise equality, it will be good for women, but it is a surefire way to anger the men of Hunan. How do we respond?"
hnn.49.a:0 "Social and economic equality now!"
hnn.49.b:0 "Promise to elevate the status of women"
hnn.49.c:0 "Back to the kitchen, fools."

hnn.50.t:0 "Founding of Yaoxiang Academy"
hnn.50.d:0 "Today, near his home county of Dong'an, Tang Shengzhi announced that he would be opening a new secondary school, named the Yaoxiang Academy after his father. The academy, initially intended to be a university, will not have a board of directors, and Tang Shengzhi will be the chairman of the school, with Gu Chou as the principal. The Yaoxiang Academy, being a private school, is aimed at educating relatively wealthy teenagers. The academy has no specific focus, and it will open in the next year."
hnn.50.a:0 "A noteworthy effort to improve education!"

hnn.51.t:0 "Protests from Monasteries"
hnn.51.d:0 "Some Buddhist monasteries in Hunan have expressed outrage at Tang Shengzhi's new Buddhisisation program, claiming that it took away their way of life and adapted their religion to a harmful political agenda. Tang Shengzhi responded to these monks by saying 'Buddhism is nothing without socialism or politics. If you're concerned about politics being involved in religion, you should look at the Western provinces.'"
hnn.51.a:0 "They probably didn't like that response..."

hnn.52.t:0 "Military Rent Collectors"
hnn.52.d:0 "It has come to the attention of the Provincial Government of Hunan that local landlords have been hiring members of the military to collect rent and evict their tenants for a cut of the rent money. This goes without saying as a severe transgression against the ideals of Buddhist Socialism, and with unanimous agreement from the Provincial Council, the military is to be told to stand down and stop its interference with landowners."
hnn.52.a:0 "These pesky landlords are up to no good!"

hnn.53.t:0 "Military Rent Collectors Stand Down"
hnn.53.d:0 "With the order coming through from Changsha that all members of the military who engaged in the collecting of rent and eviction of tenants to cease their actions, most of the military personnel who engaged in rent collection stopped. They were either demoted or punished, and those who refused the order were stripped of their rank and arrested."
hnn.53.a:0 "People will do anything for a little money..."

hnn.54.t:0 "Reports on Arms Smuggling"
hnn.54.d:0 "The North-South railway going through Hunan is being used extensively for the transport of cargo, and among it, weapons. These weapons are transported illegally to and from Guangxi, Guangdong, the Foreign Concessions, and the government in Beijing. There is now hot debate in the Provincial Council as to what to do with these illegal arms smugglers. Many members have stated that they do not care about the situation, and some urge governor Tang Shengzhi to take action immediately and crack down on the smugglers. The choice is ultimately his - what do we do with the illegal arms trade?"
hnn.54.a:0 "Starting with the next cargo train that passes through, we must crack down on this at once!"
hnn.54.b:0 "Leave them be, as long as they pay the transport fee they'll be fine."

hnn.55.t:0 "The Xiangjiang Incident"
hnn.55.d:0 "Local reports of suspicious boats on the Xiangjiang were never a matter of importance to the police. However, after a large gunfight in Changde, leaving around a dozen dead and many more wounded involving these boats, the local police force has started to investigate more into these strange barges. Many say that the boats are just regular ones, and that the participants of the gunfight should be apprehended, but some claim that the gunfight and the marked boats are examples of something bigger."
hnn.55.a:0 "I'm sure it's nothing - arrest the troublesome ones and we'll be done with this."
hnn.55.b:0 "This calls for an investigation!"

hnn.56.t:0 "Massive Opium Smuggling Ring Discovered"
hnn.56.d:0 "The investigation of the strange, marked boats and the gunfight on the Xiangjiang River have led to the discovery of a massive illegal opium smuggling ring which has operated under the nose of the Provincial Government for years. Even though the Provincial Government does not care much about the use of opium, the fact that this smuggling ring has continuously avoided taxation has made the Provincial Government agree that this smuggling ring should be stopped. Operating within Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan, this ring is notorious for running from the law and defying local authority."
hnn.56.a:0 "This must be put to an end at once!"

hnn.57.t:0 "Yiguandao Rally"
hnn.57.d:0 "A recent rural Yiguandao rally has turned the public eye to this strange religion. With an old 'Master' holding the rally, members of the Yiguandao tried to spread the word of the Yiguandao across the countryside of Hunan. The cult has been rejected by many farmers and peasants as crazy, but many other also started becoming devout followers. There is now hot debate about the Yiguandao and its possible effects on the province, with many citing the Yiguandao in Shandong, where they are perhaps one of the most powerful forces in the province."
hnn.57.a:0 "This cult is a strange one."

hnn.58.t:0 "Opium Smuggling Ring Discovered in Southern China"
hnn.58.d:0 "An illegal opium smuggling ring has just been discovered by the provincial government of Hunan. They have operated under the noses of the governors of Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and eastern provinces along the Yangtze for many years, consistently evading taxation. Governor Tang Shengzhi of Hunan has dedicated himself in the past week to destroy this smuggling ring, or at least to make it pay taxes. Whatever the case, ceasing the evasion of taxes by thsi group will help us financially."
hnn.58.a:0 "Good work, Tang!"

#Zhao Authoritarian Events

hnn.59.t:0 "Zhao Hengti Wins The Election Through Fraud"
hnn.59.d:0 "The election was so deeply fraudulent that the results were all but discarded. Zhao Hengti has been re-elected on flimsy grounds. While Tang Shengzhi and Cheng Qian may protest, the duration of the election gave Zhao Hengti sufficient time to cement his rule. Tang Shengzhi, worringly, has fled from the province with some of his closest advisors in tow."
hnn.59.a:0 "Victory!"

hnn.590.t:0 "Zhao Hengti Puts Down the Rebellion"
hnn.590.d:0 "Zhao Hengti and his men have walked into Changde, ousting Tang Shengzhi and the generals loyal to him, most, if not all of which have fled on train to neighboring Sichuan, where they will lie low amidst the chaos. The rebellion is over, and Tang Shengzhi has fled from the province. The Governor has called a great feast to be held tonight, with his loyalist generals, to celebrate the end of the hard-fought but short rebellion. A new age will begin for Hunan under Governor Zhao Hengti."
hnn.590.a:0 "He's gone for good this time."

hnn.60.t:0 "The Hunt For Tang Shengzhi"
hnn.60.d:0 "The initial search for Tang Shengzhi has failed to turn up any leads. The team responsible for the search has begun to look further afield. It might be a while but surely we will find the traitor and bring him to trial."
hnn.60.a:0 "Let's hope he hasn't fled too far."

hnn.61.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Found in Hong Kong"
hnn.61.d:0 "After two months of searching, Tang Shengzhi has been identified in Hong Kong. A team has been assembled to drag him back to Hunan in chains."
hnn.61.a:0 "Bring him back, and we will put him on trial."

hnn.62.t:0 "The Trial of Tang Shengzhi"
hnn.62.d:0 "While two of our men were shot in Hong Kong in the process, Tang Shengzhi has been brought back to Hunan in chains. A show trial has been prepared and he stands accused of treason. While our rule is secure, Tang Shengzhi remains popular and executing him might leave a number of people quite upset."
hnn.62.a:0 "Death to the traitor!"

#Zhao Democratic Events

hnn.63.t:0 "Zhao Hengti Wins The Election"
hnn.63.d_1:0 "While the voting was extremely close, in the end, Zhao Hengti won by a narrow margin. While some whisper that it was fraud which pushed him over the edge, throughout the election, Zhao was uncharacteristically restrained, and given time to cement his regime, none can openly challenge Zhao in the field."
hnn.63.d_2:0 "While many expected Zhao Hengti to fraudulently affect the results of the Hunanese general election, by all accounts the election was mostly free and fair. Zhao has been re-elected governor nonetheless."
hnn.63.a:0 "Victory!"

#KMT Events

hnn.64.t:0 "Cheng Qian Wins The Election"
hnn.64.d:0 "Cheng Qian and the KMT have won the election. Not willing to wait to assume the governorship, Cheng Qian all but chased Zhao Hengti from his residence. While many expect Cheng to bring Hunan under arms in support of the KMT in Longyang, he possesses a notorious independent streak."
hnn.64.a:0 "Victory!"

hnn.65.t:0 "A Path for Hunan"
hnn.65.d1:0 "With our victory secure, we must choose whether to align with the left or the less prominent right."
hnn.65.d2:0 "The attempted Nationalist revolt in Longyang unfortunately failed before our rise to power in Hunan. With our victory secure, we must choose whether to align with the left or the less prominent right."
hnn.65.a:0 "Conform to the party line."
hnn.65.b:0 "Our own path - align with the right of the party."

hnn.650.t:0 "Hunan Aligns With The Right"
hnn.650.d:0 "While Cheng Qian only recently was a leading member of our party, following his victory in Hunan, he has officially proclaimed his desire to align with the discredited right. While perhaps some sort of arrangement may still yet be made between us, many see this as a betrayal."
hnn.650.a:0 "A Betrayal."

#Foreign Policy Events

hnn.66.d_1:0 "Hunan has expressed interest in joining the National Protection Alliance, but has reservations. As a small province, Hunan fear that should other Chinese factions be overcome, we may turn against them for our own gain. While it would simply be a gentleman's agreement, Hunan requests our leader publicly renounce any and all ambitions towards their province. Man to man, Tang Shengzhi, Hunan's governor, has also made an off demand - he seeks that we declare war upon the Zhili Clique within the next half year."

hnn.69.t:0 "Hunan Tentatively Seeks To Join Our Faction"
hnn.69.d:0 "Zhao Hengti was onced a close ally of Chen Jiongming. However, domestic politics in Hunan and his mutual friendships with Wu Peifu have pushed him firmly into our camp recently. As such, seeking protection, Hunan desires to formally link their fate with ours, however, they desire a guarantee. Zhao's request is simple, we shall never remove Zhao Hengti himself as provincial governor, come what may."
hnn.69.a:0 "Agree to the deal."

hnn.70.t:0 "A Proposal From Hunan"
hnn.70.d:0 "Hunan, drawing on old connections to the Federalist movement, has requested to join our alliance. Zhao Hengti, however, is not the same man he once was.

Though some are hesitant given Tang's frequent clashes with the nationalist general Cheng Qian, largely, members of our government are sympathetic to Tang. Man to man, Tang Shengzhi, Hunan's governor, has also made a specific demand - he seeks that we declare war upon the Zhili Clique within the next half year. Though not surprising given his old animosity with Wu Peifu, making such a commitment could prove troublesome for us."

hnn.85.d:0 "Our war against the [GXCHNN_enemy.GetName] will be quite an uphill battle. In desperation, despite the objections of his closest advisors, especially He Jian, Zhao Hengti has mulled over the idea of seeking intervention by the Federalists to the South. Though Zhao's personal ties to Chen Jiongming are not as strong as they once were, Zhao is confident that he can secure he and his people's continued governance of Hunan within Chen Jiongming's state."

hnn.86.t:0 "A Request From Zhao Hengti"
hnn.86.d:0 "In desperation in the face of a seemingly unwinnable war, Hunan's governor, Zhao Hengti, has approached Chen Jiongming directly for assistance. An old acquiantance of Chen's, and also a proponent of a federal China, Zhao has proposed the integration of his province into our regime. As Zhao also has connections to other factions, some of our staff suggest taking this deal, before Zhao aligns himself against us for personal gain. Others, however, believe that Zhao's price is too high - entering his war to protect Hunan now, and granting Hunan autonomy within our state, beyond that of other provinces. Reading the fine print, such would essentially perpetually secure Zhao's place as governor of Hunan within our nation."
hnn.86.a:0 "A fair proposition."

hnn.860.d_2:0 "Zhao Hengti, an old friend of Chen Jiongming's has come under attack from a vastly superior foe.

hnn.97.t:0 "The Economy of Hunan"
hnn.97.d:0 "Even though Black Monday did little to affect the inland provinces, Hunan was still hit by it. There was a significant economic downurn overnight, but not anything to destroy the economy. Hunan has been in a rather stable position for years now, with a relatively weak economy amongst the other Chiense provinces. Our main exports are rhubarb, musk, honey, tobacco, hemp, and birds, and we are an important producer of tea and ramie, both of which, under the League of Eight Provinces, were sold to the concessions. The province must now use its abilities to improve our economy, do business with other powers in China, and set our province on the right path."
hnn.97.a:0 "We must aim for a better economy."

hnn.98.t:0 "Economic Woes Gone"

hnn.102.t:0 "Constitution Day"
hnn.102.d:0 "Today is the anniversary of the restoration of the Hunan constitution. During the time the Constitution has been reimplemented, it has seemingly successfully protected the citizens of Hunan from too much corruption and misconduct, and Hunan's democratic experiment has worked well."

hnn.104.t:0 "'Entry No. 192 - Another Day in Changsha'"
hnn.104.d:0 "'They say the Buddhist General has returned. I do not care about this, or Zhao Hengti, or anything. This is all just nonsense - I just want to protect my family without the fear of those protestors barging into my house. Hell, prices are rising fast from the collapse, and no one wants me to sharpen their blades anymore. I hate this - I am going to go north and move to Wuchang with what money I have left.'"
hnn.104.a:0 "'Life is hard these days.'"

hnn.105.t:0 "He Jian Bans Alice in Wonderland"
hnn.105.d:0 "General He Jian, the censor of Hunan under Zhao Hengti, has issued a unilateral ban over the book 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', by author Lewis Carroll. He claims that the book's portrayal of anthropomorphized animals acting with no difference other than physically than human beings was an insult to the humanity. He further explains that children, when seeing humans and animals on the same level as each other, will start to regard them as so, something he described as having 'disastrous' consequences.\n\nSoldiers were commanded to throw away and burn any copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland they saw. Across the province, his action has been seen very poorly by local parents and children."
hnn.105.a:0 "He has a point."
hnn.105.b:0 "It's just a children's book, reverse the ban."
