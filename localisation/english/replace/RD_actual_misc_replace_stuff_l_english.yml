####replace means another file on the kx mod has a localization entry that you want to change without copying over the entire fucking file. Paradox isn't stupid enough to make you copy that entire file over 
#prc base names to replace the boring kx ones in country names file actually, you could have also made a cosmetic tag with names and given that to prc. copying large files that we have to keep up is a last ditch effort

LOADING_TIP_221:0 "We are depending on the younger men. The students in the towns and barrios. They are intelligent enough to understand our platform, to explain it to the voters of their towns. You know how it is in the provinces. Whenever a man cannot understand something, he sends for the town student to explain it to him. These are the men on whom the opposition builds its hopes.\n- Juan Sumulong"
LOADING_TIP_219:0 "Although counter-revolutionary forces are very powerful, the Kuomintang and the Chinese Syndicalist Party are cooperating and we have the support of the people of the whole country.\n- Chiang Kai-shek"
LOADING_TIP_215:0 "According to the courtesy of ‘gifts ought to be exchanged,’ disorder should be transported from China to Europe and all the imperialist states.\n- Li Dazhao"
LOADING_TIP_197:0 "I'm so used to eating that I can finish a fat goose in one meal. Although there are only a few people in the family, each meal costs $10! It's so hard to live like Mr. Sun.\n- Tang Shaoyi"
LOADING_TIP_196:0 "The decadence of the state, the sufferings of humanity, and the darkness of society have all reached an extreme. Where is the method of improvement and reform? Education, industrialization, strenuous efforts, rapid progress, destruction and construction are, to be sure, all right, but there is a basic method for carrying out all these undertakings, which is that of the great union of the popular masses.\n- Mao Zedong"
LOADING_TIP_195:0 "The value of the individual is greater than that of the universe. Thus there is no greater crime than to suppress the individual… The churches, the capitalists, the monarchy, and the state constitute the four evil demons of the world… The group in itself has no meaning, it only has meaning as a collectivity of individuals.\n- Mao Zedong"

worldnews.413.d:0 "Few things are certain in the twisting labyrinth of Chinese politics, but even renowned political analysts have utterly failed to predict the rise of [FROM.GetLeader] from the one of the many provinces of China to the leader of the nation. Nevertheless, he has done it, and with Beijing and much of the North China Plain, under his rule, he has a base of operations, substantial enough, perhaps, to fully reunify all of China. Western nations have already recognized the new government of China, and any remaining Chinese cliques are undoubtedly preparing for a new assault on their power."
