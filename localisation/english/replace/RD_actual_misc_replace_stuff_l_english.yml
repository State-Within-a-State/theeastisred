####replace means another file on the kx mod has a localization entry that you want to change without copying over the entire fucking file. Paradox isn't stupid enough to make you copy that entire file over 
#prc base names to replace the boring kx ones in country names file actually, you could have also made a cosmetic tag with names and given that to prc. copying large files that we have to keep up is a last ditch effort

worldnews.413.d:0 "Few things are certain in the twisting labyrinth of Chinese politics, but even renowned political analysts have utterly failed to predict the rise of [FROM.GetLeader] from the one of the many provinces of China to the leader of the nation. Nevertheless, he has done it, and with Beijing and much of the North China Plain under his rule, as well as his heartland, he has a base of operations, substantial enough, perhaps, to fully reunify all of China. Western nations have already recognized the new government of China, and any remaining Chinese cliques are undoubtedly preparing for a new assault on their power."
worldnews.413.a:0 "The rest of China will soon be ours!"
worldnews.413.b:0 "We must prepare for a renewed onslaught."
worldnews.413.c:0 "Congratulations, [FROM.GetLeaderName]!"
