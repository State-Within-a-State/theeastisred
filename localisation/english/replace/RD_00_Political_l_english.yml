natpop_turanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Pan-Turanism)§!\n\nTuranism, also known as pan-Turanianism, pan-Turanism, or simply Turan, is a pseudoscientific pan-nationalist cultural and political movement proclaiming the need for close cooperation or political unification between people who are claimed by its supporters to be culturally, linguistically or ethnically related and to have Inner and Central Asian origin, such as the Turks, Mongols, Tungus, Hungarians, Finns, Estonians, Japanese and other smaller ethnic groups. It advocates for syncretic economic ideals, whilst being hyper nationalist on social issues."

authdem_sangkum_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sangkum)§!\n\nThe Sangkum Reastr Niyum(commonly known simply as the Sangkum)Central to the Sangkum ideology were nationalism, conservatism, preserving the monarchy, and a conservative interpretation of Buddhism. Despite its name, Sangkum's "Royal-Buddhist socialism" or "Khmer socialism" had little to do with socialism, neither with the Marxist variant nor with Anglo-Saxon "welfare socialism". Lacking a consistent political philosophy, it combined pseudo-socialist slogans with conservative social values, monarchism, nationalism and Theravada Buddhist teachings. It was stated that administrators would be 'socialists for the well-being of the people and royalists for the prestige and cohesion of the nation'. In power, the Sangkum functions according to principles of 'Buddhist socialism', a rather vague construct that while claiming to seek progressive goals and the end of social injustice, was based around the conservative religious and social traditions of Cambodia. Rather than doing away with private property, 'Buddhist socialism' encourages the wealthy to give to the poor in order to gain merit. In practice, economic management may develop as a form of 'crony socialism' analogous to crony capitalism, with state enterprises set up and then managed by members of the Sangkum elite, often for their own personal gain."

ikki_kita_thought_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Pure Socialism)§!\n\nPure Socialism, aka 'Ikki Kita Thought', is an ideology developed by Japan's leading Pan-Asianist Ikki Kita. The ideology seeks to unite Asia and potentially the world under a utopian socialist system led by Japan. Unlike Marxism, 'Pure Socialism' is not class-struggle orientated socialism, but rather a system looking at evolutionary theory by understanding the basic guidelines of societies and nations. In his beliefs Kita explicitly promotes the platonic state of authoritarianism, emphasizing the close relationship between Confucianism and the 'from above' concept of national socialism stating that Mencius is the Plato of the East and that Plato's concept of organizing a society is far preferable to Marx's."

Better known as Okawaism; It aims to create an anti-capitalist Japanese society that seeks to unite Asia into a single unitary state, under an socialist variant of social three-folding theory, with also a strong emphasis on the Emperor and the military. With a major idea being the inevitability of a 'clash of civilizations' between the East and West, in which he sees as Japan's right and goal to defend the East from western-imperialist-capitalists."

fukumotoism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Fukumotoism)§!\n\nFukumotoism is a Japanese Marxist ideology that developed from the internal split in the Japanese Communist Party between the Fukumoto and Yamakawa factions. Criticizing the eclecticism of Yamakawaism and other opportunistic trends willing to unite with anyone who puts on a progressive veneer, the Fukumotoists emphasize the importance of quality within the array of forces that make up the organization that is intended to be dedicated to revolution. A sectarian ideology, Fukumotoism is willing to "break away first before uniting" to make sure the vanguard of the proletariat can truly act as its representative. Individualist opportunists, moderate social democrats, and undecided sympathizers are wavering elements, unable to fully fight for the cause of proletarian liberation, thus harmful elements to absorb without an ideologically pure base. This ideological purity can also be seen in the emphasis placed on the "theoretical struggle" by Fukumotoists. Sound revolutionary theory is seen as of utmost importance to allow the party to understand correct policy and prevent potential mistakes, contrasted with the desire for action simply for action's sake that opportunist lines hold."

mao_zedong_thought_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Revolutionary Agrarianism)§!\n\nEver since the first humiliating treaty was thrust onto China, Chinese intellectuals and youth have searched for a way to bring China into modernity and regain its place in the world. Early Chinese revolutionary Marxists like Li Dazhao would see in the Russian Revolution an allegory for China's struggle to free itself from the western powers. Yet the revolution's failure in Russia would lessen its impact on Chinese society, with Syndicalism capturing the attention of many due to its success in western Europe. One Chinese intellectual who would turn away from anarchism and the desire for a "great union of the popular masses" and turn towards Marxism was Mao Zedong. The nature of Chinese Marxism has been heterodox, with progressive ideologies intermixing amongst the young intellectuals, which has allowed for the distinct beliefs of Revolutionary Agrarianism. In an article titled "Analysis of All the Classes in Chinese Society", written by Mao in late 1925, the unique analysis of the class character of Chinese society, which includes the view of the peasantry as a revolutionary class, was first documented. The ideology sees the 395 million of the petty bourgeoisie, the semiproletariat, and the proletariat as classes that are ultimately in favor of the revolution and can be mobilized for it against the barely 5 million class enemies of the revolution. This inclusion of classes that have been disregarded by both traditional Leninists and Syndicalists as allies shows a criticism by Mao against their strategies that are not adapted to the Chinese situation. Seeing the Chinese masses, including the 300 million peasants who have been neglected by traditional revolutionary strategy, as the only force capable of driving forwards history for China by ending the corrupt rule of the classes opposed to the revolution like the compradors and the big landlords, this democratic ideology seeks to create a new republican system run by and made up of a united front of all the revolutionary classes of the new China."

The failure of the revolution, the heavy repression of the victorious warlords, and perhaps the death of the dream of a strong China, had left many sympathizers of the revolution despondent. Yet despite these precarious circumstances, hope rebounded, and the men of letters eventually united. As the number one fiction writer in modern China, Lu Xun's support for such a project of unity against rightist authors was of absolute importance. This unity in the intellectual sphere was important, yet was stressed by Lu Xun as not enough to win in the battle of arms against reactionary forces. Lu Xun Thought is a nod to the greatest of the Chinese intellectual class sympathetic to the idea of a mass movement to bring about a new China free from the tyrannical warlords holding China back."

anarcho_tridemism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Anarcho-Tridemism)§!\n\nIn the course of Dr. Sun's struggle to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, many fellows were met and committed to the revolutionary cause. Anarchists too were part of this Revolutionary Alliance, influencing many up-and-coming radicals. Despite the part played by these anarchists in the Kuomintang, the Northern Expedition failed all the same. In the chaos of the assassination of Chiang Kai-shek, the influential anarchists of the Kuomintang eventually began working with the exiled Federalists of Chen Jiongming. This coalition has now come to an end with the anarchists having defeated Chen to seize power themselves. While this state of affairs may be exactly what radicals like Ba Jin may want, the Kuomintang-intertwined anarchists know that with the lack of proper education amongst the populace to support Anarchism, this struggle would be doomed to become another simply political revolution that would simply replace one government with another. Instead, the revolution that brings in anarchism holds at its fundamental core the education of the masses of China. Once morality, truth, and public-mindedness have transformed the behavior of the masses, only then will anarchism be successful. Such is the reason why the members of what once was the Four Elders refused to work with the Left split of the Kuomintang even despite the influence of other anarchism-inspired figures like Wang Jingwei on the Left Kuomintang. For their methods would only impoverish the working class through teaching obedience to authority. Instead, with the Right Kuomintang's support of progressive causes and its willingness to allow anarchist advocates to grow their own projects in Kuomintang-controlled territory, the anarchist movement embodied by the former Four Elders holds common cause with the nationalist party while the thousand-year universal revolution towards utopian society continues. Yet if such reconciliation turns out to be unachievable, anarchism will be capable of struggling on its own."

It aims to breifly restore a capitalist economy in order to 'build up' the nation toward a state the government can deem as able to transition into syndicalism. Though this is opposed by many syndicalists and has led many denoucing it as a false ideology. On also due to its restrictions on the masses in favour of the capitalist economics, most syndicalists regard pragmatic syndicalism as a capitalist ideological extension."

Running away to the lands of the western imperialists should have been enough to discredit them completely from the label of nationalist. Yet these cancers continue to fester and slander the late doctor's legacy with their claims of "combining" the Three Principles with their syndicalism, as seen in their reinterpretation of People's Livelihood as a form of class struggle.

Though the pathways to achieve and uphold these Three Pillars can change drastically based on the specific interpretation one comes to after digesting the late Sun Yat-sen’s works and ideas, all emulations of Tridemism seek to bring greater honor and glory to China, greater prosperity and freedom to the Chinese people, and a greater union between all aspects of Chinese society as the Three Pillars guide China to their modern and utopian destiny."
