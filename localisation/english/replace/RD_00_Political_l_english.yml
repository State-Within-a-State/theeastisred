national_populist_desc:0 "Reactionary"

### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

### SubIdeologies ###
#####################

### Names ###
authcom_subtype:0 "Marxism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Marxism)§!\n\nThe term 'Communism' is usually used to designate one of the main alternatives to orthodox French and English Syndicalism in the modern Socialist world. Developing from the writings and thoughts of Marx and Engels, the varied ideology - commonly called Marxism by its adherents to honor one of the most influential figures of human history and to distinguish it from other ideologies that lay claim to the word communism like Anarcho-Communism - is primarily defined by its materialistic analysis of the world. Marxists see the creation of modern bourgeois society out of fuedal society as the political form of the victory of the bourgeois class over the now irrelevant fuedal classes. This dominance was only possible due to the development of the means of production making incredible industrial production that swept away the inefficient guilds and nobles. With bourgeois control over society cemented, production has expanded under the bourgeois relations of property or free competition. As this expansion has occurred, a new class has been created and grows at the same rate as the growth of capital: the proletariat. This class does not own any capital and lives only if they can sell their labor power to an owner of capital. Their livelihood is dependent on the fluctuations of the market since if they cannot sell their labor power, they cannot eat. As bourgeois society advances, the middle classes like the small tradespeople or the handicraftsmen die out, either sinking into becoming proletarian or rising to the position of a bourgeoise. Thus, bourgeois society leads to two classes: the bourgeoise and the proletarian. With their class interests being directly opposed, the proletariat becomes more powerful and gains political consciousness due to commercial crisises and competition between the bourgeoise worsening working conditions. Once the proletariat feels confident in its strength and organization, it will end the current dictatorship of the bourgeoise and create a dictatorship of the proletariat. As the proletariat is defined by its lack of ownership of property, the proletariat cannot enforce its property relations to dominate society like former dominant classes did. Instead, it abolishes its own previous mode of appropriation at the hands of the bourgeoise, ending all class-antagonistic property forms. As the proletariat ends the bourgeois property forms, so to does it does it end the bourgeois class. In this way, proletarian victory means the abolishment of the proletariat class, class dictatorship and the state. So too does genuine full democracy become a habit and also wither away. The notions of "value" and "equality" are also done away with. Due to their understanding of such conditions, Marxists seek to bring the proletarian movement to its final victory. Though there are many tendencies within Marxism that may disagree, all Communists are united in their struggle to abolish the present state of things."

natpop_turanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Pan-Turanism)§!\n\nTuranism, also known as pan-Turanianism, pan-Turanism, or simply Turan, is a pseudoscientific pan-nationalist cultural and political movement proclaiming the need for close cooperation or political unification between people who are claimed by its supporters to be culturally, linguistically or ethnically related and to have Inner and Central Asian origin, such as the Turks, Mongols, Tungus, Hungarians, Finns, Estonians, Japanese and other smaller ethnic groups. It advocates for syncretic economic ideals, whilst being hyper nationalist on social issues."

Lacking a consistent political philosophy, it combined pseudo-socialist slogans with conservative social values, monarchism, nationalism and Theravada Buddhist teachings. It was stated that administrators would be 'socialists for the well-being of the people and royalists for the prestige and cohesion of the nation'.In power, the Sangkum functioned according to principles of 'Buddhist socialism', a rather vague construct that while claiming to seek progressive goals and the end of social injustice, was based around the conservative religious and social traditions of Cambodia. Rather than doing away with private property, 'Buddhist socialism' encouraged the wealthy to give to the poor in order to gain merit. In practice, economic management developed as a form of 'crony socialism' analogous to crony capitalism, state enterprises were set up and then managed by members of the Sangkum elite, often for their own personal gain."

In practice, economic management developed as a form of 'crony socialism' analogous to crony capitalism, state enterprises were set up and then managed by members of the Sangkum elite, often for their own personal gain."

The ideology seeks to unite Asia and potentially the world under a utopian socialist system led by Japan. Unlike Marxism, 'Pure Socialism' is not class-struggle orientated socialism, but rather a system looking at evolutionary theory by understanding the basic guidelines of societies and nations. In his beliefs Kita explicitly promotes the platonic state of authoritarianism, emphasizing the close relationship between Confucianism and the 'from above' concept of national socialism stating that Mencius is the Plato of the East and that Plato's concept of organizing a society is far preferable to Marx's."

Ba Jin's experiences with each of these ideologies has led him to promote a synthetic form of Anarchism. He incorporates the radical fury of anti-Confucian May Fourth sentiment and his own disenchantment with the family, traditional society and old learning with a deep faith in individualism. As such, Individualist Anarchism can be said to be a single child of many parents, eclectically incorporating such thinkers as Lu Xun, Max Stirner and Kropotkin into a uniquely Chinese ideology. Yet the ideology also works well with elitist vanguardism such as that promoted by Sun Yat-Sen himself, and calls for writers, artists and thinkers to devote their energies to spread a common creed of total liberation. Ba Jin has also toyed with deliberate use of new languages such as Esperanto to fully free Chinese society from its old ways, and has shown a willingness to use radical intellectual elites to break open the ‘iron cage’ of Chinese society - no matter the cost."

Anarcho-Buddhism hence promotes a uniquely Chinese and reformist-Buddhist take on anarchist organization - incorporating the principles of personal cultivation and a radical social responsibility to the commons into anarchist canons, this ideology inspires one to practice Bakunin by following the practice of Bodhisattvas and the land-sharing practices of monasteries. Shifu also called for the establishment of a ‘Western Heaven’ on Earth in his final years, a call that his disciples have not forgotten - and may one day put into practice."
