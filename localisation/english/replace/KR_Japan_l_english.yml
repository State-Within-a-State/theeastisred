 rework_japan.0.desc:0 "The fact that the Imperial Way Faction swept Japan seems to have caused a bit of trouble. "Yuzonsha" led by Kita Ikki is marching in Tokyo. There are two specific requirements from them. One is to implement a new system that combines socialism and monarchy. The other is to have Kita Ikki as the head of government and to crown Yasuhito as the new emperor. These demands are very ridiculous, but have some support within the Imperial Way Faction's army. How should we deal with this situation?"

An army was dispatched to suppress it, but this situation spread throughout the metropolitan area. There, an officer fired with a pistol, killing some Communists. The officer is a follower of "Yuzonsha" and states that he fired at the direction of Kita Ikki. Kita Ikki has denied that statement, and the situation will be even more serious."

Kita Ikki has stated that he supports these civil wars, and the situation has become even more serious. Although the troops have already been deployed, Japan may come to an end if this rebellion spreads throughout the country."

The Imperial Way Faction, once led solely by military personnel, was swept by Kita Ikki, members of "Yuzonsha" and the imperial family. Some socialists and nationalists joined the movement, and Japan was dominated by "national socialism." Kita Ikki has been appointed Prime Minister of Japan and has declared that he will bring a ray of light to Asia."

 #Desc
 superevents_numbers_1_desc:0 "A power struggle between the military and the government had been raging in Japan for months, but it was won by a few young officers and Kita Ikki. They were radical nationalists who tried to fuse socialist theory with the Emperor System, and their leader Kita Ikki, among others, advocated National Socialism and Asian solidarity. We should pay renewed attention to Japan's future developments."
 superevents_numbers_2_desc:0 "In a few days, the Japanese system has changed drastically. Nakano Seigō, several Tōhōkai members, and a small number of Ishin-ha generals took full control of Japan in a short period of time and seized the imperial capital. Immediate martial law mercilessly destroyed all resistance and evoked a totalism storm in East Asia."
