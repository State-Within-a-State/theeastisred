NISSHO_LEADER_DESC:0 "Inoue was born Inoue Shirō  in Kawaba, Gunma Prefecture, in 1887. He is the son of a rural doctor. Educated at Toyo Cooperative , he abandoned his studies and traveled to Manchuria where he spent time as a vagabond and ultimately found employment from 1909 to 1920 with the South Manchuria Railway. Upon his return to Japan, he first studied to become a Zen priest but then became a follower of Nichiren Buddhism, a conversion that led him to relocate to Miho, Shizuoka Prefecture, in order to study under the Nichiren scholar and nationalist preacher Tanaka Chigaku at the group called Kokuchukai. In 1928 he would form closer ties with the more militant factions of the Kokuchukai, constantly clashing the Giro Senoo's faction over the issue over Japanese imperial expansionism.  By 1931  Tanaka Chigaku is trying to balance the influence of Inoue's and Senoo's factions. Fortunately for  Inoue, he would befriend an upcoming general in the IJA, named Kanji Ishiwara. Now that Japan seems on the brink of collapsed caused by the ideas he is hated, Inoue prepares followers by arrange a coup led by Kanji Ishiwara."
GIRO_LEADER_DESC:0 "Giro Senoo was born in December 1889 in sake brewery, and he was not a Hokke believer, but Yoshiro became familiar with the Lotus Sutra at the recommendation of a tofu merchant he met while he was on leave from thigh school due to a lung infection . In 1918, he joined the Hokke corps unification group presided over by Nissei Honda . The following year, in 1919, he organized the Greater Japan Nichirenism Seinendan, centered on the youth followers of the Unification Dan, and actively engaged in publishing bulletins and giving lectures to various places. During his youth activities, he soon became involved in tenancy disputes and labor disputes, and began to advocate the necessity of social change. From 1918 Giro would join the Kokuchukai where he would meet his ally and later factional enemy Nissho Inuoe. Senoo argues that ,'the capitalist system generates suffering and, thus, violates the spirit of Buddhism.'. He is critical of both orthodox Marxists who deny the importance of spirituality and of pro-war Buddhists who support Japanese Imperialism. Senoo sees suffering as something not just to be transcended through spirituality but also an existential material condition to be analyzed and eliminated. Senoo believed in the creation of a 'pure buddha-land' (jōbukkokudo) in this world through new Buddhist Socialist ideals which would lead to our spiritual liberation as well as social and economic emancipation (kaihō). By 1936 he is leader of the Kokuchukai Youth League, in which grants him greater control for his party faction."
KANJI_LEADER_DESC:0 "Ishiwara was born in Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture, in 1889, into a samurai class family. His father was a police officer, but as his clan had supported the Tokugawa bakufu and then the Northern Alliance during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, its members were shut out of higher government positions. At 13, Ishiwara was enrolled in a military preparatory school. He graduated second in his class in 1918 from the army collge. Ishiwara spent several years in various staff assignments and then was selected to study in Germany as a military attaché. He stayed in Berlin and in Munich from 1922 to 1925, focusing on military history and military strategy. He hired several former officers from the German General Staff to tutor him, and by the time that he returned to Japan, he had formed a considerable background on military theory and doctrine. Prior to leaving for Germany, Ishiwara had converted to Nichiren Buddhism. Nichiren had taught that a period of massive conflict would precede a golden era of human culture in which the truth of Buddhism would prevail. Japan would be the center and main promulgator of the faith, which would encompass the entire world. Ishiwara feels that the period of world conflict is fast approaching, and that Japan should  rely upon its vision of the kokutai and its sacred mission to 'liberate' China, would lead a unified East Asia to defeat the West. Ishiwara would be promoted colonel on his arrival back to Japan. After which he would join Kokuchukai and join up with Nissho Inoue to overthrown the Japanese government. "

 JAP_emperor_hirohito_desc:0 "Hirohito is the Emperor and Divine Head of State for Japan. He himself had the final say in domestic and foreign policy whilst not having sway over the elected member of the diet.

His rights included to sanction and promulgate laws, to execute them and to exercise 'supreme command of the Army and the Navy'.  The Emperor himself is head of the state religion of Shinto. as of 1936 Hirohito has been losing some power to the imperial diet. This itself prompting rumored military radicalism in the military."

 #Desc
 superevents_numbers_1_desc:0 "A power struggle between the military and the government had been raging in Japan for months, but it was won by a few young officers and Kita Ikki. They were radical nationalists who tried to fuse socialist theory with the Emperor System, and their leader Kita Ikki, among others, advocated National Socialism and Asian solidarity. We should pay renewed attention to Japan's future developments."
 superevents_numbers_2_desc:0 "In a few days, the Japanese system has changed drastically. Nakano Seigō, several Tōhōkai members, and a small number of Ishin-ha generals took full control of Japan in a short period of time and seized the imperial capital. Immediate martial law mercilessly destroyed all resistance and evoked a totalism storm in East Asia."
