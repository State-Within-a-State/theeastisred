taiwan_info.1.desc:0 "Our story begins with the Qing dynasty's conquest of Taiwan. In 1683 the Qing annex Taiwan and make it apart of Fujian prefecture. The Qing would face rebellion from the natives much like those who controlled Taiwan before them. After the opium wars and losses to outside imperial powers the Qing's hold on Taiwan falters. Looking on this weakness, Japan goes to war with China for greater influence over Korea in 1895. For the Qing this would be a loss for them in 1896. This ends China's era in Taiwan and ushers in the Japanese era over Taiwan. \n\n§FJapanese Rule:§! \n\n After the loss to Japan, remaining Qing officials briefly proclaim the Republic of Formosa as to resist Japanese rule. Tho this would be pacified along with the dying indigenous rebels who by 1914 are mainly in the mountains. For the Great Weltkrieg Taiwanese nationals would be conscripted to fight in Asia against the Central Powers along with other Japanese colonial troops. By the end of the war, Japan had accepted a mild loss. This itself would inspire an increase in Taiwan independence violence. As a result new laws are introduced as early as 1915(before the war's end) to allow for some expression of Taiwanese cultures. But on the other hand would encourage further Japanese immigration to the island. Trying to allow a greater growth of the Japanese population on the island. \n\n After the Great Weltkrieg, the growing concern over further population discontent, as a result the Japanese government allows Taiwanese political parties to form and participate in the colonial diet. This move would also be used as a way to further integrate Taiwan into Japan. As the 20's role on, new Taiwan poltical organizations are formed, with the Home Rule Association, tho also some exiled and banned parties like the Taiwanese Communist Party and Taiwanese People's Party and KMT. These groups would initiate both violent and non violent resistance on the island. \n\n By 1936 the island faces an ever growing resistance but also greater efforts to integrate the island as the Navy and Army seek to control off the civilian government as to further their own interests. Taiwan becomes a ticking time bomb."

TAI_japanese_lapdogs_desc:0 "After our takeover of Taiwan from the corpse of the Qing Empire, we started grooming the island to our liking through influence of our great Japanese culture. This itself would be scaled back in 1915 as to curb the ever growing resistance. Tho after Japan's loss in the Weltkrieg, there has been a steady incline in freedom for Taiwan but also resistance against Japan. As greater political reforms were established, political parties were formed in which would partially advocate for the continuation of Japanese rule. Unsurprisingly these advocates would be placed into power, in which they would be called Japanese lapdogs by the island resistance."
TAI_violent_resistance:0 "Violent Resistance"
TAI_violent_resistance_desc:0 "After Japan's conquest of Taiwan, new resistance movements pop up left and right. The resistance itself is divided between pro Chinese and pro native stances. In the mountains are the natives, who use guerilla warfare in the heights to pounce on local supplies and Japanese patrols. But on the ground are the pro Chinese rebels who use the cities and low level jungles, executing police and assassinating government and army officials. As the resistance grows their becomes grand concern on how Japan can maintain Japanese rule."
TAI_non_violent_resistance:0 "Non-Violence"
TAI_non_violent_resistance_desc:0 "After Japan's conquest of Taiwan, new resistance movements pop up left and right. The resistance itself is divided between pro Chinese and pro native stances. Tho the non violent resistance that has formed is more pro Chinese rather than pro native. The forms of non violence include some politicians  passing laws that remove Japanese military influence, with also peaceful protests and strikes and small acts of decent like the boycott of Japanese goods. Tho the Japanese army stationed there would crackdown on these forms of non violence protests fearing they would become violent protest."
TAI_rsupress_three_vices:0 "Crushing the 3 Vices"
TAI_rsupress_three_vices_desc:0 "The 'Three Vices' considered by the Office of the Governor-General to be archaic and unhealthy were the use of opium, foot binding, and the wearing of queues. \n\n Much like mainland China in the late nineteenth century, opium addiction was a serious social problem in Taiwan, with some statistics suggesting that over half of the ethnic Chinese population of Taiwan were users of the drug. The intentional disfigurement of female feet through binding was common to mainland Chinese and Taiwanese society at the time, and the queue hairstyle worn by the male population was forced upon Han Chinese by the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty. \n\n Ever since the Japanese occupation, Japanese rule has been trying to outlaw and ban these practices as to make Taiwan a 'Model Colony'."

POLITICS_XIE_XUEHONG_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! October 17, 1901, in Changhua County, Japanese Taiwan, Japanese Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Freedom has come at last to Taiwan, thanks in no small part because of foreign help but also because of the tireless revolutionary efforts of the Taiwanese Syndicalist Party. Xie Xuehong, Jian Ji and many others joined up with the Taiwanese Taiwanese Cultural Association in its fight for Taiwanese independence/autonomy and democracy. The Cultural Association quickly succumbed to infighting (not to mention Japanese suppression), and from it splintered off multiple groups.\n\nXie was a member of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, having studied abroad in Sun Yat-sen University in France before founding the Taiwanese Syndicalist party in 1928 with the tacit support of both Japanese and Chinese socialists. Although she was tolerant of bourgeoisie participation in the independence movement, she is also a committed socialist and has since broken hard with Jiang Weishui's Taiwan's People's Party. The TSP claim to have a more authentic interpretation of the Three Principles, denouncing TPP \"lies\" and often competing unsuccessfully with them for peasant and worker support.\n\nUnlike many of her fellow Chinese syndicalists however, she maintains that Taiwan has a distinct identity and must be ruled by Taiwanese - at least on a local level. This cost her personal support, but in the end her viewpoint prevailed with the establishment of an quasi-independent government. Her party remains divided into radical and moderate wings, and despite their flowery liberation rhetoric their grip remains largely constrained to major cities. Whether or not it will last after foreign troops are pulled out, or if it'll end up rejoining a sympathetic China or Japan remains to be seen."

POLITICS_JIANG_WEISHUI_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! August 6th, 1890, in Yilan, Fujian-Taiwan Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! A scholar, physician and anti-Japanese activist, Jiang Weishui was a founding member of the Taiwanese Cultural Association. In a famous essay \"Certificate of Clinical Diagnosis\", he wrote of a patient suffering from severe cultural malnutrition - Taiwan. A powerful speaker, he was frequently imprisoned, just barely surviving typhoid in 1931.\n\nHis drift leftwards had raised many eyebrows within the Association, and he created the Taiwanese People's Party as a fragment of the Kuomintang shortly after it's failure in the Northern Expedition. Maintaining their beliefs in the Three Principles, they adopted similar symbols but distanced themselves in other respects - which hardly prevented Japanese suppression.\n\nDisgruntled by the failures of peaceful protest, he has consolidated power around himself. He often clashes with his erstwhile subordinate Cai Peihuo, who wishes for the TPP to avoid class conflict and socialism. Their disagreements however appear at least temporarily mended by the establishment of the new Republic and Jiang has been elevated to heroic status.\n\nSome call him Taiwan's Sun Yat-sen, though if that's the case he has plenty of work cut out for him. Taiwan's identity remains fragmented, with supporters of unification with both Japan and China. Jiang's party-state is unlikely to last for very long before it seeks autonomy with one of them, but until then they are determined to transform Taiwanese society."

POLITICS_LIAO_WENKUI_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! November 14, 1905, in Yunlin County, Japanese Taiwan, Japanese Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Perhaps the least likely outcome of a new Taiwanese state was a republic led by the youthful liberalism of the Taiwan Restoration Comrades Association. But the writings of Liao Wenkui and many other youthful, foreign educated technocrats won over occupation authorities with their promises of substantive democratic change of the island, and now they have been charged with establishing a provisional Republic of Taiwan.\n\nThe Liao's came from a prominent local family, large landowners with strong Confucian values. His father however converted to Christianity as part of their pivot towards the west, and Liao went to Japan to study. Combining Chinese philosophy with Western Science, he continued his education in China at Jinling University and then in the University of Chicago in the United States. He also briefly went to Europe, meeting his wife, while cultivating his own political world-view.\n\nWith tensions rising after the collapse of the League, Liao found himself an intermediary figure between the clashing factions across the strait. He took over his father's company along with his brother Wenyi, renaming it Dacheng Industrial Co., and used it to cultivate ties from Taipei to Shanghai.\n\nWith contacts across the political aisle and a foreign-friendly appearance, perhaps the Association was a good fit as a bridge between foreign \"liberators\" and the locals. But idealism goes only goes so far, a fact that Taiwan's budding democracy has soon found out."

POLITICS_LIN_XIANTANG_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! October 22, 1881, in Taichung, Fujian-Taiwan Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Lin Xiantang was a member of the Taiwanese Cultural Association, a broad-tent group of Taiwanese intellectuals seeking greater democracy and autonomy under Japanese rule. From a wealthy land-lord family, he joined various revolutionary societies and even renounced his Japanese citizenship in in favour of a Republic of China one in 1913. He never learned Japanese, preferring Hokkien (and in private, has begun learning Mandarin).\n\nHe and many others, dissatisfied by the leftist turn of the Association and Jiang's Taiwanese People's Party, formed their own Taiwanese Alliance for Home Rule in 1930. They were expelled in a bitter divorce with the TPP, and sought a peaceful olive branch with Japanese authorities. This did not help them however, and they were banned shortly after the TPP.\n\nStill, they lingered on, utilising Lin's vast resources joined by other Taiwanese conservatives who sought autonomy (and a few daring to dream of even independence). That wish was finally granted with the demise of the Japanese empire. With the support of foreign backers, the short-lived The Republic of Formosa has been restored - finally realising a project his father and other family members fought for.\n\nOne can only wonder for how long this new republic will last, for now it remains effectively a protectorate for outside powers. Lin and other gentry-men have elected to take things one day at a time, even as it balances it's reactionary and more moderate wings."

POLITICS_LIN_XIONGZHENG_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! November 5, 1888, in Taipeh Prefecture, Fujian-Taiwan Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Lin Xiongzheng has been described as one of the few fat men in Japanese Formosa, a testament to his wealth and power. After the annexation of Taiwan by Japan, his family initially moved to Fuzhou but returned shortly afterwards. In the new Japanese order, Lin managed to leverage his local connections to secure himself a powerful place in the regime. He was a member of the Governor-General's council and hosted many high-society events, including a visit by then Crown-prince Hirohito.\n\nHe also was a supporter of the Tongmenghui, keeping good ties with the Chinese. A sugar-baron, he has participated in various disputes with the farmers while also maintaining a strong public image as a philanthropist. When a new conqueror moved into Taiwan, he was an early candidate for leadership. In this capacity, he joins a clique of prominent Taiwanese gentry, financial interests, and business elites - chief among them being his new deputy Lan Gaochuan, a veteran of the Yiwei War against Japan. Some even believe that Lan, with his extensive connections, is the true master of the government though with most decisions made behind closed doors its hard to tell.\n\nIn many ways, the old General-Governorship has never left, replaced by a slightly more autonomous native upper-class. Left as a pseudo-colonial servitude, Formosa marches to a new future with Lin as their President - whatever it may be."
