imperium.2.t:0 "Rise of the Imperium"
imperium.2.d:0 "As it does most nights, the crisp snowfall blankets the mountain trails and peaks that dot the Nepali highlands. But tonight is no ordinary night. Where the snow usually brings peace and tranquility, tonight it brings something far more foreboding. Rumors and whispers have spread like wildfires from Gurkha border patrols to small villages of something stalking in the storms. Traveling merchants and monks claim they have heard the sound of heavy metal and foreign chanting on the howls of the wintry winds, while the occasional wandering shepherd claims to have caught a glance of “metal men” who move with the speed and silence of a snow leopard. But tonight, these rumors are put to end, for He will live in the shadows of chaos and disorder no longer. The thunderous cracks and ecchlesiarchical chants coming from beyond the mountain peaks are from none other than Jiddu Krishnamurti and his growing legions of Garjana yōd'dhā, or “Thunder Warriors,” religious zealots and other devotees willing to through their life down for their Emperor. Though known locally as a theosophical leader, the great “World Learner” Krishnamurti has increasingly distanced himself from the movement who made him in order to exercise his own grand archetypal plan for a new world - a one and unified Holy Terra, free from chaos and sin. Now with all his men in place and all the preparations done, the eve of His ascension upon us, and nothing will stand in His way."
imperium.2.a:0 "It is time for the Emperor to reveal himself to mankind."

imperium.3.t:0 "The Coup"
imperium.3.d:0 "With His revelation to the world being met with laughs and jeers instead of the open arms and revelry He had so hoped for, it was decided what He must do. The gears were already in motion for His grand machinations and there was no turning back now. Humanity needed its hero, its guiding light. On this day, Jibbu Krishnamurti must leave behind his mere mortal form to become something beyond, something divine. Regaled in the brightest of armors his metal smiths could muster, He rallied his Thunder Warriors and rode off to Kathmandu to begin his holy quest while his underground metal foundries toil endlessly to churn out more and more armor and weapons for his brave soldiers to adorn. Upon arriving in the Nepali capital, the sheer radiance reflecting off His armor was nearly too much to bear for the weak, sinful eyes of the locals to bear witness. As the huddled and tired masses watched in awe, struggling to see through sunbeams and tears, He announced that he would be their savior, a savior for all Mankind to adore. The crowds dropped to their knees and prayed to Him, pledging their lives and loyalty to His cause. The Emperor of Mankind now has his foothold and with it he will be the Savior that humanity does not know it needed, whether they accept him with open arms or must be crushed under his legion's iron boots."
imperium.3.a:0 "Today, Kathmandu. Tomorrow, all of Terra. For the Imperium, for the Emperor!"

imperium.4.t:0 "End of Strife"
imperium.4.d:0 "Now that a stable base of operations has been established, the Emperor can get to work on unifying the disparate "clans" of Holy Terra into one unified Imperium. To ensure His holy deed is successful, the Emperor first seeks to establish full control over the Himalayan Plateau. With large underground spaces already being excavated in the Nepali mountains for a myriad of uses, He seeks to link these with future underground systems across the plateau to ensure a secure and secretive operating base for His more...sensitive projects. To accomplish this, the first of the Emperor's Lightning Warrior legions must leave the secluded Nepali hinterlands and trek into the rest of the Himalayas to strengthen His position. Though humanity has treated this corner of the world as a backwater for millennia, under His guidance we will show the world what it means to be a true member of Mankind. To bless his troops before they embark, His Majesty the Emperor has some final words of wisdom: 'The universe has many horrors yet to throw at us. This is not the end of our struggle. This is just the beginning of our crusade to save Humanity. Be faithful! Be strong! Be vigilant!'"
imperium.4.a:0 "No world shall be beyond my rule; no enemy shall be beyond my wrath"

imperium.5.t:0 "The Great Crusade"
imperium.5.d:0 "With the Himalayan Plateau fully and firmly in the grasp of the Emperor and His forces, His ever-vigilant gaze now turns to the rest of humanity. He watches them argue and fight over petty differences when the true horrors in store have yet to appear. This must not be left to stand - every single human soul must be under the Emperor's guiding light, and it is time for Him to prove this fact to the rest of Mankind. With his legions fully armed, his factories endlessly creating new weapons of war, and his more secretive projects finally showing promise, He knows it is now time to act. The final day of judgement is upon humanity, and the only one pure enough to pass judgement is He. Under the Emperor, Humankind will never fail. The Age of Strife is over; the Great Crusade has begun. These Unification Wars will be won and no enemy will be left breathing in His wake. All of Mankind will bend the knee to our one holy Emperor"
imperium.5.a:0 "For the Imperium! For the Emperor!"
