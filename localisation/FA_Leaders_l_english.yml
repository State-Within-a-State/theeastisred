After it's defeat in the Russian Intervention Lessing moved to Germany where he attempted to spread the ideology of Lenin and incite a workers revolt. Chased out of Germany in 1935 by angry police officers, Lessing sought refuge in the Union of Britain, witch denied him entry on account of his support for Bolshevik groups within the UoB. Chased by the German police, Lessing fled Europe and began a journey that eventually lead him to the jungles of Rhodesia where he attempted to set up a Marxist-Leninist Society among the native population in a remote village."
POLITICS_DORISLESSING_DESC:0 "Doris was born in Kermanshah, Iran, on 22 October 1919, to Captain Alfred Tayler and Emily Maude Tayler, both British subjects. Her father, who had lost a leg during his service in World War I, met his future wife, a nurse, at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he was recovering from his amputation. The couple would leave Britain after the revolution and go to Iran, for Alfred to take a job as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia. In 1925, the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. As a girl Doris was educated first at the Dominican Convent High School, a Roman Catholic convent all-girls school in the Southern Rhodesian capital of Salisbury. She left school at age 13 and was self-educated from then on. She left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading material that her employer gave her on politics and sociology and began writing around this time. In 1937, Doris moved to London in the Union of Britain to pursue her writing career and socialist beliefs. She only just returned to her home of Rhodesia after it was liberated by the proletariat and its chains were broken."
POLITICS_GARFIELD_DESC:0 "Todd was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, in 1908. Todd emigrated to Southern Rhodesia from New Zealand in 1934 as a Protestant missionary and ran the Dadaya New Zealand Churches of Christ Mission school. Todd plans to introduce modest reforms aimed at improving the education of the black majority by taking tax-money paid by Rhodesian property owners and appropriations from the British colonial authorities, and directing it toward black schools. He has also devised a plan to give elementary education to every African of school age. Todd previously pushed a bill through the Legislative Assembly that would allow for multiracial trade unions in order to undercut the growing white nationalist influence in the unions."
POLITICS_HUGGINS_DESC:0 "Huggins was born in Bexley in north Kent, England on the 6th of July, 1883. After practising medicine and training as a surgeon in London, Huggins travelled to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia in 1911 to act as a locum to some doctors there. He would return  to the UK in late 1914 following the outbreak of war and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps with the rank of Captain, stationed at Colchester Hospital which had become a casualty clearing station. Although he wanted to go to France he was sent to Malta where he dealt with incoming casualties from the Battle of Gallipoli. He returned to Southern Rhodesia at the end of the war and bought Craig Farm on the outskirts of Salisbury. He began again as a surgeon, quickly becoming the best known in Rhodesia. Though he was on the side of union with South Africa when there was a referendum on the matter, he has since accepted the Rhodesian decision to 'go it alone.'"
POLITICS_BOMBER_DESC:0 "Harris was born on 13 April 1892, at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where his parents were staying while his father George Travers Harris was on home leave from the Indian Civil Service. With his father in India most of the time, Harris grew up without a sense of solid roots and belonging. Harris was educated at Allhallows School in Devon. A former Allhallows student, the actor Arthur Chudleigh often visited the school and gave the boys free tickets to his shows. Harris received such a ticket in 1909, and went to see the play during his summer holidays. The lead character in the show was a Rhodesian farmer who returned to England to wed, but ultimately fell out with his pompous fiancée and married the more practical housemaid instead. The idea of a country where one was judged on ability rather than class was very inspiring to the adventurous Harris, who promptly told his father that he intended to emigrate to Southern Rhodesia instead of going back to Allhallows for the new term and would arrive in Rhodesia in 1910. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Harris did not learn of it for nearly a month, being out in the bush at the time. Despite his previous reluctance to follow the path his father had had in mind for him in the army, and his desire to set up his own ranch in Rhodesia, Harris felt patriotically compelled to join the war effort. In October 1915, after unsuccessfully attempting to find a position in first the cavalry, then the Royal Artillery, Harris joined the Royal Flying Corps and would learn to fly later that year. Harris remained in the newly formed Royal Air Force following the end of the First World War, but would return to Rhodesia after the defeat of the government by the syndicalist forces."
POLITICS_FIELD_DESC:0 "Winston Field was born on 13 April 1892, in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, England. He would move to Southern Rhodesia in the 20's and become a tobacco farmer. After the fall of Britain to Syndicalisim, he became a committed anti-syndicalist and a powerful voice in the British-dominated areas of the Federation, namely Rhodesia. Now he has been elected to lead Rhodesia through her first of many challenges, unto the bright and early dawn."
POLITICS_BADEN_DESC:0 "Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street, Paddington in London, on 22 February 1857. After having been educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. During the final year Weltkreig Powell was appointed supreme commander of British Africa in order to boost failing British Morale. After the war's end he was offered a role in both the Canadian and South African militaries witch he turned down in favor of retirement in German occupied Rhodesia from where he coordinated with many nations in order to promulgate the Boy Scouts program. Powell Despises Syndicalisits for destroying his beloved Empire, and has been called to lead a free, British Rhodesia in this hour of need. With the hero of the Matabele war on their side Rhodesians are ready to reclaim lost glory."
POLITICS_BURKE_DESC:0 "There is something almost tragic about the life of Desmond Lardner-Burke, it's probably why he's such an intractable individual today. Born in the Cape of Good Hope in 1909, young Burke aspired to be a lawyer but fate wouldn't have it that way. Burke was only a young boy when word returned home that many of his brothers were slaughtered by the German Imperial Forces in East Africa, this set off a chain reaction that would come to define Burke for the rest of his life. When the empire collapsed in 1925, the legacy of Cecil Rhodes died with it, this fact coincided with the death of his brothers by German hands, fueled a furious anger inside Burke, one that would never cease. Burke became active in politics soon after and helped form a grand coalition of Pro-British and Far-Right factions dubbed the "Rhodesian Front", which would rise in popularity during the 20s and early 30s. Burke would be the face of this movement, becoming known as a young radical in a sea of old politicians, he would use this popularity to get several of his ideological points to the masses and subsequently entrench them in the Rhodesian Front. After allying with the United Federal Party and seizing power after the 1937 Constitutional election, Burke now resides over a nation as shattered and broken as he once was, but Burke will rebuild Rhodesia into his image and stand up to the Hunnic Menace, by any means necessary."

###Mittelafrika###
POLITICS_WARLORD_GOERING_DESC:0 "Hermann Göring had seen a lot in his time, but perhaps the most profound experience of his life was the collapse of Mittelafrika. Now, he had the power he always craved. Now, he had control of more resources than most men could ever imagine. However, Göring was not content to sit on what he was given. Instead, he has decided to make something of these circumstances. Göring has begun the work of transforming his territory into what he calls "Goeringia", a realm in which his word is gospel and every whim is followed. This will be no easy task though: the economy is crumbling, the natives complain about their sixteen hour work days, and and Göring's rivals crowd around him. With his old friends in German industry and his new ones in the African drug trade, though, Göring is confident he has the talent and resources he needs to overcome all of these threats. One day, the world might even see a new Mittelafrika...."
POLITICS_VORBECK_DESC:0 "Where does one even begin with the Lion of Afrika? Born in 1870 on the Prussian Rhine, Born into minor Pomeranian nobility, Paul Von Lettow-Vorbeck was destined to be an army man. Joining in 1890 as a lieutenant, Vorbeck saw action in China during the Boxer Rebellion during 1900 and was later assigned to German Southwest Afrika in 1904. During the Nama uprising and subsequent pursuit of insurrection leader Jacob Morenga, Vorbeck was brutally injured during a gunfight with Morenga, leaving him half blind. After a brief stint commanding the German colonial forces in Kamerun, Vorbeck was posted to East Afrika where he would be detrimental to the war effort and be the catalyst that would save the East African Campaign. Vorbeck would be apart of several famous battles such as Ngonamo and he would also lead several raiding parties against the British in areas like Rhodesia and Kenya. After successfully beating back the British, Vorbeck helped create the modern Mittelafrikan state and helped again during the British collapse of authority in Afrika but he would return back to Germany, that was until now. Due to several reasons, The Lion of Afrika is back in his old stomping ground and has said enough is enough! Vorbeck is going to do everything in his power to make sure that he can get this mess of a colonial state back on it's feet, but it's unknown whether he can keep this promise."
POLITICS_KENYATTA_DESC:0 "Jomo Kenyatta has been called many things: a dreamer, a fool, an idealist, but now he is known as Staathalter, or Mzee by the natives.  Born in 1897 with the name of Kamau wa Muigai to prosperous Kikuyu farmers in the village of Nginda, Kenyatta received a traditional upbringing common of his people. He joined a christian camp in Thogoto as a young man where he would learn to read and write and convert to Chrstianity. During the war, Kenyatta attended classes at the mission and would hold many varied jobs, interacting with the various peoples of Kenya. With each group he worked with, he would adopt some of their native customs as his own such as wearing a beaded belt of the Maasai culture known as a kinyata; a gift given to him by the Maasai chieftain who married his aunt. Kenyatta would soon adopt the name of this garment as his last name, and later, upon publishing his first works, changed his first name as well to Jomo, based on the Kikuyu word for removing a sword from its scabbard. As the great war raged, he would move around constantly, planting the seeds of his pan-Afrikan ideas.In the years immediately following the end of the Weltkireg, Kenyatta begrudgingly learned German to accommodate for Kenya’s new overlords and would join up with the Kikuyu Central Association, slowly beginning to form his unique national-conservative yet leftist, pan-African political ideology. He would further radicalize after traveling to Europe years later, visiting leftist and nationalist groups in London and Berlin. Now, after climbing through the ranks of the Left-Reformgruppe with the German’s leash limiting his radicalization, Kenyatta has won the first free elections of the Kolonialbund-Mittelafrika. With his surprising win, he has achieved the dreams of Pan-Africanism without a single drop of blood being spilt, native or otherwise. He now looks towards the future to make his final dream a reality: a true Pan-African Federation."
POLITICS_BELL_DESC:0 "Alexander Duala Manga Bell is a man of high regard and station here in the Dark Continent. Born in 1897 in Duala region of Deutsch-Kamerun Cameroon, he traveled to Germany at age the age of four to be educated in the great schools of Europe. Serving gallantly in the Weltkrieg, he fought the vile Entente powers as an officer at Gallipoli. Following the war, given his intelligence and valiant service, the Kaiserreich had Bell stay in Berlin to be thoroughly "Germanized" in preparation for his return to Kamerun, hoping to use him as a local leader in the now gargantuan mess of the newly created Mittelafika. Returning to Kamerun in 1922, accompanied with his new wife and children he met while living in Germany, Bell came home as a hero and a statesman who had received the blessing and praise of the Kaiser himself. Bell's monarchist sympathies and conservative views align well with the German administration, and has now shocked the world with his recent win in Mittelafrika's first continent-wide elections. Under his watch, Mittelafrika shall be transformed into a true Kingdom under the Kaiser, bringing his light to the Dark Continent, and Staathalter Bell shall guide the way." 
POLITICS_SCHNEE_DESC:0 "Few men have seen the world like Heinrich Albert Schnee has. Born in Neuhaldensleben in 1871, Schnee would study law in Heidelberg, Kiel, and Berlin. Upon graduating, he fell into work at the Federal Foregin Office, seeing political service in German holdings New Guinea, Samoa, and Qingdao, as well as the German embassy in London. Shortly before the fires of the Weltkrieg began, he became Hautpmann of East Afrika, leading its fierce Schutztruppe when the war finally broke out. It was then that he would strike up a fierce rivalry with Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, a rivalry that still persists to this day. Since the end of the war, he decided to stick around and has worked his way up the hierarchy of the Dark Continent. Now residing as the Staathalter of all of Mittelafrika, he and the DKG have had a stranglehold on Mittelafrikan politics. Despite his now long reigning dominance in the colony, storm clouds are on the horizon as unrest rises throughout the Kaiser’s Afrikan holdings, and his continued reign is far from certain."
POLITICS_EPSTEIN_DESC:0 "Albert Göring lived in the shadow of his older brother Hermann for much of his young life. Born in 1895, the fifth child esteemed Hauptmann of Südwestafrika Heinrich Göring, Albert and his brother seemed destined for service to the Kaiserreich from birth. Their family was “low nobility” and he lived quite the aristocratic life before serving his country bravely in the Weltkrieg. Always the intelligent and soft-mannered man, after the war he would find peace in filmmaking for a few years before his older brother’s appointment to high office in the Mittelafrikan colonies. With Hermann helping him along the way, Albert would spread his wings while living in Mittelafrika, achieving a great measure of political success, partially thanks to the great weight his family name carried but also due to his scholarly mind and tact for discussion, debate, and compromise. Now, Albert has reached a level of success that surpasses that of even his father, reigning as Staathalter of the entirety of Mittelafrika. From atop this lofty throne, Albert Göring shall blaze his own legacy free from the shadow of his family name, and seek to usher in a new era of prosperity and understanding across the Dark Continent."


###Mau-Mau###
POLITICS_STANLEY_MATHENGE_DESC:0 "When Mathenge brutally eliminated his rivals for power within Kinyaa, he had no intention of slowing down or stopping there. Now that he is in power, he has plans for his people. With the European imperialists largely out of the picture, Mathenge believes it is time to give the formerly stolen land back to the native populations, who will farm it and tend to it as their ancestors did. For Mathenge, it is more than just revering the traditions of our ancestors; we must also ensure the dominance of the Kikuyus in our part of the continent. To do so, he believes we should bring our weaker neigbhors into the fold in order to create a united front against any European who tries to take back this land. Equally as important as this, it is crucial that the influence of European culture and faith is wiped from Africa, and this will be done through force if necessary. Mathenge, though presenting a tough image to the world, only wishes to see his people prosper as they did before the meddlesome hands of outsiders forced their way into the lives of the Kikuyu people. With enough resources at his disposal, and the will to bring the nation into the Modern Era industrially and militarily, he could very well see this desire come to fruition..."
POLITICS_DEDAN_KIMATHI_DESC:0 "Dedan Kimathi, at only eighteen years old, has beaten his rivals to become the leader of Kinyaa. He has created legitimacy for himself by taking the son of his mentor and former leader, Hussein Obama, into his own care. Now, serving as regent for the young Obama, Kimathi has had no problem articulating his vision to his people. For Kimathi, the implementation of socialism in the nation's agrarian sector is key to seeing its farmers prosper. Meanwhile, Kimathi does not look as unfavorably towards Europeans as his fellow revolutionaries have; as long as they are aligned with the Third Internationale, Kimathi does not care. Instead, he hopes to model his new state partly off of their example and partly off his own beliefs, which entail local democracy for his people and unity among Kenyans. To guarantee the continued existence of his new fragile state, Kimathi has expressed a desire for a strong military and industrial sector alike. With the ability to fend off invaders, both inwardly and from across the ocean, Kimathi can focus on building a strong state for his people."
