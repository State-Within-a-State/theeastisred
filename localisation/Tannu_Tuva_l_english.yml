tanu.1.desc:0 "The Mad baron the self proclaimed "Genghis khan the second" has pushed the working tanu tuvans to breaking point. His repressive and anti-Tuvan policies  has caused more and more discontent amongst the  Tuvan popuation . They are now at breaking point . After a couple of workers strikes that have been put down by Mongolian Police forces , the Tanu Tuvan people have rallied under the red flag of socialism and in turn have risen to put a swift and bloody end to the Mad Barons rule. \n\nThe leadership are currently debating declaring themselves as a separate Tanu Tuvan peoples republic and breaking away as a sovereign state from Mongolia , once the mad barron has been ousted from power."
