However, after Dr. Sun’s death, the faction became increasingly political, with Hu Hanmin assuming leadership. The Xishan Conference Faction passed a resolution declaring the CSP illegal and adopted factional resolutions that were anti-syndicalist and anti-United Front.

Following Chiang Kai-shek’s death, Hu Hanmin denounced his followers, leading to a small expulsion of Dai Jitao from the Xishan faction.

###Political Descriptions###
ZHANG_MINGQI_POLITICAL_DESC:0 "Zhang Mingqi was born in Wudi, Shandong Province. He was a candidate for the Sino-Japanese War imperial examination in 1894. In 1898, he studied under the famous scholar Cen Chunxuan and was highly appreciated. After 1900, he followed Cen Chunxuan to Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guangxi and other places, and served successively as the Guangxi Academic Affairs Office, the Camp Affairs Office, the Chief Envoy of Guangxi, and the Governor of Guangxi. In 1910, he was promoted to governor of Guangdong and Guangxi and general in charge of Guangzhou for bribing Prince Yikuang of Qing. He stubbornly supported the imperial system, opposed democracy and republic, and wanted to kill revolutionaries. In April 1911, he commanded the suppression of the Huanghuagang Uprising. After the success of the Revolution of 1911 , he fled to Japan with money. After Yuan Shikai came to power, he returned to China and was named a first-class earl in 1915 for supporting Yuan Shikai's restoration of the monarchy. After Yuan Shikai's death, Zhang Mingqi fled to Tianjin. In 1930, Zhang would be invited back to the governorship of Liangguang by the Qing in exchange for further crackdowns upon the bandits that roamed the province at the time. Though since his appointment as governor, Zhang has become considered a German/Qing puppet which has somewhat intensified resistance efforts against him by the KMT and local warlords. Another issue is his increasing unpopularity with the population due to his ties with imperial Japan, further cementing fears of a possible rebellion against him. Due to this the Qing, Germans and League of Eight Provinces have been sending in troops, money, and other aid to help Zhang quash the internal bandits."
POLITICS_PRC_XU_CHONGZHI_DESC:0 "Xu Chongzhi was born into the famous Xiguan Xu family in Guangzhou. In 1903, he entered the third infantry class of the Japanese Army Academy. In 1906, he joined the Tongmenghui. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as the commander of the 20th Brigade of the 10th Regiment of the Fuzhou Army. He participated in the uprising and served as the commander-in-chief of the uprising army. That year, he even threatened his superior, Fujian Admiral Sun Daoren, to join the Tongmenghui. In November 1911, he ordered the uprising army to fire the first artillery shell, which marked the beginning of the Fujian Uprising War. The Qing army was ultimately defeated. In 1913, he participated in the "Second Revolution" and fled to Japan after its failure. In Japan, he joined Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Revolutionary Party. At the end of 1915, he returned to China and participated in the Anti-Yuan National Defense War. After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, he returned to Shanghai and served as the Minister of Military Affairs of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. In 1917, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Grand Marshal's Office of Sun Yat-sen's Law Protection Military Government, assisted Sun Yat-sen in presiding over military affairs, and became one of the main military leaders of the Guangdong Army. In 1919, the Guangdong Army was reorganized into two armies, with Chen Jiongming as the Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong Army and the Commander of the First Army, and Xu Chongzhi as the Commander of the Second Army. After Chen Jiongming's subordinates launched the June 16th Incident, Xu Chongzhi's troops entered southern Fujian via Jiangxi. From August to September, Xu Chongzhi's troops cooperated with Wang Yongquan's mixed brigade stationed in Fujian to attack Fuzhou from Jian'ou and Nanping simultaneously. Li Houji fled in panic, and Fujian was occupied by Xu and Wang's troops. In January 1923, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, he served as the commander of the Eastern Route Anti-bandit Army and attacked Chen Jiongming, who was entrenched in Guangdong, from the direction of southern Fujian. In 1924, he became the commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army of the Republic of China and became the highest-ranking military general of the Kuomintang. By 1923, Liangguang was invaded by the Zhili forces of Luo Peijin, leading to the KMT being slowly pushed out, with the final failures of the Northern Expedition by Xu Chongzhi’s close ally Chiang Kai-shek culminating in the KMT’s split and exile from the country. Xu, however, decided to stay and fight in a guerrilla campaign against the Qing and formed the Whampoa faction in mid-1930 to give the guerrilla forces a greater voice within the Right-wing KMT’s party leadership. By 1936, Xu had managed to briefly unite the party in a new struggle against Zhang Mingqi’s Liangguang clique, preparing to take over Liangguang and later the rest of China."

Tianquan was greatly influenced by his mother Zhou Feng's background as a poor farmer. At six, his grandfather sent him to the Qishengma Palace to study at Ma Ziqing's private school. Two years later, he entered Lin Zuci Primary School and studied under Lin Jinting, a member of the Tongmenghui. In 1917, he went to Japan, changed his name to Peng Pai, and enrolled in Political Economics at Waseda University. During his stay, he experienced the rice riots and was deeply affected by the 1917 October Revolution and the May 4th Movement. He participated in anti-German protests, was beaten, and blacklisted by the German police, transforming into a socialist revolutionary. Upon returning to China in 1921, Peng Pai became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and joined the Kuomintang (KMT). He sided with the CPC during the CPC-CSP split but later worked with the Left Kuomintang after the CPC’s dissolution. In response to a petition from students in Haifeng, Chen Jiongming instructed the Haifeng County Magistrate to appoint Peng Pai as the director of the Haifeng County Education Bureau. In March 1922, after issuing a declaration about wall demolition and clashing with the gentry Chen Yuebo, he was forced to leave Haifeng County. Peng Pai participated in establishing the Guangdong Socialist Youth League in Guangzhou. After returning to Haifeng, he was dismissed from his post for organizing a student parade to celebrate May Day. He then engaged in the peasant movement. Peng Pai joined the Kuomintang as an individual and served as the Secretary of the Peasant Department of the Central Executive Committee. He proposed a peasant movement implementation plan, adopted by the Kuomintang. On June 30, 1924, the Kuomintang decided to open the Guangzhou Peasant Movement Workshop based on Peng Pai's proposal. He served as the first Director of the 1st and 5th Agricultural Lecture Centers, completing the "Report on the Peasant Movement in Haifeng." With the defeat of the Kuomintang in the late 1920s, Peng worked with the Left-KMT guerrillas, organizing the Guangxi peasant movements in coordination with the Left-KMT and workers' unions, creating a network to secure the Left-KMT's hold in Guangxi against the Right-KMT, local bandits, and the Qing provincial government."

He was merely an upstart member of the Provincial Assembly, having only been part of an aborted attempt at an uprising before the Xinhai Revolution. When Guangdong declared its independence in October 1911, Chen was elected the commander-in-chief of its forces, the Xunjun, an army of defected army officers, peasants, and revolutionaries. He would lead this revolutionary army and free Guangdong, forcing the Governor-General to flee Guangzhou before joining up with Sun Yat-sen's forces. Under Sun, Chen was known as cautious, perhaps overly so, but competent. When Sun returned in 1917, Chen would be the one to drive Guangxi forces out of Guangdong in a couple of months when Sun split with Lu Rongting. Chen repeatedly advised caution over the Northern Expedition, which, along with intrigue from other Kuomintang officers, further drove Sun and Chen apart until they split in June 1922. In 1925, Chen would return to lead the Guangdong Army against the KMT, but would be defeated and forced into exile. The Kuomintang was then defeated by the Zhili with German help, making Chen's earlier caution rather prophetic as he returned to a Guangdong sapped of its wealth. Though this return would once again become short lived, as Zhili forces would attack and force out Chen's forces from Guangdong, causing his army to fall into disarray Governor of Guangdong, leading Chen to start guerilla warfare in the Guangzhou countryside. As Zhang Mingqi loses his grip on power, Chen has been infiltrating the Liangguang Zhili army, in order to launch a coup and bring him back to leadership of Liangguang.§!"

October 15th, 1889, in Hepu, Guangdong Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§!When the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 broke out, Chen Mingshu eagerly participated, having joined Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui in 1906. Although he enrolled in the Baoding Military Academy in 1912, Chen left the following year to join Sun Yat-sen's ill-fated Second Revolution. As a commander in the National Revolutionary Army, Chen Mingshu led his troops to defeat Chen Jiongming's rebellion in eastern Guangdong and dislodge anti-Kuomintang warlords in Guangxi and Yunnan.\n\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Chen Mingshu led the 10th Division of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, defeating Wu Peifu in a joint operation led by Li Zongren. Despite initial success, disaster soon struck the Kuomintang when the German Empire directly intervened against the Guangzhou Nationalist Government. Chen Mingshu found himself retreating to Guangdong, where Chen Jiongming had reestablished control of Guangzhou following the Kuomintang's collapse. However, this control was again short-lived as Jiongming was forced out by Zhang Mingqi's forces. Both the KMT and Chen Jiongming were driven into the countryside, where Chen Mingshu formed an alliance with the Liangguang Peasant's Association in Guangxi, led by Peng Pai. As the Qing provincial government in Liangguang collapsed, Chen Mingshu's forces, along with Peng Pai's peasant militias, prepared to fight off the RKMT guerrillas and launch an uprising in Guangxi with the goal of liberating China and its people."

GXC_worker_peasant_resistance:0 "Worker Peasant Resistance"
GXC_worker_peasant_resistance_desc:0 "Since the success of Zhang Mingqi’s forces in Liangguang, the Kuomintang and other leftwing groups who opposed the Qing have started a multipronged resistance movement across the province. From non-violent strikes in the cities to full blown guerilla warfare in the countryside, nowhere seems to be safe. This has caused uneasiness within Liangguang due to the brutal action often used by Zhang and his masters abroad to crush the workers and peasants."
GXC_backwards_guangxi: "Guangxi's Struggling Economy"
GXC_backwards_guangxi_desc: "The economy of the province of Guangxi is being sucked dry by the heavy militarisation of its governing clique, as most funds are funnelled into the provincial military. The rate of military spending has become quite unsustainable and the economy suffers as a result. Additional income sources or serious economic reforms may be required to alleviate the situation."
GXC_AOG_leftovers: "Anti-Concessionist Resistance"
GXC_AOG_leftovers_desc: "Since Zhang Mingqi’s restoration of Qing power in Liangguang in the late 20s, Zhang has had to make concessions to German imperialists and their holdings in Asia. This would include giving the city of Guangzhou to the League of Eight Provinces as a concession for continued support against the bandit raids in the region. This however has made the Guangdong administration unpopular with its population as it has continued to sell out itself to foreign imperialists, through means that even harms certain sectors of economic favorability to fufill  more of the imperialist desires of the foreigners. Rioting may break out soon, which could cause a diplomatic incident if the German presence in the city is attacked. For the time being, Chinese businessmen are happily buying out failed or failing German assets in Southern China, increasing their own influence and power in the region."
GXC_factionalism: "Increased Factionalism"
GXC_factionalism_desc: "With the unification of Liangguang under Zhang Mingqi many local warlords from Guangxi and Qiongya joined his side for promises of power and wealth. But as the Qing and Zhang’s government are rapidly weakening, multiple factions within the region have taken this as a signal to push their agenda while ambitious men look for any potential openings towards power with the inclusion of a new spread of KMT/bandit resistance in the regions."

PRC_divided_rays_under_the_sun_desc:0 "With the split of the Kuomintang into the left and right factions, both sides would also experience their own factionalism from within. Since the collapse of our main headquarters, we have had to branch off to multiple HQ’s, reflecting the preferences and conditions of certain factions. The faction currently in charge is the West Hills Group (WHG), who are a group of conservative intellectuals who seek to unite around Dr. Sun’s words, which they argue do not have any pro-socialist sympathies. The WHG currently is based in Hong Kong and Guangzhou in an underground capacity. Second is the Political Science faction, which acts in a more progressive faction of the Right-KMT meaning they are more willing to work with more moderate Left-Kuomintang factions than other Right-Kuomintang factions. The base of the Political Science faction is mainly in Chinese overseas communities and also in underground political scenes within Chinese urban hubs. Third is the Central Club Clique, who are based along with some RKMT guerilla units but have their main leadership located in Japan, which is where they have studied in and have close ties to. The final faction is the Whampoa faction, which is more of a militant faction of New Guangxi Clique officers. They carry out a large part of the RKMT’s guerilla actions in the south with some compromises with their LKMT enemies, as to tackle the Qing/Foreign forces in the region."

Alas this would be futile as the Qing/Zhili forces would crush his advance and Chiang would be forced to retreat south, where he would later be assassinated by a car bomb. This failure would cause many KMT units to both idolize and hate Chiang and would be further pushed into a corner, with many KMT forces going into guerilla warfare and taking different sides in the party split. Now we remember those days in shame but also remember them as a lesson to be learnt. We shall avenge our losses from the 1st expedition and crush the foreign invaders for good."

With this, the peasants have begun taking some matters related to their old lords into their own hands, which we may have to intervene in to allow fair justice to those landlords."

###Events###
liangguang_rd.0.title:0 "A Pearl In the South"
liangguang_rd.0.desc:0 "The Xinhai revolution started a chain of events that would forever change China, and one place with the most impact would be the southern region of Liangguang. The governor at the time Zhang Mingqi would be supported by the Guangdong army to become leader of the Liangguang region, until he fled in 1912 to Japan. With Yuan’s ascension to the presidency, Zhang would be appointed as governor of Liangguang in 1913 and a 1st class earl by 1915, but with the start of the national protection war in 1916, Zhang Mingqi would flee to Hong Kong after Lu Rongting would declare independence for Guangxi, invade Guangdong and join the Kuomintang.\n\nHowever the alliance between Lu and the KMT would collapse with Lu Rongting accepting a new alliance with the Zhili clique. As per retaliation, Chen Jiongming would push Lu out of Guangdong from 1917-1920 in the Yue-Gui War. The KMT were able to return to Guangdong in november 1920. Tensions began to build between Sun Yat-sen and Chen, as Sun acted more and more dictatorially. His extremely unitarist view also irked Chen, who still wanted to pursue his dream of a federal, democratic China.\n\nWhen Chen invited political radicals, including anarchists, the relations between Chen and Sun soured again, and when Sun proposed a so-called "Northern Expedition" in 1922, which would lead to a militarily subjugation of the Northern cliques, Chen entirely turned his back on his former idol, searching for ways to get rid of Sun, as he hoped for peaceful negotiations for unification. In mid-1922, this opportunity arose. The Zhili Clique had won a conflict in the North against the Fengtian Clique, and thus dominated China and pushed for peaceful Chinese reunification. When the Zhili Clique in Beijing recognized his power in Guangdong, Chen decided to abandon Sun and swore his loyalty to the Beiyang government. Unexpectedly revolting against the Kuomintang militarily, Chen led his forces to attack Sun's residence as well as his office and forced him to escape on a ship to Shanghai. Chen had received assurances from the Zhili before that Guangdong would be left in his control, enabling him to pursue his goal of building a model province to act as an example to the others, furthering his goal of a federal China.\n\nChen’s dreams would later be dashed by the invasion of Liangguang by Tang Jiyao, later Luo Peijin in 1923. At this point Chen then realized that the Zhili clique had betrayed him due to their support behind Luo Peijin’s invasion of Liangguang. From this point Chen would be fighting both the Zhili and KMT forces in the region. With the defeat of the KMT after 1927, Chen Jiongming had taken some ground back against the KMT, whilst still being under renewed pressure from Luo Peijin and the Nanjing Clique. By 1930, Chen would be forced to enter into guerilla warfare against the newly victorious provincial government of Liangguang, where Zhang Mingqi would return as governor by early 1931, with Tang Shaoyi becoming Zhang’s 2nd in command. As per 1936, Liangguang has barely managed to stay together, with the constant threat of KMT forces and Chen’s forces further risking Zhang Mingqi’s governorship. The only thing keeping Zhang incharge is the League of Eight Provinces, helping to intervene against the insurgents on Zhang’s behalf."

Such an event has been something that could not have been predicted, with the echoes of the chaos reaching our borders and devestating our economy. Despite this negative news, we have managed to take back Guangzhouwan and Guangzhou from the direct control of League and its German allies, granting our provincial governance some support from the anti-concessionists who have always been a nuisance. Yet even this may not be enough to cool the tide of anti-Qing sentiments which have only grown due to the Qing's rule over China having collapsed."

In order to help resolve the campaign's failures, we will need to gain the support of the population. One option is to start a disinformation campaign that would reveal the socialists as foreign agents whilst also showing the benefits our rule has brought onto the land in order to keep the peasants on side. On the other hand, actions often speak louder than words and increasing our campaigns against banditry would both help with popular support while dealing with many of the Right Kuomintang's local allies."

According to the deal we made with general Long earlier, we have appointed him governor of the region, which has given him the power to decide Hainnan's domestic policies. However, recently Long has demanded even more autonomy. Some advisors argue that this extra autonomy would be beneficial in keeping our control over the island as it would likely lessen the support of the socialists among the local minoirty populations."

This has led to potential worry by members of our army who seems to be seeing an ever more bleak picture for Zhang Mingqi's chances of survival.\n\nAs of now there has been whispers & rumors spreading around the officer corps, with worries of a potential overthrow of Mingqi's government supported by an unknown backer."

liangguang_rd.20.desc:0 "With recent tensions and uneasiness arising from the deteriorating rule of the Mingqi provincial government, police checks upon more radical groups have become more frequent. In one of these check ups, the police managed to learn of and prevent a plot by a group of anarchist radicals to assassinate Zhang Mingqi using an explosive device. Though Zhang would like to investigate this threat to his life, he also knows that diverting resources to investigate some tiny anarchist group when there is a major uprising occuring in the province's western region is not very tactically sound."
liangguang_rd.20.a:0 "We need to raid their houses and headquarters."

liangguang_rd.21.title:0 "Officer Coup Plot Discovered"
liangguang_rd.21.desc:0 "Despite suspicions about military officers ploting to overthrow governor Mingqi, the Mingqi has so far basically ignored it, with there being no proof of a coup attempt. But this situation has changed with one lone officer defecting to Mingqi, telling him of a plot to overthrow him. Mingqi is concerned about the information brought to him but is also skeptical, since he is not sure if the rumour of a plot is a rumour spread by the Guangxi rebels to further sew chaos within the Liangguang ranks."
liangguang_rd.21.a:0 "We should investigate this."
liangguang_rd.21.b:0 "Ignore this nonsense. We can trust our men."

liangguang_rd.22.desc:0 "In the chaos of the past few days, police raided several barracks where anti-Zhili dissent had been spreading as well as the homes of the officers who are now known to have been plotting to overthrown the Liangguang provincial government. With this information, discovering the mastermind of this plot was only a matter of time. It was Chen Jiongming, a former leader of Guangdong during the warlord era who founded the Chinese federalist movement. As he tried to escape, Chen Jiongming would die in a plane crash over Hong Kong, with no one knowing how or why his plane crashed."
liangguang_rd.22.a:0 "Good, now we can deal with more pressing matters."

liangguang_rd.23.desc:0 "As the moon rises and the sun sets, soldiers line the streets of Guangzhou, preparing to follow their orders. Silence fills the air as a figure watches on from his apartment, that figure is Chen Jiongming.

The party would promote many of reforms in the social and financial fields. With his victory, Tang now has the option to revive his old party and platform and enlighten the people of Liangguang. But he has also recieved a rather intriguing message from potential allies in Tokyo, offering him support to unify China, which will probably come with some concessions. Tang now has to make a decision, will he rebuild and modernize his country without foreign aid, or will he work with the friends in Tokyo for Pan-Asian solidarity?"

This being Sun Liren, who'd join the Anqing clique army in the 20's. But now as we have crushed his former bosses, he seeks forgiveness and a job for him. The question of whether to allow him into the army or not,  has caused quite a stir in our army command. With support from the Western Hills Group, and their allies in the Political Science factions Liren could see a return but might be stopped by the CC and Whampoa factions due to his previous connections to a now defeated warlord."

Xu Chongzhi has placed his hat into the ring, seeking to continue help boost his role as head of the guerilla leader for the RKMT. This coming as  other factions seek different options that Xu thinks will not be able to lead the revolution. Despite Xu's opposition to a new president, the Hu Hanmin's faction has nominated Lin Sen, with Lin being seen as a useful puppet for the Western Hills Group. Next with seemingly little chance is Gu Zhutong, whom is supported by the CC Clique. But one final candidate is Xiong Shihui, a member from the political science faction and its main representative in Nanning, Xiong is widely seen as a compromise candidate with his election potentially annoying all faction leaders equally."

liangguang_rd.89.desc:0 "As the drums of celebration ring across the newly unified country, the joy in Hunan is cut short as a fire has broken out across the provincial capital of Changsha. It seems the fire started off small and localized but then spread across multiple districts of the city causing damage all over. With over thousands of casualties and the destruction of the vast majority of buildings including government agency buildings such as the Civil Affairs Department, along with education and financial institutions, the public outrage is enormous. The people demand answers for the cause of such a damaging event for the Hunanese administration and economy. Privately, even the Kuomintang leadership is suspicious of the cause of the fire due to the fact that the fire seems to have started in key departments for the governance of the city. The question now is who is to lead such an investigation. Shall the NBIS be assigned to the investigation or should we choose a more familiar face to the agitated populace like local law enforcement?"
liangguang_rd.89.a:0 "This is clearly a job for the NBIS".

Yet in these observations, the accounting of investigation activity has been below proper standards. Slots of time are blotted out without proper mention of who is working and what thy are doing. Certain files that were previously there are no longer available, witness accounts thrown away for unreliablity, the list of small unusual occurrences grows and grows. With only these unprovable suspicions of incompetence, is there really a need to put the investigation under even more oversight as these inspectors claim?"
liangguang_rd.90.a:0 "Something looks fishy..."

As the report comes in, the provisional committee shows anger and disbelief. It seems that the fire was likely just caused by unfortunate circumstance. With no traces of foul play being found, the specific person who caused the fire likely via mishandling of flammable objects doesn't particularly matter. The investigation will still go on, but its unlikely anything will be found due to the chaos of the event. Still the people will want explanations even if the answer is unsatisfying."
liangguang_rd.91.a:0 "Godammit!"
liangguang_rd.92.desc:0 "As the time comes to check in on the recent results of the investigation into the cause of the Changsha fire, concerns are raised on the effectiveness of the investigation in the first place. As the report comes in, the provisional committee shows disbelief. It seems that the fire was likely caused by an anti-state organization as an attempt at sabotage. The investigation managed to aquire a note showing communication for a plan to destroy important govermental and industrial buildings. This raises more questions than answers like how they managed to inflitrate part of the government or what politics such a group has but it's unlikely there will be much to be found about the organization due to the fire. Obviously, it cannot be revealed that there's inflitration within the government to the people, so another explanation will need to be thought up. Publically, certain lax local officials will be blamed for ignoring regulations on the use of fireplaces and will be punished for their incompetence."

liangguang_rd.93.desc:0 "Though the investigation may have been delgated to local police forces, the NBIS has gone out of their way to offer manpower for the investigation and evidence that they believe to have links to the origin of the fire. With the need for a quick response to give the public, the investigation may very well need this help to be able to present any kind of case. On the other hand, accepting such help would surely harm the public image of the Changsha police due to precieved incompetence."
liangguang_rd.93.a:0 "Results matter more."
liangguang_rd.93.b:0 "Think of our reputation!"
liangguang_rd.94.desc:0 "As the time comes to check in on the recent results of the investigation into the cause of the Changsha fire, concerns are raised on the effectiveness of the investigation in the first place. As the report comes in, the provisional committee breathes a sigh of relief. It seems that the fire was likely by the misplacement of flammable objects by a few low-level officals. These officals were somehow able to be found even despite the limited amount of time to understand the chaos of the fire due to the good work of the investigation team. The NBIS was especially competent in finding witnesses who were able to grant the investigation important information. The accused confessed once it became obvious that the investigation had managed to properly piece together what had occurred right before the fire had spread. While the investigation will still go on to mop up any loose ends, it is practically a formality at this point. Once the accused are revealed to the public and tried, the people are sure to be satisfied."

In his words, Feng promises a new era encompassing a grand national revival of the Chinese nation and its people. Along with the already bribed and coereced delegates, this was enough for him to win. At the same time as the congress was coming to an end, soldiers were spotted entering government buildings to secure the transition of power.

The previous factionalism that defined the Kuomintang during its road to unification simply cannot stand, with all parties involved knowing that the conflicts boiling under the surface must rise. The Whampoa faction knows that demobilization after unification will only harm their influence. While the Western Hills Group and the CC Clique would like to make the miltary upstarts submit to proper political leadership, they also dislike each other due to the complicated history between Chiang Kai-shek and the Western Hills Group. With many opposing ideas and practices, each faction's leadership would be drastically different from another.

With his death due to cerebral hemorrhage, Hu Hanmin leaves behind a legacy of fighting for rightism in the Kuomintang.

However, there is a subset of the Whampao faction who align and are willing to work with the Western Hills Group.

But this is met with some opposition, as some people question if the Chen brothers do nothing but live in the shadow of a military leader who failed horribly in the First Northern Expedition. On the other hand, Soong is not just a representation of the late Chiang due to her personal relationship with him.

It was there were the French attempted to indoctrinate them to support their syndicalist ideology and thus subvert the goals of the national revolution. Though the French-backed forces may have been defeated, the indoctrination that those children endured has run deep. As a dedicated syndicalist, Chiang Ching-kuo had completely denounced our state and what it stands for vowing to fight to liberate the Chinese worker. It's unlikely he will ever be found with his current whereabout unknown. On the other hand, Chiang Wei-kuo was not as dedicated to the syndicalist cause as his brother was, and with their failure has come running back into our arms. Although the leadership of the party knows that he is not a biological son of Chiang Kai-shek, his repuation amongst the population will be enough to weaken any Chiangist socialists."

Li Zongren has been making pushes behind the scenes to capture more support from Chongzhi's supporters, promising a various array of "improvements" from Xu's government. In the midst of this, Xu has been plotting to remove Zongren from office seeing the ever expanding threat Zongren poses.\n\nWith preparations already in place to gift the Lis a sabotaged private plane, the question now arises of whether Xu will go through with the assassination attempt thereby putting himself at risk, or simply accept his political misfortune."

Indeed, an acceptance of the anarchist's request would grant them enormous influence, which they would likely use in alignment with the Central Club Clique.

Despite this, the party has managed to unify enough to gather up strength to set up a government. Even as the party holds up a unified mask, backroom deals to strengthen and weaken different groups continue.

Li Shizeng has called the Chinese Anarchist Conference to commence with now the direction of the anarchist revolution within China. But this has created new factional disputes with in the anarchist coalition. First is Li Shizeng's faction, the Moralists, who seek a form of moral anarchism that is based off from the ideas of Li Shizeng and Liu Shifu (who was killed in 1911). Next is Cai Yuanpei's faction, the Labourists, which are more inspired by anarcho-syndicalism from the days of Yuanpei's work with the Chinese work-study programs in France. Though distant from the Commune of France, it still retains some syndicalist ties with some similarities with the CSP despite being in disagreement with the CSP and also the KMT by extension. Third and finally, are the Individualists led by Ba Jin who promtoe a more individualist variant of anarchism which has denounce the idea of both left & right politics.\n\n§VMoralists: [?GXC.SHI_ANA]§!\n§rLabourists: [?GXC.CAI_ANA]§!\n§tIndividualists: [?GXC.JIN_ANA]§!"

 GXC_kmt_whampoa_clique_long: "Whampoa Clique (Huángpŭ jítuan)\n\n§LDuring his leadership as the headmaster of Whampoa Military Academy, the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek created a cult following amongst his right-wing students. They are also heavily influenced by the right-wing ideologue of the Kuomintang, Dai Jitao and are considered to be the far-right of the Kuomintang. With the empowerment of the right-wing of the Kuomintang organisation, the Whampoa Clique finds itself growing in strength daily as more and more radical students fall to the lure of its militaristic tone of revolution.§!\n"

 GXC_kmt_pac_long: "Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang (Zhongguo Guomindang linshi xingdong weiyuanhu)\n\n§LThe Provisional Action Committee was formed during the League War by those who supported Song Qingling in the MinGan Provisional Government and distrusted the authoritarian nature of the returned Central Committee led by Wang Jingwei. Believing in the notion of achieving total socialism by the workers and the peasantry, the PAC draws its name from its desire for the Kuomintang to take action as a revolutionary vanguard with the masses gaining revolutionary consciousness and taking action as well.\n\nThe main ideological facets of the PAC is a total social revolution through democratic land reform to reward the land to those who till it, the installation of local self-governments as a result, and the necessity for China to adopt a method of \"National Capitalism\" to transition China from a feudal society into a socialist one. While some members of PAC view the Third Internationale's extension into China as a potential threat to the native revolution practised in China, the PAC nonetheless has shown a willingness to work with members of the orthodox faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party as well as an equally beneficial relationship with the World Society. As one of the two major political cliques in the Kuomintang, the PAC seeks to enlighten the masses of China and transform the Chinese proletariat into a force of revolutionary change to entirely defeat the warlords, expel the imperialists, and fulfil the dream of Sun Yat-sen. With the Kuomintang’s right wing reestablishing itself as the dominant force in the party, the PAC has emerged as the main leftist opposition to the Generalissimo in the Central Committee.§!\n"

Upon the return of the Kuomintang's right wing and the unification of China under the KMT, they have returned as a major conservative political faction of the Kuomintang.

The RCA, led primarily by Chen Gongbo, but including the closest friends and followers of Wang Jingwei - believes that if the revolution is to be saved, it must be reorganised in the same spirit as 1924. The Kuomintang, in their eyes, must be purged of its excess democratic and reactionary forces; only then will China achieve her national revolution.\n\nOnce a secret faction amongst the Chinese expatriate community in Europe, with the return of the Central Committee, the RCA has emerged as one of the Kuomintang's two major political parties. They adhere to a model of strict leadership (seeing the Kuomintang as the vanguard of the socialist revolution) and a party for the peasantry, workers, and petite bourgeoisie. They hold warm and cordial ties with the Third Internationale, and many RCA members also hold relations with the radical wing of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Nonetheless, it is a movement that sees the Chinese Nationalist cause as not just one for China but also one for the entirety of Asia. The RCA runs on a platform that China is the socialist vanguard, spreading the revolution far and wide and liberating the oppressed peoples of Asia from the chains of imperialism. The RCA consists of two wings - the radical wing led by Chen Gongbo and a moderate wing led by Gu Mengyu - with their views differing over issues such as the nature of class struggle in China or land reform.\n\n Various setbacks and unforeseen circumstances have seen the RCA lose its once dominant position in the Central Committee to formerly marginalised right wing elements within the party. RCA members who have joined the new rightist dominated Central Committee have begrudgingly allied with PAC members to form a leftist opposition to the Generalissimo.§!\n"

The Radical faction distances itself from the moderates with their views on class struggle and Marxist historical materialism. While few members of RCA are willing to outwardly declare themselves as Marxists, their writings exhibit a strong Marxist influence and members of the radicals frequently use phrases such as \"contradiction\" and \"totality\".\n\nThe ranks of the radical faction are full of former syndicalists and they are often associated with the Chinese Syndicalist Party's radical faction. Members of the Radical faction of RCA espouse in what they believe to be a \"Materialist\" interpretation of the Three Principles' of the People - that is the belief that the Sanminzhuyi can be interpreted through the lenses of Marxism and that economic factors can be used to explore Chinese history. Sharing the views of the moderates, the Radicals do believe that a reorganisation is needed to expel the degeneracy that has pervaded into the Kuomintang. However, the party must thus be linked with the masses and that the Kuomintang has an organisation must be turned into one for the workers and peasants, - eventually becoming so ingrained that the revolution will be led by workers and peasants.

GXC_Guangxi_Warlord_Domination_desc:0 "Ma Ji's Guangxi Clique has emerged victorious in the Yue-Gui War. Continued militarisation is on the menu, that is certain. What is not certain is whether or not Guangxi will vie for national prominence or remain focused in regional politics."

GXC_Stabilize_the_Situation_desc:0 "It is clear that Guangdong does not welcome their conquerors. If we are to integrate them into our government, we will need to work with the locals and compromise with them. Stability is key, and winning the local elites over will help us in the long-run."

GXC_Expand_Nanning_Academy_desc:0 "The Nanning Military Academy dates from pre-Revolutionary times, training a large number of NCOs from Southern China, and the majority of Guangxi officers are graduates.

GXC_Lu_Rontings_Legacy_desc:0 "Lu Rongting was a brilliant man. Not only in military matters, but in personal relations and his eye for talent unmatched.

GXC_End_Labor_Movement:0 "Suppress the Labour Movement"
GXC_End_Labor_Movement_desc:0 "The labour movement in Guangdong has grown along with industrialisation, protected by Chen Jiongming's socialist policies.

After all, can these puppets of the Western Syndicalist powers be trusted in the first place?"

GXC_Philantropy:0 "Philantropy"
GXC_Philantropy_desc:0 "Chen Lianbo is a philanthropist, which has made him beloved with the people.

GXC_Merchants_Fight_Bandits_desc:0 "Banditry in Guangxi has been a thorn for the region's development. Their very presence is enough to hamper economic growth, something the Chamber of Commerce can no longer tolerate, and the Merchant Corps will ensure that trade is protected in the region."

GXC_Chinese_Washington:0 "The Chinese Washington"
GXC_Chinese_Washington_desc:0 "During the Merchant Corps Uprising, a Western commentator in Hong Kong described Chen Lianbo as the \"Chinese Washington\".

GXC_Southern_Reconstruction_Plan_desc:0 "During the 1920s, Chen Jiongming wrote an ambitious Reconstruction Plan for China, hoping to bridge the gap between the warring factions and reunite the country, and this was adopted by several other provincial governors at the time. The plan can be adapted for our allied provinces and help build up the south as a model of the benefits of federalism and democracy."

GXC_Civilian_Guangxi:0 "Restore Civilian Control in Guangxi"
GXC_Civilian_Guangxi_desc:0 "For too long, Guangxi has been controlled by power-hungry, irresponsible militarists that have sapped to province of all its wealth and happiness.

GXC_Feds_Supress_Bandits:0 "End Banditry in Guangxi"
GXC_Feds_Supress_Bandits_desc:0 "Banditry has been plaguing Guangxi since the Xinhai Revolution.

GXC_Military_Nationalization:0 "Military Nationalisation"
GXC_Military_Nationalization_desc:0 "One of the biggest problems currently plaguing China are the warlords.

GXC_Negotiate_For_Reunification_desc:0 "Chen Jiongming believes that the only way to truly unite China is through compromise and negotiation with the north, creating a lasting union instead of a hollow victory through force.

GXC_three-stage_revolution_desc:0 "Sun Yat-sen, our Party's founder, envisioned that the National Revolution would happen in three stages after the failure of the first Republic. We are still merely at the first stage, where the National Revolutionary Army must destroy the vestiges of Manchu tyranny and corruption. To this end, martial law must be enforced while the Party keeps tight control over institutions."

 GXC_provinical_unrest_desc: "Although has long had a major presence in Liangguang, particularly in their old bases in Guangdong, there are many who continue to hold loyalty to the treacherous federalists, corrupt merchants or even the wretched warlords.

The Army must be reformed, its legacy enshrined as it once again carries the torch of National Revolution."

GXC_dang_guo:0 "Dang Guo"

GXC_People_Production_Party_Plan_desc:0 "The Productive People's Party's agenda does not differ significantly from the Kuomintang's, nor does it oppose Sun Yat-sen's vision.

Although many brave comrades have fallen along the way, China has at last been saved."

 GXC_martial_law_desc: "As stated in Article 28-31, the ideas of political tutelage must be implemented during the National Reconstruction in accordance with the philosophy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

 GXC_academia_sinica: "Academia Sinica"
 GXC_academia_sinica_desc: "As part of the national reconstruction model expressed by the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Academia Sinica is the Republic's attempt to champion scholarly research and higher education ideals.

 GXC_national_monopoly: "Create Nationalised Monopolies"
 GXC_national_monopoly_desc: "China's status as a semi-colonial society harkens to the idea that China is not economically self-sufficient to be a truly free nation. As part of our National Reconstruction efforts and in accordance with the principles of the Sanminzhuyi, we will take efforts to nationalise and control all major state projects, such as the Railways, to develop a genuinely self-sufficient economy."

 GXC_extend_education: "Reach out to the Mass Movement"
 GXC_extend_education_desc: "One of the key principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Sanminzhuyi are the ideals of Minzu and Minsheng. While Minsheng, in general, has been pervaded by the left wing of the party, our interpretation still favours a mass-movement-like approach to reach out to the country's Chinese workers and peasantry and uplift them from warlordism. However, we will not solely focus on them, but encourage the notion that the KMT is a party for the masses, including the bourgeoisie."

 GXC_state_capitalism: "Adopt National Capitalism"
 GXC_state_capitalism_desc: "In his search for China's economic recovery and rebirth, Dr. Sun Yat-sen turned away from both the practices of western capitalism and Marxism, believing that there could be another way to resolve the issue of capitalism while modernising the country. Following his principles, the state will play a role in the economic planning and structuring of the country by creating coastal enclaves where foreign trade and capital can help the economy of China develop rapidly."

 GXC_economic_stabilisation: "National Reconstruction Commission"

The Three Principles shall be the basis of all schooling throughout the nation."

 GXC_new_life_movement: "Awaken the New Life Movement"
 GXC_new_life_movement_desc: "While we have completed the military phase of the revolution, there are many within the Kuomintang's right-wing that view that the government's duty to the welfare of the people is not yet complete. As corruption, pervasiveness, and hedonism permeate every aspect of Chinese society, it is up to the State to instruct and guide the nation back to their orderly roots of Confucianism and legalism to revive the ethics of the Old China that we have since lost."

 GXC_cult_of_personality: "The Cult of the Generalissimo"
 GXC_cult_of_personality_desc: "From the leader of bandits to the Generalissimo of the National Revolutionary Army, Li Zongren has become a household name throughout the country as the man who unified China under the banner of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang.

 GXC_constitution: "Ratification of the Constitution"
 GXC_constitution_desc: "Per the instructions at the end of the First National Congress, the time has come to ratify a new Constitution and to end the period of political tutelage.

 GXC_legacy_of_war_desc: "Through thick and thin, the NRA in Guangxi and Guangzhou has established itself as one of China's premier fighting forces. While it had started as merely a shattered army remnant from the Northern Expedition, it has become the army that has indeed unified the Chinese country. Let us study the tactics of the wars of unification to prepare the NRA for its future struggles."

 GXC_firepower: "Shock and Awe"
 GXC_firepower_desc: "Artillery has long been a favourite of warlord armies due to their range and ease of use, although poor coordination and equipment often led to more failures than successes. Let us study western artillery tactics and copy them, such as "creeping barrages" to develop our explosive breakthrough doctrines."

 GXC_kmt_tanks: "The New Method of War"
 GXC_kmt_tanks_desc: "During the wars of unification, very few Chinese warlord cliques or governments owned tanks - with nearly all armoured vehicles being foreign imports. As China is now unified and the industrial heartland of the country belongs to us, let us develop our own tank and armour programme. Our wars in the future will no longer be fought with the dadao and the rifle but rather by the devastating breakthrough potential of armoured units."

 GXC_kmt_central_military_academy: "Establish the Central Military Academy"
 GXC_kmt_central_military_academy_desc: "With the completion of Dr. Sun's vision, there no longer exists a need to host the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou.

This will help our central command structure and encourage recruits from all across the country to learn from the best officers China has to offer."

 GXC_integrate_the_warlords: "Integrate the Warlords"
 GXC_integrate_the_warlords_desc: "Despite the unification of the country, there exists still plenty of warlord generals and armies who have yet to lay down their arms to the central government.

 GXC_kmt_cic: "Chinese Industrial Cooperatives"
 GXC_kmt_cic_desc: "As a result of the chaos of the wars of unification and resistance, thousands of Chinese men and women find themselves either refugees or out of work. In order to make up for China's lost industrial capacity, we will organise industrial cooperatives for workers to receive voting shares and to contribute to China's growing arms industries. Not only will this encourage the masses' support of the Party but it will also help us direct much needed efforts towards reviving our arms industries."

 GXC_kmt_nra: "The Army of the Republic"
 GXC_kmt_nra_desc: "Despite the NRA's problems after the unification, we have succeeded in our reforms to modernise and equip the NRA for future conflicts. Every day, we receive new and eager recruits ready to be taught by battle-hardened veterans of the NRA. As the true army of the Chinese Republic, our armed forces shall be a testament to the success of Chinese modernisation for generations to come.

lng.1.t:0 "The Situation in Liangguang"
lng.1.d:0 "With the League of Eight Provinces falling into open warfare to secure Nanjing, Chen Jiongming, the Governor of Guangdong, announced the immediate secession of the province from the League. Denouncing the League as corrupt and unable to protect the rights and welfare of the people, he was followed suit by Governor Lu Rongting of Guangxi in the west. Accordingly, the provincial assemblies of Guangdong and Guangxi held a joint meeting in Guangzhou, electing Chen Jiongming as Extraordinary Governor-General of Liangguang.\n\nWhile the \"Two Guangs\" are united in defence against bandits, the ambition of Warlords from the disintegrating League, this new union of provinces is already proving to be struggling. The leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi are only united by pragmatism, the two having widely different aims for the region, let alone China as a whole. Lu Rongting leads a highly militarized province, while Chen leads a varied republican coalition in one of the few functioning democracies in all of China.\n\nLiangguang may avoid the bloodshed of the collapse of the League, but it will not avoid the consequences of Beijing's failure to keep China vaguely united."

lng.101.t:0 "Briefly Introducing Liangguang"
lng.101.d:0 "Liangguang, or \"Two Guangs\", is a geographical term representing the provinces of Guangxi in the west and Guangdong in the east. The Viceroyalty of Liangguang was first created during the Ming Dynasty, but would be dissolved and reformed numerous times until its final dissolution in 1911. Its official name was the lengthy \"Governor-General, Commander and Quartermaster, Supervisor of Waterways, and Inspector-General of the Two Expanses (Guangs) and Surrounding Areas\".\n\nGuangdong province is one of the most wealthy and developed parts of China, with Guangzhou rivaling Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. However, its recent history is marred with warfare and destruction, with the province losing Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan to Western imperialists in the 19th century, while the Xinhai Revolution eventually brought further ruin by numerous wars between warlords and the turbulent rule of the Kuomintang. Since the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926, the province has been governed Chen Jiongming and has seen a remarkable recovery and growth, developing a young provincial democracy in the process.\n\nGuangxi, meanwhile, has been ruled by Lu Rongting, who is seen as the quintessential warlord. The province has been highly militarized and its soldiers are well-known across China to be some of the best. However, this high level of militarization has been costly, and the wealthier Guangdong has been essentially keeping the Guangxi Army afloat, creating an interdependent relationship between the two provinces as Guangxi troops often supplement the smaller Guangdong Army."
lng.101.a:0 "Governor Chen will see us through."
lng.101.b:0 "What about all these factions?"

lng.102.t:0 "Factionalism in Liangguang"
lng.102.d:0 "While Chen Jiongming currently leads a wide coalition of republicans, the Grand Republican League, it contains numerous factions outside of his own political party.\n\nThe Public Interest Party, or Zhigongdang, was founded in 1925 by Chen Jiongming and his ally, Tang Jiyao. Its ideology can be compared to western social-democracy, wanting to improve civil and workers' rights throughout China. Mainly, however, it is the most important Federalist party in the country, calling for the Central government to be reorganized as a federal republic and multiparty democracy.\n\nThe Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu, is essentially a front-organization for the moderate-left Kuomintang in Guangdong. While also social-democratic like the Federalists, they differ as the PPP's ideology and philosophy is based on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and his teachings. Their major obstacle in working closer with the Federalists is the bad history between the two parties' founders, who violently split before the Northern Expedition.\n\nWhile not a political party, the Merchants' Public Safety Organization, the paramilitary organization of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, is highly influential. Led by Chen Lianbo, their main goal is to protect businesses and trade from bandits and irresponsible politicians. They have noticeable ties with Hong Kong and German businessmen, making them a target of local anti-concessionists as the AOG struggles to recoup their massive losses from Black Monday and the League Collapse.\n\nIn Guangxi, the provincial assembly is little but a rubber-stamping one for the Army. As such, there is little open opposition to the Guangxi Clique from political groups. The Clique's main enemies currently hide in Yunnan as Li Zongren patiently waits for his chance to strike and retake the province for his own Clique aligned with the right-wing of the Kuomintang."

As such, the two have been cooperating since the dawn of the League in the first place, working together to secure the region's autonomy from Nanjing and, consequently, Beijing.\n\nThe two governors have thus agreed to stay neutral in the conflict in the former League and focus inward instead."

Now that he has secured Southern China, he wishes to bring Liangguang back into the fold, which would give us a strong ally in a notoriously rebellious region of the country. Of course, that means he would have significant autonomy from Beijing and we will have to ensure he is protected from rivals in the region."

Seeing the Kuomintang and other warlord states as a threat to China's stability and economic development, he has been highly receptive of the Panasian idea and seeks protection. Of course, we must remember that Chen has ties with the wealthy merchants of China; he will certainly expect some concessions for his loyalty, but his support could be a significant boon to our relations with the Chinese economic elite."

lng.11.d:0 "With war and chaos raging from Shandong to Fujian due to the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, Governor-General of Liangguang, Chen Jiongming, made a speech at the Guangdong Provincial Assembly today addressing a number of issues facing the province.\n\nChen assured the Assembly that neutrality in the conflict to the northwest was the only logical way forward: The stable and prosperous province of Guangdong needed to look inward and focus on improving the province and its inhabitants' livelihoods. The people needed to show the rest of China that their provincial democracy and civilian government was a model to follow, forming a believable alternative to the monarchists in the north, the warlords throughout China and the false revolutionaries of the Kuomintang. This was, Chen believes, the only way to bring peace and unite China in the long-term and rid it of tyrants once and for all."
lng.11.a:0 "Towards a Free China!"

lng.12.t:0 "Governor Chen Criticised in the Assembly"
lng.12.d:0 "Chen Jiongming is a staunch believer in democracy and the Guangdong Provincial Assembly is one of the few truly democratic legislatures in Asia, let alone China. Of course, this means that the Assembly is not only a place to represent the people, debate and enact policy, but also criticise the government.\n\nWith recent decisions made by Chen Jiongming's government to seek support from the gentry to the detriment of his promised land reform, a socialist member of the Assembly was quick criticise the Governor's decision, calling him out on this contradictory decision. This has hurt the Governor's credibility in the eyes of the people and strenghtened the radicals' popularity."
lng.12.a:0 "Such is democracy."

lng.13.t:0 "Peasants Request Financial Aid"
lng.13.d:0 "The province of Guangdong has not been spared from the consequences of Black Monday, regardless of how unwanted German influence is. The peasants have been hit particularly hard as they struggle with the decline of price for rice and grain. Elected representatives from the rural districts arrived at the Provincial Assembly to make their case, requesting financial aid to weather the storm.\n\nChen Jiongming, receiving considerable support from the peasants and rural landowners through his government policies, certainly wants to accept, but the financial situation of the province may make such a program impossible to implement and finance."
lng.13.a:0 "Help them, of course."
lng.13.b:0 "An unfortunate impossibility."

lng.14.t:0 "Merchant Bailouts?"
lng.14.d:0 "Similarly to the peasants' crisis last month, a number of wealthy merchants have hit serious financial difficulties caused by the global economic crisis. A number of members of the Provincial Assembly with ties to the merchant class of the cities and towns have made the case that the provincial government should intervene and keep these merchants from economic ruin. The influence of the merchants in Guangdong is significant and their continued political support is essential, but such a bailout would, of course, be costly."
lng.14.a:0 "Bail them out."
lng.14.b:0 "They can fend for themselves."

lng.15.t:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
lng.15.d:0 "The armies of Guangxi and Guangdong were, until recently, under separate commands. To further improve cohesion between units and officers of the two provincial armies, military exercises have been held fairly regularly. While this had significant benefits for both armies, these exercises have made it more and more obvious of how superior in quality the Guangxi Army is over its Guangdong counterpart. Even if the former is essentially subsidised by the latter's government, the manoeuvres have been, so far, excellent opportunities for the Governor of Guangxi to show off his province's military prowess."
lng.15.a:0 "Guangdong finances, Guangxi fights."

lng.16.t:0 "Suppressing Illegal Gambling"
lng.16.d:0 "Even since entering politics in the years before the Xinhai Revolution, Chen Jiongming has been fighting an arduous battle against gambling in the province, a problem plaguing the province along with opium addiction. In the 1920s, he managed to have it completely banned. Just as with banning the trade and consumption of opium, however, enforcing this ban has been a difficult task and removed an important source of revenue for the government. The Provincial Assembly recently began debating its effectiveness, with a faction pushing for loosening anti-gambling laws.\n\nThe Governor is adamant that this would lead to a return to moral degeneracy in Guangdong along with increased corruption without truly decreasing crime, while his opponents in the Assembly claim that the laws are wasteful and impossible to enforce, instead pushing for its re-legalisation and re-establishment of gambling taxes.\n\nGuangdong is, of course, a democracy, and the Provincial Assembly will vote on the matter."

For his part, Chen reminded his opponents that his proposal for China differed significantly from the American system, and was quick to make parallels between the current states of China and the United States: Its presidential system puts too much power in the hands of the President compared to the legislature, making it no different to the current \"constitutional\" monarchy of China, while comparing \"demagogues\" such as Long and Haywood to Sun Yat-sen and Wang Jingwei - both of which are destabilising or suppressing the democratic institutions of the nation.\n\nWhile Chen Jiongming maintains that the failure of America is not inherently due to federalism or democracy, the argument made obvious the doubts that many people feel towards his proposal."

Inspired by the riots further north, the Guangzhou anti-concessionists made their own demonstrations in the city's German quarters, which quickly turned into riots. Local police turned a blind eye while several German businesses were damaged and a German citizen was attacked and wounded. The situation was only calmed with the intervention of the Merchant Corps, which managed to disperse the demonstrators.\n\nChen Jiongming, while calling for calm, openly sympathized with the anti-concessionists and criticized both the Unequal Treaties and Beijing's inaction.\n\nThe bold statement was well-received by the people, but some cannot shake the feeling that imperialist reprisals are already on their way."

In response, the Admiralty is preparing to retaliate by sending a squadron of destroyers to attack Guangzhou and remind the Chinese that the German Empire will not tolerate such a blatant violation of international treaties.\n\nOf course, there is no real strategic or tactical value to such an attack on a defenceless city, but it would send a message and ensure that the Chinese people and the rest of the world do not forget that Germany is a world power."

While his rule was disputed by Li Zongren, in exile in Yunnan, Lu kept Guangxi relatively stable and maintained its regional identity.\n\nWith Ma Ji securing control over the Guangxi Clique, cooperation between the two cliques of Liangguang now appears tenuous as the ambitious new warlord plots to increase his power in southern China."
lngcivilwar.1.a:0 "Worrying."

lnggxwar.1.t:0 "Li Zongren Invades!"
lnggxwar.1.d:0 "Baise, a city which controls the mountain pass connecting Guangxi with Yunnan and Vietnam, was attacked by Li Zongren, a right-wing general of the KMT, quickly overwhelming local defences. Our scouts report that the warlord has split his forces, part of it preparing to go down the Pearl River to attack Nanning, and another heading to Wuzhou to cut off Guangxi forces. Li, taking advantage of Lu Rongting's recent passing, clearly hopes to dislodge the current Guangxi Clique and take the province for himself once and for all in the name of the Kuomintang.\n\nMa Ji wants to attack Li in Baise before he has a chance to consolidate and move to Nanning, while Lu Yugang wants to head north and keep Nanning from getting encircled. However, Lin Hu, one of our officers, suggests we instead fortify Nanning, claiming that our Guangdong ally won't allow Wuzhou to fall and that Li should be forced to dislodge them."
lnggxwar.1.a:0 "Take the fight to Li!"
lnggxwar.1.b:0 "Defend Wuzhou, we cannot be encircled!"
lnggxwar.1.c:0 "Let them come to us!"

lnggxwar.2.t:0 "Wuzhou falls; Ma struggles in Baise"
lnggxwar.2.d:0 "As expected, Wuzhou fell to Li's troops as they followed the opium trail down the Pearl River. While Li was not expecting Ma's aggressive counter-attack, his army is well-trained and they are putting a stiff fight and Ma requested reinforcements. On the other hand, Lu is worried that the enemy force in Wuzhou is exposing his flank and cutting him off from Guangdong, putting the entire province in danger if Guangdong doesn't react soon."
lnggxwar.2.a:0 "Ma Ji needs help; send reinforcements!"
lnggxwar.2.b:0 "We must secure our flank in Wuzhou first."

lnggxwar.3.t:0 "Li Zongren Defeated!"
lnggxwar.3.d:0 "After a long and bloody fight, Lu Yugang's timely arrival forced the invading warlord to retreat. Both cliques have suffered heavy losses, but Ma Ji stands victorious, his position in Guangxi now secured from his external rival."
lnggxwar.3.a:0 "Victory at a cost."

lnggxwar.4.t:0 "Li Zongren Victorious"
lnggxwar.4.d:0 "Without help, Ma Ji was defeated in Baise, suffereing heavy losses before being mercilessly pursued. Meanwhile, Lu Yugang was unable to dislodge Li's forces in Wuzhou and was forced to retreat back to Nanning, only to be destroyed on the way. With the Old Guangxi Clique destroy, Li Zongren is now undisputedly Governor of Guangxi, giving the right-wing of the KMT a base of operation."
lnggxwar.4.a:0 "A New Guangxi Clique."

lnggxwar.5.t:0 "Distraction!"
lnggxwar.5.d:0 "Li Zongren's attack on Wuzhou was merely a distraction meant to split Guangxi forces. With Wuzhou easily defended, Li attacked and handily defeated Ma Ji's forces in the city. With the bulk of Guangxi forces under his command, Lu Yugang will have to retake Nanning by force, where Li has the advantage. Alternatively, he could head west to try and encircle him by taking back Baise. Of course, there is always the option to retreat to friendly Guangdong and dislodge the invaders with their help."
lnggxwar.5.a:0 "Head back to retake Nanning!"
lnggxwar.5.b:0 "Genius! Head west and cut him off!"
lnggxwar.5.c:0 "The war is lost, retreat!"

lnggxwar.6.t:0 "Lu Yugang Repulsed"
lnggxwar.6.d:0 "Lu Yugang's attempt to retake Nanning from Li Zongren, who had time to fortify his position, has failed. Unsurprisingly, what is left of Guangxi's forces have defected to Li's new clique, further empowering his right-KMT movement."
lnggxwar.6.a:0 "Li Zongren secures Guangxi."

lnggxwar.7.t:0 "Disintegration of the Guangxi Clique"
lnggxwar.7.d:0 "In the attempt to go up the Hongshui River, a tributary of the Pearl River, and cut off the invaders by retaking Baise, Lu Yugang's force have desintegrated as they were quickly cut-off and destroyed near the city of Laibin. The Old Guangxi Clique is no more and its remnants have joined up with the new clique, securing Guangxi for Li Zongren's right-wing faction of the KMT."
lnggxwar.7.a:0 "Li Zongren is victorious."

lnggxwar.8.t:0 "Wuzhou Falls; Li Zongren Approaches"
lnggxwar.8.d:0 "News has reached Nanning that Wuzhou fell to a small task force under one of Li Zongren's subordinates, while Li himself is marching down towards Nanning. While Lu Yugang and others are critical of our inaction and are nervous about being cut-off from Guangdong, Ma Ji believes that their opportunity to attack is long gone and they must further fortify the city. He also believes that Li has no choice but to attack as soon as possible or else risk intervention from Guangdong, while Lu counters that Guangdong will not act unless the road to Nanning is open."
lnggxwar.8.a:0 "Send a small force to Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.8.b:0 "Dig in."

lnggxwar.9.t:0 "Attack on Wuzhou Repulsed; Nanning Falls"
lnggxwar.9.d:0 "Not only has the small force to retake Nanning failed against an entrenched enemy, Nanning has fallen to Li Zongren's relentless assault on the city. The new clique's victory was costly, however, with significant damage to the city. Despite a low number of defections to his forces, Li Zongren has secured Guangxi for the rightist KMT."
lnggxwar.9.a:0 "A costly victory for the New Guangxi Clique"

lnggxwar.10.t:0 "Battle of Nanning"
lnggxwar.10.d:0 "Ma Ji was proven right as Li Zongren's assault on the capital of Guangxi commenced almost as soon as he arrived. Facing the full force of the Guangxi Clique, he was unable to dislodge them from their fortified positions and suffered heavy losses. When it was clear to Li that the clique had not fallen for his diversion and that he faced a disadvantageous situation, he retreated, and Ma Ji now has the chance to destroy Li's threat once and for all. However, with a portion of Li's force heading to Wuzhou as well, more cautious officers advise that they could regroup and cause trouble as bandits later, suggesting that we ask help from Guangdong to mop up Li's forces in and around Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.10.a:0 "Request help from Guangdong."
lnggxwar.10.b:0 "Pursue Li on our own."

lnggxwar.11.t:0 "Li Zongren Defeated"
lnggxwar.11.d:0 "With Guangxi forces pursuing him, Li Zongren's retreat has become more and more disorganised and turned into a rout. The invader's own whereabouts are currently unknown, but what is certain is that he is no longer a threat to Guangxi and the clique's rule is once again secure."
lnggxwar.11.a:0 "A decisive victory!"

lnggxwar.12.t:0 "Chen Mingshu's Decision"
lnggxwar.12.d:0 "Up until now, the Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu and representing the majority of members of the Kuomintang in Liangguang, has been collaborating with Chen Jiongming's big-tent republican coalition. The Nationalists were happy to help develop and participate in democratic institutions in order to protect their interests and legacy after the failed Northern Expedition. This was with the long-term goal of peacefully implementing Mínquán, Sun Yat-sen's Principle of popular government. Besides, Chen's Federalists protected them from Zhili and Qing retribution.\n\nLi Zongren's seizure of Guangxi has completely changed the situation. While Chen Mingshu hardly trusts the rightist warlord despite both being members of the KMT, a golden opportunity presents itself: If he could get rid of Chen Jiongming, Liangguang would be secured for the Nationalist Party without bloodshed. He remains hesitant to betray him, however, after over a decade of protection and cooperation. Still, the Party's Central Committee has hatched a plan: Seize key buildings in Guangzhou and force Chen Jiongming, who has strong misgivings about fighting in the city, to surrender.\n\nAll Chen Mingshu has to do is give the order."
lnggxwar.12.a:0 "Li is but an untrustworthy bandit."
lnggxwar.12.b:0 "Start the operation."

lnggxwar.13.t:0 "KMT Seizes Guangzhou"
lnggxwar.13.d:0 "Early in the morning, under the cover of the general mobilization against Guangxi, armed members of the KMT began seizing key buildings around the city, including the Guangdong University and the Provincial Assembly Building. Soon, Chen Mingshu announced the formation of the Guangdong People's Government, the deposition of Chen Jiongming, and a call for peace with Guangxi province.\n\nAs expected, Chen Jiongming announced that, while he refused to recognize the new government, he refused to allow the city to suffer unnecessary bloodshed and destruction. He and his close supporters left for Hong Kong later that day, leaving the city in the hands of the Nationalist Party."
lnggxwar.13.a:0 "Bloodshed avoided."

lngcivilwar.2.t:0 "Lu Ronting's Funeral"
lngcivilwar.2.d:0 "Governor-General Chen Jiongming has been invited to former governor Lu Ronting's funeral as a guest of honour by the leadership of Guangxi. A traditional affair, Chen accepted the offer, hoping to foster greater unity between the two provinces in such trying times."
lngcivilwar.2.a:0 "A show of unity."

lngcivilwar.3.t:0 "Guarding the Body"
lngcivilwar.3.d:0 "As part of Chinese funeral traditions, Lu Rongting's body is on display at the former governor's residence, with family and close friends watching over the deceased. While Governor-General Chen and some close associates were part of the guard for the day, unknown assailants approached him, brandishing handguns. A firefight quickly ensued."
lngcivilwar.3.a:0 "The entourage is gunned down."
lngcivilwar.3.b:0 "The assailants fail and lay dead."

lngcivilwar.4.t:0 "Assassination of Chen Jiongming"
lngcivilwar.4.d:0 "Unable to react in time, Governor-General Chen Jiongming and his associates were gunned down by assassins under orders from Governor Ma Ji of Guangxi. News reached Guangdong quickly as Guangxi rapidly mobilised against them, but a question remains in the minds of the eastern province's leadership: Who will succeed Chen Jiongming as governor of Guangdong?\n\nChen Mingshu is an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. While not opposed to the KMT in Fujian, he resents Wang Jingwei's authoritarian leadership of the party, being a more genuine believer in democracy than a number of party members.\n\nChen Lianbo is head of the Merchant Corps, the militia of the Chinese merchant class of Guangzhou. He has been an early opponent to the late Chen Jiongming's more socialistic and populist policies and wishes to protect the merchants' interests in the region first and foremost."
lngcivilwar.4.a:0 "Chen Mingshu"
lngcivilwar.4.b:0 "Chen Lianbo"

lngcivilwar.5.t:0 "Failed Attempt on Governor Chen"
lngcivilwar.5.d:0 "Reacting in time to their assailants, Chen Jiongming and his associates managed to escape unscathed. It was quickly realised that they were under Guangxi Governor Ma Ji and they quickly made their way out of Nanning. By the time they reached Guangdong, the Guangxi clique had already mobilised their armies, ready to take leadership of Liangguang by force. Upon his return, Governor-General Chen made an impromptu speech to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, rallying them against the tyranical warlord of Guangxi and to defend their hard-earned liberties."
lngcivilwar.5.a:0 "The Dyarchy falls."

lngcivilwar.6.t:0 "The Second Guangdong-Guangxi War"
lngcivilwar.6.d:0 "The Dyarchy has fallen as the two provinces have been unable to settle their differences diplomatically. The new warlord of Guangxi is unwilling to recognise Guangdong's supremacy over Liangguang and his ambitions cannot coexist with the ideals of his eastern counterpart. Both cliques have now taken up arms; Liangguang's future will thus be settled on the battlefield."
lngcivilwar.6.a:0 "[GXC.GetLeader] will prevail!"
lngcivilwar.6.b:0 "Guangxi will take over!"

lngcivilwar.7.t:0 "Mobilisation of the Merchant Corps"
lngcivilwar.7.d:0 "The Canton Merchants' Public Safety Organization, simply known as the Merchant Corps, has mobilised their militia to help us put down the Guangxi rebels. With their interests in both provinces in danger, the merchants of Guangzhou has cast their lot on our side, giving us control over one of southern China's best troops."
lngcivilwar.7.a:0 "Their support is welcome."

lngcivilwar.8.t:0 "Mobilisation of the Rural Militia"
lngcivilwar.8.d:0 "A large part of both Guangxi and Guangdong's Militia Corps is under the command of the rural gentry. With their interests endangered by the ongoing conflict between the two provinces, the gentry has decided to fully support us and their militia are now under our command."
lngcivilwar.8.a:0 "A needed boost to our numbers."

lngcivilwar.9.t:0 "Rebel AI Guangxi Wins"
lngcivilwar.9.d:0 "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."

lngcivilwar.10.d:0 "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."
lngcivilwar.10.a:0 "Okay."

lngcivilwar.11.t:0 "Rebel AI Guangxi Wins way too quickly"
lngcivilwar.11.d:0 "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."
lngcivilwar.11.a:0 "Okay."

lngcivilwar.12.d:0 "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."
lngcivilwar.12.a:0 "Okay."

lngcivilwar.13.t:0 "Ma Ji Secures Lianggang"
lngcivilwar.13.d:0 "The warlord of Guangxi is victorious over the Guangdong rebels. With the two Guangs secured, Ma Ji is now able to push his ambitions towards the rest of southern China and beyond."
lngcivilwar.13.a:0 "Guangxi's power grows."

lngcivilwar.14.t:0 "Chen Lianbo Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.14.d:0 "The head of the Merchant Corps, Chen Lianbo, has secured the General-Governorship of Liangguang after defeating the Guangxi rebels. Without a doubt, the new governor will focus on economic development and the protection of the Chinese merchants' interests in the region above all."
lngcivilwar.14.a:0 "Prosperity first."

lngcivilwar.15.t:0 "Chen Mingshu Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.15.d:0 "Chen Mingshu, head of the Productive Peoples' Party and former Kuomintang member, has defeated the Guangxi rebels and secured control of Liangguang. As Governor-General, Chen will likely align the provinces towards the KMT in Fujian and is known to support Soong Ching-ling's faction there."
lngcivilwar.15.a:0 "Another victory for the KMT!"

lngcivilwar.16.t:0 "Chen Jiongming Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.16.d:0 "Despite internal opposition and the revolt of the Guangxi Clique, Chen Jiongming has remained at the head of Liangguang. With his rule and popularity more secure than ever, he will have the ability to push further towards his ideals should the situation in the rest of the region allow it: A federal and truly democratic China."
lngcivilwar.16.a:0 "Chen will free China!"

lngcivilwar.17.t:0 "Reintegration of the Rebel Army"
lngcivilwar.17.d:0 "For the most part, the soldiers and even generals of warlord or provincial armies tended to be more concerned about defending their homes from invaders and bandits rather than matters of national importance. As such, we can reintegrate the rebel army with relative ease once their treacherous leaders are deal with. After all, they are fellow Chinese. Even if they previously served the wrong master, they can still redeem themselves or return to their homes."
lngcivilwar.17.a:0 "They will now serve a greater purpose."

lngcivilwar.18.t:0 "Old Guangxi Clique Seeks Asylum"
lngcivilwar.18.d:0 "Ma Ji and Lu Yugang, leaders of the clique that formerly ruled Guangxi, have fled their homes after a power struggle. The two are old friends that once served under us during the war with the Kuomintang and they have asked to serve in our armed forces after being forced out of Guangxi, perhaps seeking a way to restore their rule someday."
lngcivilwar.18.a:0 "They will have to find a new home elsewhere."
lngcivilwar.18.b:0 "Of course, these old friends are welcome."

lngcivilwar.19.t:0 "Fate of Guangdong"
lngcivilwar.19.d:0 "Now that Guangdong is under our control, we must choose who will replace the previous provincial government. The top brass of the Clique is arguing for total exploitation of the developed province in order to fuel Guangxi's own development and, more important, fund an increasingly large and modern army. Of course, this is arguably rather short-sighted, and more politically-knowledgeable members of the Clique argue that we should hand over the provincial governments to the local elites so that the province isn't sucked dry."
lngcivilwar.19.a:0 "Exploit them!"
lngcivilwar.19.b:0 "We must be careful- let the locals handle it."

lngcivilwar.20.t:0 "Li Zongren Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.20.d:0 "Li Zongren, an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, managed to take over Liangguang by force. Unlike the KMT in Fujian, Li is a member of the party's right-wing, which was thought to have been purged by the left-wing along with Hu Hanmin's execution in 1925. The left-wing of the Kuomintang, until now uncontested leaders of the Nationalists, now have a very real threat to the Party's leadership."
lngcivilwar.20.a:0 "The real KMT has returned."

lngcivilwar.21.t:0 "Provincial KMT Leader Meet"
lngcivilwar.21.d:0 "With Chen Mingshu as governor of Guangdong and Li Zongren having ousted the Old Guangxi Clique, the two governors have met to discuss the future of Liangguang. The two men are essentially members of the Kuomintang, but are aligned with different factions within the party. Chen is aligned with Soong's Minquan faction while Li is de facto leader of the right-wing. While the two have differing views on how to proceed with the National Revolution, they both agree that they must form a unified government to secure the Party's position in southern China and have asked its members in the two provinces to choose their new regional leader."
lngcivilwar.21.a:0 "Chen Mingshu will fight for democracy."
lngcivilwar.21.b:0 "Unification at all costs with Li Zongren."

lngcivilwar.22.t:0 "Bai Chongxi Departs for Guangxi"
lngcivilwar.22.d:0 "Bai Chongxi left Yunnan earlier today with his men to join with his brother-in-arms, Li Zongren, in Guangxi. The latter recently became leader of the province after a power struggle with the previous clique in charge and is now in charge of the Kuomintang's right-wing in Nanning. Bai Chongxi has always been loyal to him first and foremost, and his departure was expected and unchallenged."
lngcivilwar.22.a:0 "Best of luck, I suppose."

lngcivilwar.24.t:0 "New Guangxi Clique Returns"
lngcivilwar.24.d:0 "Li Zongren's Clique was defeated in Guangxi and was forced into hiding. With Yunnan safely in the hands of the Kuomintang, they have returned, hoping to continue the fight with us and pledge their support and abilities to the National Revolutionary Army."
lngcivilwar.24.a:0 "Their revolution continues here."

lngraids.1.t:0 "Raiding German Indochina"
lngraids.1.d:0 "As the Germans are busy maintaining order in their colony, their border with us remains relatively unprotected. This makes them a prime target to raid, especially as they have poorly-defended outposts all over northern Indochina where we can easily grab supplies and equipment."
lngraids.1.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.1.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.2.t:0 "Raiding Indochina"
lngraids.2.d:0 "As the Indochinese War was a recent ordeal that they are still recovering from, Indochina remains a good target for raiding. There is bound to be equipment from the war that we can recover and salvage with little fear of resistance from exhausted Indochinese forces."
lngraids.2.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.2.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.3.t:0 "Raiding Yunnan"
lngraids.3.d:0 "The leaders of Yunnan Province have been our rivals for decades now. Their forces are formidable, but not perfect. The border between Yunnan and Guangxi is mountainous, which makes sneaking it a relatively simply affair."
lngraids.3.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.3.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.4.t:0 "Raiding Hunan"
lngraids.4.d:0 "Hunan has seen its fair share of trouble since the collapse of the League. While relatively stable, there are numerous factions vying for power and none of them are friendly to us. While they are distracted by internal affairs, we should strike."
lngraids.4.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.4.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.5.t:0 "Raiding the Nationalists"
lngraids.5.d:0 "The Nationalists have been a thorn to stability in China, which works in our favour. Their radicalism makes them inherently unstable, and we can strike them at any time as they struggle to achieve their deluded ideals."
lngraids.5.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.5.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.6.t:0 "Raiding the League"
lngraids.6.d:0 "The League is weak. Always was, always will be. The further from Nanjing, the easier it is for us to send raiders in, taking advantage of their internal dissention to acquire some more advanced hardware they themselves acquired from the German imperialists."
lngraids.6.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.6.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.7.t:0 "Raiding the International Concessions"
lngraids.7.d:0 "The imperialist Legations have been a constant symbol of humiliation for the Chinese people. Finding volunteers to send into their protected zones will be easy, and there are plenty of locals more than happy to support them against the westerners."
lngraids.7.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.7.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.8.t:0 "Raiding the German Concessions"
lngraids.8.d:0 "The blatantly-illegal consessions of the AOG are a great target for our raiders: The locals hate them, they have quality equipment for us to seize, and their defence forces are spread thin and unreliable. Raiding them is not only justified, but righteous."
lngraids.8.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.8.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.9.t:0 "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.9.d:0 "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all. We know that they have already stolen military equipment from us, and intervening might be fruitless anyways, but it is clear that local forces will struggle to repel the raids. Regardless of whether we send troops in to help or not, we will have to secure our borders or the raids will continue."
lngraids.9.a:0 "Send reinforcements."
lngraids.9.b:0 "The local defenses will have to make due."

lngraids.10.t:0 "Raid Unsuccessful"
lngraids.10.d:0 "Our raiders returned empty-handed today. A combination of poor recon and local defenses had forced them to retreat without reaching their objective. While they have failed, they have all returned safe and sound without alerting enemy forces."
lngraids.10.a:0 "Too bad."

lngraids.11.t:0 "Failed Bandit Attack"
lngraids.11.d:0 "Bandits attacked one of our isolated military outposts by the border earlier today. Our troops, thankfully, managed to pull together and utterly destroy them despite the odds. These fools are certainly not returning anytime soon after our glorious forces dealt them such a crushing defeat. Sadly, we could not find out if they were acting under orders or simply bandits desperate for resources."

lngraids.12.t:0 "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.12.d:0 "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by a large band raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all.

lngraids.14.t:0 "Disastrous Raid"
lngraids.14.d:0 "Our raiders were utterly defeated by local enemy troops, forcing us to retreat with serious losses. We will certainly not be able to attack them again anytime soon."
lngraids.14.a:0 "Damn!"

lngraids.15.t:0 "Very Successful Raid"
lngraids.15.d:0 "Our daring raid has borne fruit. Not only did they totally crush local resistance, but our raiders left with a large amount of equipment, including a number of artillery pieces. This will definitely help us reinforce our own armies while our enemies lay humiliated."

 lngkmt.5.d: "Immediately after the proclamation came dissenting voices. The local elites of Liangguang, mainly the Gentry of the countryside and the Merchants of Guangzhou, have voiced their misgivings in a new Northern Expedition. The first one was an abject failure, with Chiang Kai-shek failing to fulfil Sun Yat-sen's dreams and the Kuomintang sapping the South of all its wealth and prosperity. The failure is quite vivid in the people's memory; the Gentry is weary of the Kuomintang's history of expropriation of demands for land reform while the Merchants keenly remember their violent purging in the Merchants' Corps Incident in 1924. The commander-in-chief is confident that the Gentry can be reassured in a timely manner, but the Merchants are far more hostile and demanding; dealing with them will likely require some sacrifices."
 lngkmt.5.a: "They will toe the line soon enough."

 lngkmt.6.t: "Beginning of Political Tutelage"
 lngkmt.6.d: "Political Tutelage is the second stage in Sun Yat-sen's Three Stages of the National Revolution. With the country reunited, the National Revolutionary Army will begin to loosen their grip on power, while the Party will cement its own. This way, the Kuomintang will continue to guide China towards the third and final stage and become a democratic republic. However, for this to succeed, the people must be educated so that they understand their civic duties and rights and participate in public institutions. This is to create a healthy democracy and avoid the failures of the Xinhai Revolution."
 lngkmt.6.a: "China will be free. Eventually."

 lngkmt.7.t: "Appointing a Premier"
 lngkmt.7.d: "Generalissimo Li Zongren should not be directing the National Revolution alone. As part of the reforms to create a government as outlined by Sun Yat-sen, an Executive Yuan, one of the five branches of government, will be appointed. This council will essentially act as a cabinet and its President as head of government in Western terms (as such, the President of the Executive Yuan is known as the \"Premier\" in the West).\n\nTwo choices have been presented to the Generalissimo to preside the Executive Yuan: Sun Fo, Sun Yat-sen's son, is seen as a natural candidate to reunify the factionalised Party, and Zhu Peide, one of the NRA's leaders and prominent member of the party's moderate right-wing. The first would help heal the divide within the Nationalist Party, while the second would maintain the National Revolutionary Army's political influence and the right-wing's leading role."
 lngkmt.7.a: "Sun Fo will bring unity."
 lngkmt.7.b: "Zhu Peide from the moderate right and the NRA."

 lngkmt.8.t: "Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan"
 lngkmt.8.d: "The Legislative Yuan is one of the five branches of the Republic of China's government. Currently, the body is appointed by the Chairman, Li Zongren, and acts as the country's legislature. It is assumed that when Political Tutelage ends, the body will become a proper parliament of sorts with its members elected by the people.\n\nA preparatory session opened today discussing this possibility. Debate is expected to be fierce for many members are hoping to introduce elections next year, while others do not believe that Political Tutelage should end yet and wish to postpone the decision for next year."
 lngkmt.8.a: "Announce elections for next year!"
 lngkmt.8.b: "The next Yuan will be appointed."

 lngkmt.9.t: "Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan"
 lngkmt.9.d: "The Legislative Yuan is one of the five branches of the Republic of China's government. Currently, the body is appointed by the Chairman, Li Zongren, and acts as the country's legislature. It is assumed that when Political Tutelage ends, the body will become a proper parliament of sorts with its members elected by the people.\n\nAnother preparatory session opened today discussing this possibility. Last year, the decision to elect a Legislative Yuan was delayed. A year has passed already and the debate is renewed: Should the Legislative Yuan be elected next year, or delayed once more?"
 lngkmt.9.a: "Announce elections for next year!"
 lngkmt.9.b: "Delay for another year."
 lngkmt.9.c: "Delay indefinitely."

 lngkmt.10.t: "First Election of the Legislative Yuan"
 lngkmt.10.d: "The time has come. Political Tutelage is coming to an end and the next Legislative Yuan is to be elected by the people. While political activity outside of the Kuomintang remains limited, the Kuomintang's left-of-centre faction is campaigning fiercely for further reforms, adding a layer of democratic pluralism unseen in China for a long time."
 lngkmt.10.a: "The Centre-Right is strengthened."
 lngkmt.10.b: "The Centre-Left gains a foothold."

 lngkmt.11.t: "The Elections of [GetYear]"
 lngkmt.11.d: "As another election approaches the party-state, the functionaries and party bosses in the Kuomintang scurry to at least go through the motions of practicing democratic processes. At [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], recently elected delegates of the national assembly prepare to vote for the President of the Republic. With the KMT holding virtually every seat in the assembly since last year's legislative election, there was little doubt about who would win. To maintain appearances, [ROOT.GetLeader] has encouraged Sun Fo to run a token opposition campaign, however in the end the outcome was in little doubt. By a major landslide, the voters chose..."
 lngkmt.11.a: "The status quo is strengthened."
 lngkmt.11.b: "Reformists are strengthened."

 lngkmt.12.t: "Request from the Central Committee"
 lngkmt.12.d: "The reorganised Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou has sent a simple request that we rejoin their ranks. This means putting ourselves under their command and supervision. For the good of the nation, of course."
 lngkmt.12.a: "Of course. For the Republic!"
 lngkmt.12.b: "This is encroaching on our autonomy!"

 lngkmt.13.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Refuses our Request"
 lngkmt.13.d: "The treacherous dogs in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to comply! They have essentially refused to recognise the authority of the Central Committee and they shall receive the punishment befitting traitors."
 lngkmt.13.a: "They will pay."

 lngkmt.14.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Rejoins the Central Committee"
 lngkmt.14.d: "Our friends in [FROM.GetNameDef] have, of course, accepted our request and have rejoined our ranks."
 lngkmt.14.a: "For the Republic!"

 lngkmt.19.t: "Status of the Temples in Guangdong"
 lngkmt.19.d: "A famous story amongst the schoolchildren of Guangdong is how Sun Yat-sen vandalised an image of the patron deity of his hometown in Xiangshan county. Yet as the Nationalists bicker over the status and regime of Guangdong, the question of religion persists. Some are eager to move away from the imperial past where deity worship served to integrate the state and society.\n\nModern concepts such as evolution and rationalism have indeed entered Guangdong society, and there is no doubt that much of the city’s administration believes that Guangdong should take its place as a “model province” - one that displays modernity and westernisation in comparison to the backward cities of the warlords and the Qing. But temples and religious rituals have been a part of Chinese traditions for centuries, and the outward removal of such would undoubtedly spark dissent among the local population. In imperial China, the city god played an essential role in urban administration - the city god was considered a co-ruler of the city. For example, in Guangzhou, officials made their way to the City God Temple to invoke blessings such as rain or protection from ghosts.\n\nBut for the Kuomintang, the jointly ruled cities are a fabrication of the past, a physical depiction of the backwardness that has plagued China into a century of humiliation. To the modernists, the temples are a place of ignorance and disorder - the “old China” that must be destroyed. However, for the ordinary people of China, these temples carry a significant meaning of cultural and religious pride and significance. Businesses such as fortune-telling are held here, and even disputes are mediated by the city god. The temple was the centre of community life, and to simply eradicate them would undoubtedly earn the wrath of the populace."
 lngkmt.19.a: "Out with the Old!"
 lngkmt.19.b: "We are not going to destroy our own temples!"

 lngkmt.20.t: "The Opium Dens of Guangzhou"
 lngkmt.20.d: "The stench of opium permeates throughout all of China, the cursed plant that has brought nothing but an addiction. While not as prevalent as in other parts of China, opium has perverted itself into Guangdong society and culture. Often depicted as dank halls of infamy, the reality is that the opium houses of Guangzhou are pretty fashionable - clean and nice-looking buildings for the elite to partake in. From the lowest of the coolie to the elite, opium smoking is a popular socialite pastime in Guangdong. Considered premier entertainment venues, the 500+ opium houses are undoubtedly a part of the fabric that makes up Guangzhou. Opium houses ranged from shady dens to the high-class “Gaodeng tanhuaguan” fitted with modern amenities such as radios, heaters, and electric fans.\n\nThe sale of raw opium and permits of possession of opium constitutes a form of indispensable revenue for Guangzhou. As the [ROOT.GetAdjective] regime solidifies their control of Guangzhou; they will be in control of the opium houses. And yet, despite the profit and temptation, opium certainly has its enemies. Anti opium organisations such as the Woman’s Anti Drug Association and the Guangzhou branch of the National Anti-Opium Association clamour to eradicate the drug that has had China hooked. Suppression of the houses would certainly spark dissent but would be the first step in defeating the menace; however, keeping the houses would earn provide us with a great source of income..."
 lngkmt.20.a: "We will not have this poison in our city!"
 lngkmt.20.b: "Leave them alone, we need the funds."

 lngkmt.21.t: "Chinese High Tea"
 lngkmt.21.d: "The concept of Dim Sum originates in Guangdong province as a popular form of breakfast or lunch. Dim sum refers to small dishes that “lightly touch your heart without filling your stomach,” while “yum cha” is the practice of drinking tea. Arriving in China during the Song Dynasty, the practice of dim sum has incorporated influences from not just China but also around the world. Up until the 1920s, however, the practice of yum cha and consuming dim sum was only a privilege allocated to the elite and wealthy. Customers to high-end pavilions would inspect tea leaves to verify their temperature and quality to dine in privacy and comfort.\n\nHowever, nowadays, the practice of dim sum has extended to people with average incomes, students, and government employees. Indeed Guangzhou’s teahouse culture has led to the creation of chefs with celebrity-like status and thus heavy competition between teahouses. New varieties of dim sum are being invented almost daily - influenced heavily by the tea pastry dishes of Shanghai, Beijing, and the West. However, as the situation in China continues to become unstable and war more frequent, more and more chefs are taking their culinary expertise to nearby Hong Kong. Nonetheless, the ancient practice of dim sum will undoubtedly continue to carry on, a true form of cultural pride and significance for the Cantonese people."
 lngkmt.21.a: "Let's eat!"

 lngkmt.22.t: "Remembering the Martyrs"
 lngkmt.22.d: "Guangdong... the cradle of the revolution. Ever since the collapse of the Ming Dynasty, dissent towards the Manchu rulers of the north has been ever so prevalent in the southernmost province of China. Guangdong is indeed the birthplace of the national revolution. The martyrs of the revolution were born in Guangdong such as the 72 martyrs who gave their lives in the Second Guangzhou Uprising to get rid of the Qing. Like a suicide squad, they wrote letters to their loved ones before they carried out their fateful activities. Indeed the spirit of martyrdom would be carried on in the Dare to Die Corps, patriots willing to give their lives for a freer China in the subsequent revolution of 1911 and the Northern Expedition. With the return of the Qing, the sacrifices of the martyrs were indeed put into question. Were their sacrifices in vain?\n\nNo more. With the return of a republican government in Guangzhou however, this has changed. Like the mythical phoenix, the movement towards a free China is born again! We have regrouped and are more invigorated to avenge our fallen brothers and to rid ourselves of the pollution that is the Qing Dynasty. We will avenge our brothers and undertake a new expedition to the north. The martyrs will be glorified and remembered in statues and prose from all over China. With our position secured, we will plan, we will practise, and we will be ready to depose the Qing despots once and for all."
 lngkmt.22.a: "Fan Qīng fù Míng!"

 lngkmt.23.t.annexed: "Fate of the Third NRA"
 lngkmt.23.t.long_yun: "The NRA flees Yunnan"
 lngkmt.23.d.annexed: "After the failed Northern Expedition, the remaining members of the 3rd NRA returned to Yunnan in order to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration and with the province now under our control, we have the opportunity to reintegrate the lost members of the KMT into the NRA. Generals Zhu Peide, He Yingqin and Kim Hong-il are loyal members of the KMT and will be given the opportunity to put their talents to good use within the NRA. Generals Fan Shisheng, Jin Handing and Luo Binghui are also candidates to be integrated into the NRA however their loyalty to the KMT is uncertain."
 lngkmt.23.d.long_yun: "After the failed Northern Expedition, the remaining members of the 3rd NRA returned to Yunnan in order to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration. However, after General Long Yun secured Yunnan following the bloody civil war, the generals of the Kuomintang decided to flee the province - fearing for their lives. Generals Zhu Peide, He Yingqin and Kim Hong-il are loyal members of the KMT and will be given the opportunity to put their talents to good use within the NRA. Generals Fan Shisheng, Jin Handing and Luo Binghui are also candidates to be integrated into the NRA however their loyalty to the KMT is uncertain."
 lngkmt.23.a: "Only the reliable generals can be trusted."
 lngkmt.23.b: "They will avenge their failures with us."

 lngkmt.30.t: "Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue Arrive in Guangzhou"
 lngkmt.30.d: "This morning, the former National Revolutionary Army generals Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue arrived in Guangzhou with their humble petition to receive commissions to serve in Liangguang's NRA.\n\nHaving spent the last years in exile following the collapse of the Northern Expedition, the two men fled to India, where they acted as advisors and mentors to an overseas Sino-Indian Military Mission. Upon their return to China following the League War, they pledged their services to the leftist-dominated Central Committee. It would appear, however, that they have chosen the wrong side. The left wing of the party, broken as always due to their constant factional infighting, has fled once more into exile with their most recent defeat during the League War.\nBoth men do not share leftist sentiments with Zhang, having once led the Fourth Army of the Kuomintang alongside generals such as Chen Jitang and Li Jishen. Do we trust our former comrades, or should we send them off into exile once more?"
 lngkmt.30.a: "Comrades, once more!"
 lngkmt.30.b: "You have tasted exile once, now taste it again."

 lngkmt.40.t: "The Question of the Constitution"
 lngkmt.40.d: "Years have passed since the Kuomintang's Guangzhou Military Government set out to unify China under the flag of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth. In those days, it was necessary - if not paramount for the country to be under the protective guidance of the Kuomintang party. The Chinese Kuomintang was to be the party for the people, but it had to guide them carefully to a state of democracy.\n\nWith the unification of the party, however, many of the liberal and leftist factions of the Kuomintang have begun to clamour for the opening up of the political forum and for Generalissimo Li Zongren to declare an end to martial law and political tutelage. Led by politicians such as Song Qingling and Sun Fo, the liberal coalition has demanded that Li help ratify the new \"Five Power Constitution\", which the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen originally proposed.\n\nNonetheless, right-wing radicals and conservative elements within the military have implored the Generalissimo to hold off on ratifying the constitution. There were still plenty of Zhili, Manchu, German, and syndicalist hideouts across the country, and the government must be led by the Generalissimo - as he alone would have the power to control China through his leadership."
 lngkmt.40.a: "Ratify it and promise elections in the coming year..."
 lngkmt.40.b: "The period of tutelage must continue!"

 lngkmt.50.t: "The Congress of [GetYear] is Held"
 lngkmt.50.d: "Today in [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader] announced the opening of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. In a gesture of goodwill, he has allowed the other political organisations and cliques of the Kuomintang to participate in the Kuomintang's demonstration of its democratic centralism. Absent from the National Congress would be the Chinese Syndicalist Party, which following the collapse of the previously left-wing dominated Central Committee, rejected the leadership of the Guangzhou Kuomintang as \"illegitimate reactionaries.\"\n\nRepresenting the far-left of the party would be the former Chairman of the party, Wang Jingwei, and his Reorganised Comrades Association. He is followed by the Provisional Action Committee, co-led by Chen Mingshu and Song Qingling - the former has graciously stepped down in favour of the popular widow of the late Dr. Sun.\n\nThe \"political centre\" of the Kuomintang is led by Sun Fo's Reconstruction clique and Lin Sen's Western Hills Clique. They are also joined by the moderate but business related \"Political Science Clique\" led by Zhang Qun. It is followed by the right wing of the party, primarily military leaders who are loyal first to the Generalissimo and then to the party second.\nUltimately, the Congress came to the compromise that the tutelage period will remain until China is recovered enough. Whether or not that will come true...remains to be seen for now."
 lngkmt.50.a: "The delegates take their seats..."

 lngkmt.51.t: "The National Anthem of the Republic of China"
 lngkmt.51.d: "A beautiful and artistic collaboration between the greatest minds of the Chinese Kuomintang from Liao Zhongkai, Shao Yuanchong, Dai Jitao, and the late Hu Hanmin, by a near-unanimous vote by the Kuomintang's new central committee - the new national anthem of the country was adopted to become the "The Three Principles of the People officially." The song's lyrics come from the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's opening preamble to the Whampoa Military Academy's first class and has enjoyed a newfound popularity since the country's unification. Some dissenting opinions within the Kuomintang's political sphere have argued that having a political party song to represent an entire nation is wrong and dictatorial - but the Central Committee has sponsored the National Anthem Editing and Research Committee to promote the party song across the country."
 lngkmt.51.a: "Wonderful!"

 lngkmt.52.t: "The Policy on the Minzu"
 lngkmt.52.d: "\"Article I: The territory of the Republic of China consists of the various Provinces and Mongolia and Tibet.\"\n\nAs one of the most controversial platforms of the Kuomintang, the Chinese Kuomintang believes that the regions of Mongolia and Tibet are firmly Chinese territories. Much of Sun Yat-sen's writings and indeed those that are cherished by the Kuomintang's right wing see China as a nation locked amongst other nations in a struggle of natural selection. The idea of \"Minzu\" revolves around a common livelihood, language, religion, customs, and most importantly, a shared bloodline. To China's non-Han Minzu, Sun would dismiss them as numerically insignificant. After all, the Han people resisted extermination and even assimilated their occupiers, the Yuan Mongols and the Qing Manchus. Nonetheless, Sun's writings on imperialism warned that China has been in a steady period of decline, and if China fell victim to imperialism, it would most certainly be exterminated.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Sun implied that China's past history of benevolent imperialism differs significantly from the imperialism practised by the West and Japan. Historically, China's expansion was based on the recognition of the Chinese cultural supremacy among her neighbours and the hierarchical world order of the tribute system. This type of consensual veneration, Sun argues, does not exist among those western subjects of imperialism."
 lngkmt.52.a: "We maintain the late Premier's policies."

 lngkmt.53.t: "Anti-Imperialism"
 lngkmt.53.d: "Another issue between the delegates at the conference was the nature of the Kuomintang's anti-imperialism. Harkening to the days of the \"revolutionary\" Kuomintang, the leftists of the congress have argued that the Kuomintang must take an active anti-colonial stance in freeing Asia from the chains of foreign imperialism and to fight against colonialism actively.\n\nNonetheless, Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader] finds a compelling argument in members of the Political Science Clique, bankers and industrialists who argue that in China's present state - forming economic ties and forging relationships with the West, for now, is the best way to lead the revolution in China. They argue that China's industrial base is so limited that it will most definitely require investments from the great industrialised nations of the world. This argument has been condemned by members of the left-wing, especially the RCA, who have denounced the regime as failing to meet the objectives of what they claim Dr. Sun's vision to be."
 lngkmt.53.a: "We will tread carefully among the West."

 lngkmt.54.t: "The NEC"
 lngkmt.54.d: "Created in accordance with the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the National Reconstruction Commission is to be led by a new central planning organisation, the National Economic Council (NEC).\n\nLed by the dynamic Harvard graduate Song Ziwen, the financial advisor Kong Xiangxi, and the left-wing socialist Chen Gongbo, the National Economic Council's primary goals are to develop the coastal industrial economy. The NEC's works are devoted to water conservancy, transportation, public health, and agriculture, with their most ambitious idea being the Cotton Control Commission or the CCC. Furthermore, the NEC also reflects the anti-imperialism movement by promoting the coastal Chinese economy as an alternative to the poor economic practices of the Guangxi Clique.\n\nThis eclectic combination of the industrialist Song Ziwen and the Marxist Chen Gongbo traces a shared lineage in both men's visions for a state-centred and nationalist-oriented reconstruction. Within these parameters, they advocate for economic and institutional reforms aimed at improving the country's economy, led by the direction of the state. It is only appropriate that they deem their practices \"national capitalism\" and envision China's coastal cities becoming new economic zones for the country's modernisation."
 lngkmt.54.a: "Can we realise National Capitalism?"

 lngkmt.55.t: "The Fate of Puyi"
 lngkmt.55.d: "Inevitably as the congress draws to a conclusion, there is the issue of what to do with the captured Puyi, captured in the final days of the wars of unification. The former \"Son of Heaven\" now lays meek and ashamed in a jail cell, and is fate is to be determined by the Central Committee.\n\nWhile members of the left and the liberals, such as Sun Fo, have advocated for Puyi to be pardoned and to encourage the former Qing Emperor to flee into exile - members of the right-wing, especially the Generalissimo, have backed Puyi to be shot. Puyi represents one of the greatest Hanjian to ever grace Chinese history, having worked with the Germans to crush the National Revolution and reinstalled the Qing Empire - reversing the sacrifices that the martyrs died for in the Xinhai Revolution. Ultimately, the fate of Puyi is determined to be that he is..."
 lngkmt.55.a: "Give the fatal order..."
 lngkmt.55.b: "Send him far away from China."

 lngkmt.56.t: "The Congress Concludes"
 lngkmt.56.d: "Finally after much discourse, the First National Congress of the Kuomintang has concluded. The Generalissimo has promised to revisit the idea of ending political tutelage after the era of reconstruction is complete. However, until then - China will remain a one-party state as all will know that only the glorious party of the Chinese Kuomintang can bring back honour and freedom for the Chinese people. Long live the Kuomintang, Long live the Republic of China!"
 lngkmt.56.a: "Wansui!"

 lngkmt.60.t: "Our Ties to the Shanghai Underground"
 lngkmt.60.d: "From the dying addict on the street to the high-class businessmen in Shanghai, none can deny opium pervades the fabric of Chinese society. According to some estimates, by 1923 - China was producing 30 million pounds of opium a year, compared to 2 million for India and 1.15 million in the rest of the Near East. For example - 90% of adult male addicts in Yunnan, with many babies born as addicts, have acquired their habits in the wombs of addicted mothers. Some idealistic dreamers look onto the Kuomintang’s National Revolution as a possibility that the vice will be stamped out, that with the end of Chinese warlordism will come the suppression of this scrooge of a plant.\n\nNonetheless, the Nationalists under the leadership of [PRC.GetLeader] are pragmatic in need for military finance. Since 1923, Sun Yat-sen had established a precedent by licensing brothels and opium dens for national revolution. Likewise, while [PRC.GetLeader] has declared that opium is to be suppressed; it is essentially a cover for the fact that the Party controls the opium supply.\n\nAs such, the Nationalists in Guangzhou have found an ally in organised crime outfits, such as the Green Gangs. These triads, while nominally “apolitical” nonetheless see the Nationalist government as the best force to stamp out radical leftists and the warlords. At the same time, they are also more than willing to play a part in the Nationalists’ monopoly of narcotics. With the development of our state, some of these “Shanghai men” have offered their services to [PRC.GetNameDef] - to aid in the greater national revolution."
 lngkmt.60.a: "The money must flow somehow..."

 lngkmt.61.t: "The Whampoa Class of [GetYear]"
 lngkmt.61.d: "“You will carry on the ideals of the revolutionary martyrs, laying down your lives and shedding your blood, making the foundation of the Chinese Republic secure, causing the Sanminchuyi to be manifested in a practical way; and then the revolution will be proclaimed loudly, like France’s.,.if the revolution is not finished, China shall die, and a race of 400,000,000 will become extinct. The death of our country and the extinction of our race are dependant on the life and death of you gentleman... Therefore, we definitely must open this school, and we must make a revolutionary army of men who will save the country and the people.”\n\nThese were the words of our beloved and esteemed eternal premier to the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Once more, the academy doors were reopened after years of inactivity, and a new commencement ceremony was dedicated to a new class of Whampoa, [PRC.GetLeader] spoke these words with fiery passion and intensity - mirroring the frustration of the Kuomintang organisation. With the collapse of the NRA during the Northern Expedition, the KMT had been associated with nothing but failure. With this new class of ideologically motivated soldiers willing to shed blood for their nation, perhaps there is a chance - that the flame of revolution has not yet been snuffed out."
 lngkmt.61.a: "We'll finish what they started."

 lngkmt.62.t: "Propaganda to the People"
 lngkmt.62.d: "Article 11: The activities of radio broadcasting stations should be limited to the following :\n1. Speeches of public interest.\n2. News and reports on the market situation and meteorology.\n3. Music, songs, and other entertainment programmes.\n4. Commercial advertisements but these should not exceed one-tenth of all broadcasting time.\n\nArticle 12: Radio broadcasting stations must not broadcast anything that violates Party principles, damages public order, and offends decency; violators will be prosecuted in the countries.\n\nWith these new party guidelines, the Ministry of Communications has been established today in [GXC.GetNameDef]. In radio broadcasting and newspaper media, the Ministry of Communications is working on a means to create a new medium for unifying the country and to “civilise” the masses - consistent with their efforts to unite the country linguistically and culturally under the KMT’s hegemony. To spread the ideals of the Three Principles of the People and to encourage the masses to partake in the Kuomintang’s revolution, the Party has formally commissioned a Party newspaper (The Minguo Ribao) and a Party broadcasting station (Zhongguo Zhongyang Wuxian Gunagbo Diantai - China Central Radio Broadcasting Station or CCBS)."
 lngkmt.62.a: "The people will hear and they will know."

 lngkmt.63.t: "Song Ziwen's Economic Principles"
 lngkmt.63.d: "In a brazen declaration, Song Tziwen declared today in a speech that the military phase of the revolution was over and that the government should turn to reconstruction. The Harvard-educated economist has strong ties as the brother of Song Qingling and had been recruited by Sun Yat-sen to finance the Guangdong Government.\n\nHe has created three points to reform and rebuild China's economy from the provincial Kuomintang government to a truly national Republic of China. The first was the establishment of a National Budget Commission to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance to set up a budget system. The Commission was tasked with both deciding and controlling government expenditures. Much to the annoyance of military leaders in the NRA and Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader], he has also called for the demobilisation of the military and cuts in military expenditures. Finally, he has called for a comprehensive currency reform - the replacement of the imperial tael with the yuan, a central bank, and a central mint.\n\nAs a civilian leader of the Kuomintang, Song’s proposal represents a new opposition movement against the Kuomintang’s military leadership. He has repeatedly emphasised the need to reduce military spending in favour of government development for the country, in his views, only a healthy national economy can produce a reliable tax base and provide the government with the funds for reconstruction."
 lngkmt.63.a: "Let's get to work."

 lngkmt.64.t: "Future of the National Revolution"
 lngkmt.64.d: "With the revolution secured on the Chinese mainland and the national unification at last, there are certainly questions as to the future direction of the Kuomintang. While domestic issues are being addressed as part of the National Reconstruction, there are also many who share in the idea that China’s place is not merely to be confined to the Middle Country, but rather to extend her influence across the Pacific.\n\nAfter all, are we not the sons of Yan and Huang, destined to rule and lead East Asia? Has it not been China for centuries that was the epitome of a cultural and political hegemon, practising not what some may denounce as imperialism but rather a sense of cultural hegemony due to the innate superiority of Chinese civilisation. Across Asia, there are plenty of peoples and nations that lie oppressed under the boot of imperialism. Under the revived Republic of China, will there be peace, sovereignty, and tranquillity across Asia - no more shall the people cry out in desperation; we will help them realise the Three Principles’ of the People."
 lngkmt.64.a: "We will maintain the peace of the world."

 lngkmt.65.t: "Goals of the New Life Movement"
 lngkmt.65.d: "Despite our success over the comprador enemies, the National Revolution still remains…unfinished. The Chinese people are, as a whole; lazy, selfish, undisciplined, and dissolute. From the opium addict to the prostitute, our society is in need of great reform.\n\nTo guide the people and to lead them to become true national citizens, we must re-introduce to our nation the four great values: Li (natural rites), Yi (the righteousness of justice), Lian (honesty or cleanliness), and Chi (the notion of right and wrong). These are Confucian values but surely it is impossible to have people know the 96 rules of people’s daily behavior. This is Confucianism for the masses, stripped to its bare ethical essentials - if we are to have a new life that accords with the four values, then we must talk less about avenging national humiliation and first about how to wash our faces in clean water.\n\nWhen society achieves a state of obedience, sacrifice, strictness, and cleanliness - then we will be able to come together and bravely sacrifice everything for the nation. What is, therefore the goal of this movement? Simply put, it is to thoroughly militarise the lives of the citizens of the entire nation so that they can cultivate courage and swiftness, endure suffering and hard work - most of all, they must be prepared to sacrifice everything for the nation."
 lngkmt.65.a: "And time will tell whether or not we were right..."

 lngkmt.66.t: "Lectures from the Political Department"
 lngkmt.66.d: "As the National Revolutionary Army grows in size and strength, the soldiers of the NRA are instructed to attend their lectures.

 lngkmt.66.a: "The way of the Party is always right!"
 lngkmt.66.b: "I want to attend a KMT lecture!"

 lngkmt.67.t: "The Lecture Begins"
 lngkmt.67.d: "Gathered together in a hurdle of soldiers from places as far apart as Hunan and Yunnan, the new cadets listened to their political commissar as the young officer bellowed out in fluent putonghua the political commands:\n\"Comrades, Recite the Ten Commandments of the Revolutionary Army!\"\n\nThe cadets of the National Revolutionary Army are consistently fed with revolutionary ideals of political indoctrination from their superiors and officers.

 lngkmt.68.a: "Through blood and sacrifice, we will unite China."

 lngkmt.69.t: "The Ministry of Education"
 lngkmt.69.d: "Inspired by his visit and observance of the French educational system, the Chinese educator Cai Yuanpai had plans to design an elaborate and modern education system for the masses of China in accordance with the Three Principles of the People. In a 1922 proposal, Cai recommended that the Chinese government establish university districts where chancellors of these universities would work together to form a Council of Higher Education - who could discuss concerns without fears of government interference. His goal was a unified, strong higher education, free from the influence of the government.\n\nDuring the Guangzhou Nationalist Government, the Party established a Central Educational Council to concern itself with educational matters. With the fatal collapse of the Kuomintang’s leftist faction, leftist intellectuals like Cai have nervously re-entered the political sphere with Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader] welcoming the educator to partake in a new Central Educational Council. Cai, nonetheless, has attempted to set up his own University Council.\n\nNonetheless, in a near-unanimous vote held in the Central Committee, the Nationalist Government officially voted to abolish the University of Council and replace it with a Ministry of Education as the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen intended. Furthermore, the Nationalist Government has also endorsed the Party’s propaganda department to partake in the education of society."
 lngkmt.69.a: "Interesting."

 lngkmt.70.t: "The Shining Republic"
 lngkmt.70.d: "Look at how our national flag is now flying in the sky; it is fluttering in the wind. It looks beautiful, it looks majestic - the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth. Our national flags are now flying across the world, and they are showing the strength of our country and our armed forces. And this national flag glorifies the Republic of China. We hope from this time onward, this flag can lead all our fellow men and women. To work hard to rebuild the country. We will endeavor to rebuild our agriculture, our industry and the economy. We will also revive our culture and art. And we hope we will stay in harmony with all other countries around the world."

He attended the Guangxi Military Cadre Training School under a ground-breaking modernised curriculum as part of wider reforms within the Chinese military. This cutting edge knowledge would serve him well when he made a name for himself serving in a Guangxi student militia, later climbing the ranks to become one of the most influential generals in the Warlord Era. A loyal supporter of Sun Yat-sen's vision for a democratic China, he was part of the triumvirate known as the New Guangxi Clique, which sought to overthrow Lu Rongting's regional warlord government. Unfortunately, the collapse of the Northern Expedition and the German intervention in China would lead to the New Guangxi Clique snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, fleeing in exile alongside many other Kuomintang members to Yunnan. Since then, he has worked to train a new generation of officers, passing down the book smarts he learned in Guangxi, and the bitter lessons the Northern Expedition has taught him.§!"

He was a member of the Tongmenghui at a young age despite understanding little about Sun Yat-sen's vision for China initially. Educated by Cai E, he quickly rose through the ranks under the Guangxi Clique and he would personally rise to prominence through Yunnan's invasion of Guangxi in 1923. Gathering a significant force as Yunnan retreated, he aligned himself with the KMT forces and established the New Guangxi Clique after evicting the Old Clique from the province.\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Li’s skilled leadership of the Nationalist Seventh Army earned it the moniker of \"Army of Steel\", being one of the few NRA commanders to have defeated Wu Peifu on the field. However, the Expedition failed, and Li was forced to retreat to Guangxi, where he would be dislodged by a combined Old Guangxi-Guangdong force aligned with the Zhili Clique. The New Guangxi Clique then fled to Yunnan, protected by Tang Jiyao in order to safeguard his province's autonomy.\nAfter his defeat, Li Zongren focused on rebuilding his forces and consolidating, rapidly becoming the informal leader of the KMT's right-wing. From there, he plotted to invade Guangxi when the opportunity would present itself and re-establish a Nationalist presence in Southern China. That is, one not tainted by Wang Jingwei's French-dependent Central Committee and would truly reunite China first instead of \"playing revolutionary\" from a comfortable exile.§!"

In the June 16 Incident of 1922, Chen Ce sided with Sun Yat-sen, his marines instrumental in resisting Chen Jiongming's attack while his ships saved Sun and forced the rebels out of Guangzhou. Chen Ce would become commander of the Guangdong Fleet as a result. During the Northern Expedition, he bravely led the defence of the old fortress of Humen Island, which guarded the sea entrance to Guangzhou, against the German Expedition. This would cost him his left leg, but his personal bravery ensured he wouldn't be purged during Chen Jiongming's return. Ever since then, Chen Ce has fought to maintain the Guangdong Fleet's independence from the Army despite its insignificant size. His actions during the July Incident and the German Intervention cemented his reputation as a skilled and brave naval and marine commander.§!"

As the younger adopted son of Lu, his views and attitudes were heavily influenced by his adoptive father. He valued maintaining the Clique's image as a pluralist military entity that was fixated on maintaining Guangxi's independence.\nWhen Lu Rongting became governor of Guangxi during the Xinhai Revolution, Ma was his deputy, and the two would be involved in the National Protection Movement than overthrew Yuan Shikai's regime.\nAfter a brief war with Yunnan, Lu's Guangxi Clique was evicted from the province by the KMT-aligned New Guangxi Clique. While Lu retreated to Hong Kong and allied with Chen Jiongming, Ma Ji, who was in Hunan at the time, went north and joined forces with Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique. By the time of the KMT's failed Northern Expedition, he was leading the Fifteenth Army against the KMT. He scored a victory against the retreating Nationalists' Seventh Army, which was also composed of soldiers from Guangxi. He would later convince them to stand down, declaring that \"Guangxi people do not fight Guangxi people\".\nSince the Northern Expedition, Ma Ji rejoined Lu Rongting after his restoration to the Guangxi provincial government. From there, he led the provincial army's modernisation plan, giving him ample influence and experience in managing the Clique's affair.

He would be an officer during the Anti-Monarchy War, Constitutional Protection War, and Guangdong-Guangxi War under Chen Jiongming. During the June 16 incident, he would side with Sun Yat-sen, participating in a mutiny orchestrated by Li Jishen. Despite considering himself a \"staunch follower of Sun Yat-sen\", Chen was critical of the presence of Russian and French advisors, and Sun's pro-Internationale foreign policy, putting him firmly in Hu Hanmin's right-wing of the Kuomintang. He would stay in Guangdong during the Northern Expedition, fighting off the remnants of Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Army before making a desperate attempt to stop the German Expedition as part of the Fourth \"Iron\" Army. Hu Hanmin's purge by Chiang Kai-shek put Chen in an awkward position within the party, and when the Northern Expedition failed, he disavowed Wang Jingwei's leadership of the KMT and followed Chen Mingshu back to Guangzhou, now back in Chen Jiongming's control.\nDespite having opposed Chen Jiongming, Chen Jitang soon came into conflict with Chen Mingshu because of his progressive platform and alignment with the KMT's left-wing. Instead, he was won over by his former enemy's economic policy and sensible leadership, which saw increasing prosperity for his beloved Guangdong. With amends made with his former enemy, Chen Jitang was heavily involved in rebuilding the Guangzhou Military Academy with Whampoa destroyed, firmly committed to improving education in both the Army and the province.§!"

As a British national, he worked as a comprador for HSBC, managing his own silk farm as well. After successfully speculating during and after the Shanghai Financial Crisis of 1910, he became one of the most influential businessmen in the South.\nThe Xinhai Revolution and the chaotic first years led to poor social and financial security, prompting the formation of the Guangzhou Merchants' Public Safety Organization, or Merchant Corps, which Chen led. The Merchant Corps ensured stability in the city during the Republican era and later faced increasing expropriation and mismanagement by the KMT rebels.\nIn 1924, Chen Lianbo's Merchant Corps rose up against the KMT in an attempt to overthrow them but failed. The remnants fled to Hong Kong, where they allied with Chen Jiongming's Federalists to preserve Guangdong's stability and autonomy.\nAfter the failure of the Northern Expedition, the Merchant Corps worked with the Germans in Guangzhou and betrayed Chen Jiongming, ensuring a Chinese presence and protection from both German encroachment and the increasingly radical reforms in Guangdong. Chen Lianbo himself maintains a great public image by donating a significant portion of his wealth to charity, especially to hospitals and schools.
