### Events ###
laos.2.desc:0 "After the securing of our independence there has been growth in syndicalist and Hmong resistance fighting, with the Pathet Lao gaining ground and getting more consecutive victories against our armed forces. Today is a parade to celebrate the return of the royal family. King Sisavang Vong and his heir apparent Sisavang Vatthana stand on the side of the parade route watching the lao Issara forces march past them for the ceremony. As the last of the soldiers move past the two, 3 of the soldiers turn around and shoot Vong and Vatthana. Both are rattled with bullets. The soldiers are quickly killed as soon as they fired their weapons, but it was too late, the shots had been fired and Vong and Vatthana were dead. Now the privy council is placed in control of the country, with a final decision on the Laotian leadership future in a few days."
laos.3.desc:0 "As the kingdom still mourns for the loss of their King and Prince, the Privy Council makes a decision on the next ruler of Laos. The first faction is the Rightists headed by Boun Oum who is a prince of another Laotian dynasty. His goals are to make Laos greater again, with himself being heavily nationalistic, as well as allowing further empowerment by the military. Next is the Neutralists led by Souvanna Phouma who is a more moderate force to Boun Oum. But he seeks to make Laos a geopolitically neutral nation and allow for the existence of a constitutional monarchy. The final faction is the Lao Issara faction. This faction was formed by Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa and was the main faction of the Laotian army that was resisting French and German colonialism. unlike his counterparts, he seeks to reach a deal with the Pathet Lao and form a united government with them in the face of outside imperialism. As days pass, the Privy council makes their final decision."
laos.1.desc:0 "At last we are free! The syndicalist tyranny shal no longer oppress us! We shall fight for a new era of prosperity for the Lao people. But not all is sunshine and rainbows. We still face syndicalist resistance and now resistance from Hmong rebels. With also economic damages caused by the Indochina civil war, with much of our infrastructure being demolished. We yet again thank the allies who have liberated our forces, but now we are on the road to recovery."
laos.4.desc:0 "The Pathet Lao are on the move, their forces aiming straight for our capital. They attack our positions at night, though exhausted, they attack the next day. Now they are on the run, we have pushed them back. But is this a trap? Some word has spread saying that their retreat is a trap for us to be encircled and destroyed. Command has to decide our next action. That action is…"
laos.5.desc:0 "As the results of the Luang Namtha still elude us, we have noticed that Pathet Lao lines seem weak near Lak Sao. Our command has ordered us to attack the position, as best as possible. With at least wanting us to further weaken forces if we do not manage to push. We push and manage to initially push through their positions, but we discover that this would be an ambush, we found this out the hard way. We await command to see what to do next."
laos.6.desc:0 "The final battle as it seems.The battle for the capital. Pathet Lao and Hmong forces now attack the outskirts of the city. They push hard, but we defend harder. Now we have an opportunity to take one last blow. Do we take it?Or do we not take it, either option can spill victory or defeat"
laos.7.desc:0 "Now as the dust settles, we view the outcome of the conflict. The outcome is…"
laos.8.desc:0 "Hurrah! We march through the capital, as cries of joy and jubilation reach the streets of Vientiane. Now we decide who shall lead us to a new era of prosperity. The Hmong rebels are a group of radical socialists who seek to unite Hmong peoples and allow for full racial equality , under their idea of a state. With also aspirations of a form of non-marxist socialism. The other victors are the Pathet Lao, a leftwing group organized by Souphanouvong, who was a major supporter of the Indochinese syndicalists. The group seeks to implement socialism in Laos , with the two factions wanting similar socialist practices."
laos.9.desc:0 "As we secured Laos for socialism, we now decide who shall lead the interim government. This government shall decide who will lead the reconstruction period. First faction is the communist faction, led by Souphanouvong. This faction seeks to implement Ho Chi Minh thought, and also a collectivist economy. The other faction is the syndicalists led by Kaysone, who seeks to have a Bukharinist style of syndicalism, with a socialist market economy, and supporting the expansion of growth of trade unions."
laos.10.desc:0 "We have finished our reconstruction period. Now we have formed a true revolutionary vanguard party to lead us on for our socialist future. First faction is the communist faction, led by Souphanouvong. This faction seeks to implement Ho Chi Minh thought, and also a collectivist economy. The other faction is the syndicalists led by Kaysone, who seeks to have a Bukharinist style of syndicalism, with a socialist market economy, and supporting the expansion of growth of trade unions."
laos.11.desc:0  "Now a new debate has surfaced in the LPRP, brought up by some of Souphanouvong's closest allies. The debate is on whether to restore the monarchist and make it socialist, or to keep the republican status for the socialist state."
laos.12.desc:0  "After our great victory against the leftist terrorists, we now prepare to finish their tiny forces. But for some reason, members of our government want to offer peace and allow for peaceful integration. Now we have to decide on peaceful integration or to mercilessly crush these terrorists to the last man."
laos.13.desc:0  "In a lasting revolt against German oppression, Paj Cai Vwj was leading major fights against the Germans for their colonial policies that unfairly targeted the Hmong people. In one such banner, Vwj’s force were on the retreat. In order to avoid complete annihilation, Vwj’s sister, stood behind to help defend the retreating forces. She then raised a flag made of hemp, as her final actions.Legend says, ‘. She carried a white flag made of hemp, which she used to deflect bullets. She is said to have been a righteous virgin, which is why the Heavens allowed her to have such miraculous powers. She led the army into many successful battles.’. Now the hemp flag shall be a symbol of our revolutionary struggle and an honor to our fallen comrades."
laos.14.desc:0  "We shall save our hmong brothers and show them our dream of uniting all Hmong peoples. May we reach lands from Burma to Vietnam, and from Yunnan to Malay!"
