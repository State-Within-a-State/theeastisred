### Events ###
laos.2.desc:0 "After the securing of our independence there has been growth in syndicalist and Hmong resistance fighting, with the Pathet Lao gaining ground and getting more consecutive victories against our armed forces. Today is a parade to celebrate the return of the royal family. King Sisavang Vong and his heir apparent Sisavang Vatthana stand on the side of the parade route watching the lao Issara forces march past them for the ceremony. As the last of the soldiers move past the two, 3 of the soldiers turn around and shoot Vong and Vatthana. Both are rattled with bullets. The soldiers are quickly killed as soon as they fired their weapons, but it was too late, the shots had been fired and Vong and Vatthana were dead. Now the privy council is placed in control of the country, with a final decision on the Laotian leadership future in a few days."
laos.3.desc:0 "As the kingdom still mourns for the loss of their King and Prince, the Privy Council makes a decision on the next ruler of Laos. The first faction is the Rightists headed by Boun Oum who is a prince of another Laotian dynasty. His goals are to make Laos greater again, with himself being heavily nationalistic, as well as allowing further empowerment by the military. Next is the Neutralists led by Souvanna Phouma who is a more moderate force to Boun Oum. But he seeks to make Laos a geopolitically neutral nation and allow for the existence of a constitutional monarchy. The final faction is the Lao Issara faction. This faction was formed by Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa and was the main faction of the Laotian army that was resisting French and German colonialism. unlike his counterparts, he seeks to reach a deal with the Pathet Lao and form a united government with them in the face of outside imperialism. As days pass, the Privy council makes their final decision."
