### Events ###
taiwan_info.1.desc:0 "Our story begins with the Qing dynasty's conquest of Taiwan. In 1683 the Qing annex Taiwan and make it apart of Fujian prefecture. The Qing would face rebellion from the natives much like those who controlled Taiwan before them. After the opium wars and losses to outside imperial powers the Qing's hold on Taiwan falters. Looking on this weakness, Japan goes to war with China for greater influence over Korea in 1895. For the Qing this would be a loss for them in 1896. This ends China's era in Taiwan and ushers in the Japanese era over Taiwan. \n\n§FJapanese Rule:§! \n\n After the loss to Japan, remaining Qing officials briefly proclaim the Republic of Formosa as to resist Japanese rule. Tho this would be pacified along with the dying indigenous rebels who by 1914 are mainly in the mountains. For the Great Weltkrieg Taiwanese nationals would be conscripted to fight in Asia against the Central Powers along with other Japanese colonial troops. By the end of the war, Japan had accepted a mild loss. This itself would inspire an increase in Taiwan independence violence. As a result new laws are introduced as early as 1915(before the war's end) to allow for some expression of Taiwanese cultures. But on the other hand would encourage further Japanese immigration to the island. Trying to allow a greater growth of the Japanese population on the island. \n\n After the Great Weltkrieg, the growing concern over further population discontent, as a result the Japanese government allows Taiwanese political parties to form and participate in the colonial diet. This move would also be used as a way to further integrate Taiwan into Japan. As the 20's role on, new Taiwan poltical organizations are formed, with the Home Rule Association, tho also some exiled and banned parties like the Taiwanese Communist Party and Taiwanese People's Party and KMT. These groups would initiate both violent and non violent resistance on the island. \n\n By 1936 the island faces an ever growing resistance but also greater efforts to integrate the island as the Navy and Army seek to control off the civilian government as to further their own interests. Taiwan becomes a ticking time bomb."

We have received word our a global financial crisis called 'Black Monday', as the news reached us, the stock exchange in Taipei went into a frenzy in which the economy has gone into a sudden sharp decline. Chaos has erupted in Taiwan, with anti colonial resistance now seeing fruther growth. Governor General Kiyoshi now feels with pressure mounting."
taiwan.2.desc:0 "After the shock and chaos of 'Black Monday', governor Kiyoshi has submit has resignation to the Emperor and has left his post. Now we remain leaderless in this time, in which Taiwan further slips into anarchy. Citizens of the Empire now wonder, who will govern the colony through this tough time for them."
taiwan.3.desc:0 "Alas, the Japanese Imperial Diet have delivered there decision on the appointment of Taiwan's new governor general. From this there are 4 candidates. The first being the army in which is the more nationalist of the 4, it seeks to promote continuation of and pushing forward Japanization. Next are the two mainly political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, who seeks relative status quo. Finally is a the home rule party, which seeks to grant better autonomy for Taiwan."
taiwan.4.desc:0 "Since the 1926, Taiwan's more or less liberal governors have allowed for the legalization of Taiwanese and Chinese Literary Societies. Such societies include Taiwan Minbao, written and run by Lai He, a highly respected Taiwanese literary writer, often called Taiwan's Lu Xun. Not to mention artists like Tang Tingpho, new Taiwanese art has become more viewed on the streets of Taipei. Though as there has been a rise in nationalist Taiwanese art, a growing concern amongst the Japanese colonial elite have flagged concerns that it maybe a sign of rebellion against them. Now the question has arisen to the Governor General.  Will there be a crackdown or a continuence?"

taiwan.5.desc:0 "After the losses of Black Monday, a group of Taiwanese aboriginals, better known as the 'Wushe rebellion' have made an attempt on a large offensive against our Taiwan garrison. Their offensive has failed and we have got them on the run. Now we have a chance to finally crush this rebellion. But also if we go ahead wouldn't this ruin our relationship with the Taiwanese locals? Should we just stop now, as they are too small to do anything? The governor makes his decisions."

TWI_japanese_lapdogs:0 "Japanese Lapdogs"
TWI_japanese_lapdogs_desc:0 "After our takeover of Taiwan from the corpse of the Qing Empire, we started grooming the island to our liking through influence of our great Japanese culture. This itself would be scaled back in 1915 as to curb the ever growing resistance. Tho after Japan's loss in the Weltkrieg, there has been a steady incline in freedom for Taiwan but also resistance against Japan. As greater political reforms were established, political parties were formed in which would partially advocate for the continuation of Japanese rule. Unsurprisingly these advocates would be placed into power, in which they would be called Japanese lapdogs by the island resistance."
TWI_violent_resistance:0 "Violent Resistance"
TWI_violent_resistance_desc:0 "After Japan's conquest of Taiwan, new resistance movements pop up left and right. The resistance itself is divided between pro Chinese and pro native stances. In the mountains are the natives, who use guerilla warfare in the heights to pounce on local supplies and Japanese patrols. But on the ground are the pro Chinese rebels who use the cities and low level jungles, executing police and assassinating government and army officials. As the resistance grows their becomes grand concern on how Japan can maintain Japanese rule."

TWI_non_violent_resistance_desc:0 "After Japan's conquest of Taiwan, new resistance movements pop up left and right. The resistance itself is divided between pro Chinese and pro native stances. Tho the non violent resistance that has formed is more pro Chinese rather than pro native. The forms of non violence include some politicians  passing laws that remove Japanese military influence, with also peaceful protests and strikes and small acts of decent like the boycott of Japanese goods. Tho the Japanese army stationed there would crackdown on these forms of non violence protests fearing they would become violent protest."

TWI_rsupress_three_vices_desc:0 "The 'Three Vices' considered by the Office of the Governor-General to be archaic and unhealthy were the use of opium, foot binding, and the wearing of queues. \n\n Much like mainland China in the late nineteenth century, opium addiction was a serious social problem in Taiwan, with some statistics suggesting that over half of the ethnic Chinese population of Taiwan were users of the drug. The intentional disfigurement of female feet through binding was common to mainland Chinese and Taiwanese society at the time, and the queue hairstyle worn by the male population was forced upon Han Chinese by the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty. \n\n Ever since the Japanese occupation, Japanese rule has been trying to outlaw and ban these practices as to make Taiwan a 'Model Colony'."
