CHI_NBIS_power_0:0 "A Couple of Radicals"
CHI_NBIS_power_0_desc:0 "A small and secretive group formed by mostly young, radical NRA officers heavily influenced by the various currents of totalist thought in Europe. They are believed to enjoy close ties with the ZhongTeJu. Their ideology consists of a host of influences from far-right Savinkovism to Maximist British economic planning, but the Sorelian necessity of violence most inspires them. These radicals see the complex bureaucratic nature of the Kuomintang to be the party’s downfall and wishes to see the party purged of its democratic elements - with the end goal of a party led by a glorious dictator (the lingxu). Their man ideologues include He Zhonghan being a procurer of an ideology called Neo-Tridemism, with Hu Zongnan focusing on a Savinkovist/Sorelian approach and finally the most mysterious figure, Dai Li who seeks a leftwing militarist state but a lot about him is unknown."

CHI_power_struggle_decision_category_desc:0 "After the split of the Kuomintang, the left Kuomintang embraces its revolutionary goals with the Chinese Syndicalist Party. In their united front they work with local leftwing forces to unite China under their image. but as the revolution occurs the Left KMT fears a split as the revolution wages on.\n\nThe §RMinsheng§! Faction is lead by the Gang of Four, which includes leaders such as Wang Jingwei, Zhou Enlai, Chiang Ching Kuo and Chen Gongbo. the Minsheng faction is quite aligned with the idea of a firmly socialist based economy, whilst playing on the livelihood point of Dr. Sun's 3 points of the People, as a justification for a completely socialist economy. Wang Jingwei seeks this path, but denies that syndicalism is a major part of his faction, with his faction leaning on the support of CSP militias who stayed with the united front after the CSP split between Liu Shaoqi and Chen Duxiu. Chiang Ching Kuo (CCK), seeks a form of tridemism adopted to the ideas of Leon Trotsky, by spreading the tridemist revolution across the global, with intent of funding such revolution.  As the son of Chiang Kai Shek (CKS), he is able to gain some sway over some of the rightwing Kuomintang warlords. Another major figure is Zhou Enlai, a former member of the Chinese Bolshevik Party (CBP, led  by Li Dazhao), joined the L-KMT military and is a string proponent of using the Marxist doctrine for tridemism , in which would be linked to the ideological concerns of the former mentor Li Dazhao.  Finally you have Chen Gongbo. Chen is technically called by his party colleagues as part of the 'syndie couple', in relation to his close relationship with Zhou Fohai. Both of which joined the CBP and later the CSP, they seek to translated Dr. Sun's words into means of syndicalism, with each being joint CSP & KMT members.\n\nThe §NMinquan§! Faction, is a faction that is broadly socialist and have a heavy handed approach to the Three Principles of the People. This faction is more ales suspicious of the Minsheng's close alignment with the CSP and former CBP members. The Minquan rose up in the more recent development of the L-KMT-CSP's guerilla conflict against Zhili forces. They seek to form a revolutionary vanguard, to guide the peasants and workers in a revolution against feudalism with the help of the resulting local-self-governments (LSG) formed and install a socialist society through an idea of National Capitalism. The Minquan faction has one peculiar fact of note; that the two faction heads are Dr. Sun's wife (Soong Ching-ling) and Dr. Sun's son (Sun Fo), each seeing some slightly different ideas on the implementation of issues such as landreform and socialism. \n\n§RMinsheng Faction: [?kmt_minsheng]§!\n§NMinquan Faction: [?kmt_minquan]§!\n"

CHI_united_front_decision_category:0 "The United Front"
CHI_united_front_decision_category_desc:0 "The §tUnited§! §BFront§! is an organization formed by the unofficial unification of the §BKuomintang§! and §tChinese Syndicalist Party§!. The story of this begins with the Chinese Bolshevik Party deciding to form a united front with the KMT under the guidelines of §YDr Sun Yat-Sen§!,  §YLi Dazhao§! and §YChen Duxiu§!. After the failure of the October Revolution and the subsequent split between Chen and Li, KMT was forced to pick a side in the split. Seeing the success of syndicalism in France, the KMT leaves §YLi Daozhao§! and the CBP in the dust, in favour of the more strategically allied Chinese Syndicalist Party. As the two parties fight side by side against their reactionary warlord foes, the KMT increasingly split on the issue of the United Front.  This would become one major issue leading to the formal split in the KMT after Dr Sun's death. But also this would ride along the subsequent split in the CSP between §YChen Duxiu§! and §YLiu Shaoqi§!, as Chen wanted to expand KMT cooperation, whilst Liu wants an independent revolution. As 1936 starts there is a friction in the Leftist KMT about the alliance with the CSP. With the §NMinquan§! citing that the alliance with the CSP should be temporary, whilst the §RMinsheng§! propose greater cooperation and a long standing coalition with the CSP. This battle deals also with the unionism that the KMT & CSP look over and contend with."

### Events


chinasyndie.0.desc:0 "As the turn of the May 4th riots occur, many students in Paris turn to syndicalism as per the rise of syndicalism in the country. The Chinese Syndicalist Party would be birthed in 1921, after the Chinese Bolshevik Party would fall due to the failure of the Bolsheviks in Russia, resulting in a large of amount of the movement world wide turning to syndicalism. The CBP was founded by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in 1919, just after the May 4th protests. In 1920, rolled around a debate within the party grew between Chen Duxui and Li Dazhao. Li sided with maintaining Bolshevism, whilst Chen looked at changing the party to syndicalism. By 1921 this intensified with disagreement over the united front with the KMT. With the CSP forming and splitting from the CBP in 1921 and joining the united front with the KMT, with the CBP collapsing on itself.\n\nAfter being pushed to defeat the KMT and CSP banded together to start guerilla warfare operations within Southern China, whilst remaining in exile in France. By 1930, the CSP started developing on the lines of factionalism in which two lines had emerged. The United Front line, and the Revolution line. The United Front line was led by the party's secretary, Chen Duxui, who supported the continuation of the United Front, with also adherence to a form of syndicalism based off the ideas of a Menshevik-Bolsehvik member named Leon Trotsky, whilst the Revolution line, lead by Liu Shaoqi denounced KMT cooperation, citing the KMT failures along with the CSP's on in the united front. In which meaning that the CSP should go independent of KMT allegiance and start an independent revolution. By 1936, the CSP under Chen would still be in exile with the KMT, whilst a Shaoqi's faction formed a lose alliance with KMT guerilla's as they stayed in China's vast lands."
chinasyndie.1.desc:0 "As mentioned before the CSP stands split between two lines. Unofficially both sides are essentially different parties, but both are still a united party on paper. The first faction that will be looked at is the 'United Front' Faction, led by Chen Duxui, who split from Dazhao and formed the CSP. Chen Duxiu was born on 8 October 1879 in the city of Anqing, in the Anhui province of the Qing Empire. He was the youngest of four children born to a wealthy family of officials. In his youth, he was described as volatile, emotional, intuitive, non-intellectual, and a defender of the underdog.hen was an exceptional student, but his poor experiences taking the Confucian civil service exams resulted in a lifelong tendency to advocate unconventional beliefs and to criticize traditional ideas.Chen took and passed the county-level imperial examination in 1896, and succeeded in the provincial-level examination the following year.He moved to Nanjing in 1902, after he was reported to have given speeches attacking the Qing government, and then to Imperial Japan the same year under a scholarship from the government to study at the Tokyo Shimbu Gakko, a military preparatory academy. It was in Japan where Chen became influenced by socialism and the growing Chinese dissident movement. In the summer of 1915, Chen founded the journal Youth – renamed to New Youth (La Jeunesse) in 1916 – in Shanghai. He would join Li Dazhao in study groups in Beijing and would help form the CBP(Chinese Bolshevik Party), though would split from the party citing his concerns of the failure of the October Revolution, and the rise of syndicalism. In 1921, He would formly split from Dazhao and would create the CSP. As soon a possible he would form the united front with the KMT and later the L-KMT, in which he served as part of their government."
chinasyndie.2.desc:0 "Though as the CSP, is exiled with the KMT in France, a worry grows from those still in China, as many of the CSP in the homeland see the KMT as controlling of their leaders in Paris. As a result, generals of the guerilla operations in China secretly head out to Paris(In 1929) to discuss with the CSP leadership Paris about the current situation. The leader of the general is Liu Shaoqi. He joined the newly formed CSP in 1921. The next year he would be the secretary of the All-China Labor Syndicate, led several railway workers' strikes in the Yangzi Valley and at Anyuan on the Jiangxi-Hunan border. Which he would use for his main guerilla operations for the CSP, gaining him prominence and status with in the party. In the meeting Duxiu and Shaoqi argued with, a split showing clearer than glass. Shaoqi goes back to China and declares that the true CSP are his forces and declared an end to the united front, opting to purge KMT officials and place in new revolutionaries who followed his cause. Some of his fighter did though declare support for Duxiu and joined the KMT militias. As by 1936 both sides would fight their warlord enemies and each other, with both holding strong. With Chen being with the KMT in Paris, and Liu being in his headquarters in Hunan, loosely in alliance with smaller leftwing groups in Hunan, Like Mao and He Long."
