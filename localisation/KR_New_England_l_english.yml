The Totalist faction of the SPA is notable for having heavier utopian 'Communist' and Bolshevik influence than other Totalists and often reject National Totalism.

NEE_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "American Friends Service Committee - §LOriginally disregarded and laughed at by established politicians, Clarence Pickett’s Quaker Alliance has managed to gain a concerning amount of sway within New England. Pickett has brought the Religious Society of Friends (AKA ‘Quakers’) to the forefront of New English politics by offering unconditional support to immigrants and refugees alike, while working to change the church from a religious institution into an outspoken political party dedicated to international neutrality, pacifism, and Christian charity. Citing the progressive precedent set by the Roosevelt-administration and the teachings of Jesus Christ, Pickett has begun drafting a set of crucial amendments for New England’s Constitution. Deemed the “Appeal to Heaven,” the Quaker platform aims to transform New England into a welfare state that can open its arms to the downtrodden across the shattered American continent.§!"
NEE_social_democrat_party:0 "Prohibition Party"
NEE_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Prohibition Party - §LAs America spiralled into war, many turned to Alcohol to escape their troubles. The War, the destruction and all the world can be forgotten about by simply taking a sip of various fermented plants. That is the plan. However, in reality people abuse the Devil’s nectar, and use it to commit horrible acts in their drunken rage. As well the productivity of all people decrease as the worker partakes in suds instead of doing their job. So, as Drunkenness ravages New England and the rest of the United States an unexpected force has risen from the dead. Due to the nationwide failure of prohibition, most sane people assumed that the Prohibition Party was dead in the ground; however, is has made a stunning comeback as New England is ravaged by drunkenness. The party now mainly bases itself in New England and is lead by David Leigh Colvin. Colvin believes that all New Englanders must be moral, compassionate, and caring for every man. The party’s main platform is to illegalize the sale and production of Alcohol, as well as prohibiting Pornography, instilling Christian Values into the nation, and helping the American Refugees fleeing from the Civil War. The party’s sudden re-birth has surprised many within New England, but can the party truly return from the dead?§!"
NEE_social_liberal_party:0 "Liberal Republican Party"
NEE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Liberal Republican Party - §LWhen the Intervention occurred, the Republican Party in New England was nearly destroyed. Now, as party officials attempt to put the pieces back together, there are increasing tensions over the party platform. Those more socially liberal-minded members of the party have split from the main party and are now calling themselves the Republican Party, though others have come to term them the "Liberal Republican Party". William Averall Harriman is the party standardbearer for the time being, but others have emerged in hopes of challenging him in the long term. Herbert H. Lehman, John Gilbert Winant, and powerful politician Thomas Dewey all hope to gain a spot at the head of the party, but time will tell to see which of these men will earn it. In the meantime, the party's espousal of education, a program of Social Security, and anti-corruption has made them popular with New Englanders, but with a split party, they may encounter difficulties in winning an election outright.§!"
NEE_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
NEE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - §LThe battered Republican Party has started to re-form, but it is not the same party that existed before. Now, more laissez-faire minded liberals in the party argue with those who are more in favor of government intervention and social policy. The divide has caused a split in the party, and now the laissez-faire wing, represented first and foremost by Percival P. Baxter, finds itself alone. Baxter leads the party for now, but in the upcoming elections, he will face challenges from Hamilton Fish III, Joseph William Martin Jr., and Christian Herter, all fairly unknown politicians. Any of the three could rise in prominence in coming years however, and the path the party takes may depend on who leads it, and what happens to the other faction of the Republican Party. For now, the Republicans must face a united Democratic Party in the coming races, and will struggle to maintain power in many parts of New England.§!"
NEE_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
NEE_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - §LThe Democratic Party of New England is both renowned and infamous for it's extreme reliance on political machines (even by the standards of the rest of the nation), mainly the ones in Massachusetts and urban regions. With a strong working class, Catholic and immigrant voter base they semi-openly promote using the patronage system for the public good and often argue it allows a way for the common man to have more direct ties with political leaders through their local machines. Recently they have taken the most moderate stance towards foreign policy with regards to other parties, seemingly wanting to unite America if the opportunity arises but otherwise wanting to stay out of the war, and only maintaining relations with the Entente if it's useful. However given their non-ideological nature all are aware this could change in the future.§!"

NEE_national_populist_party:0 "Providence Society"
NEE_national_populist_party_long:0 "Providence Society - §LDuring the Weltkrieg, untold thousands rushed to the relative safety, stability, and opportunity of America. As the war languished on, immigrants flooded New England, quickly and unexpectedly changing the face of the northeast. With these diverse, new interests came new problems: particularly, nativist resentment. These problems were only compounded by the economic recession that set in after the Kaiserreich began to isolate the United States of America. This discontent was championed by one of New England’s most famous personalities: the celebrity author, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s meteoric rise to fame in recent years is based on his tales of weird and diabolical fiction, seen by both fans and critics as giving voice to the xenophobia, economic insecurity, and reactionary instincts of New Englanders. Initially the darling of Boston Brahmins and New England’s Anglo-Saxon majority, Lovecraft’s work spread like wildfire across the country, turning him into an overnight sensation. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, one of Lovecraft's most famous novellas, deals obliquely with the threats of state conspiracy and invasion, as well as miscegenation and its monstrous consequences. Some of his most ardent followers swear that prophetic, astrological portents can be understood through comprehensive study of his work. To many, Lovecraft may just be another insane writer with less than moderate views, to others he is a prophet that can guide New England to safety. But whatever Lovecraft may be, he is still a shy, reclusive writer, unlikely to take any drastic action. The only ones in New England that wish to see him in power are the extreme Anglophiles. They view Lovecraft as a tool to ensure complete loyalty to Canada. For now, Lovecraft and his small circle of writers stick to Providence and continue on with their lives, only accompanied by small groups of fans and loyalists.§! "

Often openly skeptical of democracy, the Remnant is nonetheless opposed to state intervention in individual lives except to protect base rights through the justice system. Supported by extremely prominent intellectuals such as H.L. Mencken, the Remnant's middle and upper class supporters have grown in reaction to the perceived failures of the government and their role in destabilizing America, opposing Canadian influence in New England and as a reaction against the growth of populism and socialism, with them having a small volunteer militia to protect their rights from its perceived various enemies. Nonetheless, the Remnant itself is still deeply divided on whether democracy should play in the Republic or if voters supporting interventionism and control is simply too dangerous to liberty.§!"

Lead largely by American 'aristocrats' of Anglo-Saxon descent such as the Vanderbilt and Astor families, the 'The Committee to Defend America and the Crown' gradually merged with pro-Canadian business interests in the region until it became the leading pro-Entente group in the nation. Eventually as New England became besieged by syndicalism and the Radical Coalition, heavier political influence was needed and the alliance took the name of the old Federalist Party, a far older New England based party that was likewise pro-British. Viewing Canada as their best hope of beating back syndicalism and enriching New England, the Federalist Party half-expects to be appointed as the leaders of New England by Canada as a reward for their loyalism.§!"

In recent years the powerful DuPont family has taken charge of the organization, allowing greater Social Darwinist influences and using 'Tuckerist' arguments against not only socialists but even Remnant positions and the state itself which they view as too constraining, something old-school Tuckerists have decidedly mixed feelings about when seeing their positions merged with other Sentinel ones.§!"

Drawing on the ideas of Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, Professor W. Z. Ripley, and more, the party advocates a society in which a "Neo-Aristocracy" rules. This class would be made up of superior men and women, and would be accessible through merit. Ideally, such a society would have significant class mobility so that this would be possible, however, the degenerate and mediocre elements of society must, in Stoddard's view, have a different future. Purification of society can only be achieved through segregation and sterilization of these destructive groups. Further, Stoddard envisions the complete destruction of the violent Syndicalist ideology. He has termed supporters of this and other leftist ideologies as "Undermen" and warns that seek to revolt against the natural fabric of society itself. As such, nothing short of complete annihilation of these groups will be enough to save civilization. There is much work to be done, but Stoddard believes he has just the right tools to usher mankind into a new era.§!"

POLITICS_FRANK_BELKNAP_LONG_DESC:0 "A young veteran of the fiction scene and a dominant face in the pulp literary movement alongside his old friend Lovecraft, Frank Belknap Long has risen as the new herald of Lovecraftism. Born in 1901, Long was born in Harlem and became deeply interested in fictional literature while in grade school. Drawing inspiration from not only Lovecraft, but Jules Verne, Bierce, H.G Wells, and Poe as well, Long began writing before reaching high school. Long’s friendship with Lovecraft is longer than most relationships Lovecraft held, for after Long released his story ‘The Eye Above the Mantel’ in 1921, his writings caught the eye of Lovecraft, sparking a decades-old friendship that would see hundreds of correspondence letters exchanged the two as well as frequent trips to visit one another between their respective hubs in Providence and Manhattan. It was around this time that Long was also receiving higher education at NYU and then at Columbia University, until a severe bout of appendicitis nearly killed him, granting him a new view on life. He dropped out of school and began his own freelance sci-fi and pulp fiction writing career which would serve him well over the next few decades, and with Lovecraft supporting him along the way, Long rose to become one of New England’s most prominent fiction authors while also growing closer to our national father and his new political movement - a closeness that secured his position as Lovecraft’s successor. \n\nRefusing to take any of our beloved national father’s epithets or monikers - whether it be ‘Providence’ or the ‘King in Yellow’ or any other title - for such a brazen act of self-righteousness would only spit on the memory of the beloved Howard Philips Lovecraft, Long has instead taken the simple title of ‘Master.’ A move that both represents his authority and his reverence for our late founder while also providing a legitimized facade to our strange nation for all the world to witness, and hopefully acknowledge, Master Long has now set himself up as the logical and most orthodox successor to Lovecraft’s initial vision."
POLITICS_AUGUST_DERLETH_DESC:0 "Once just a small boy from Wisconsin, August William Derleth has risen to become one of the most powerful men in America. Born in 1909, Derleth grew up in Sauk City, writing his first fictional literature at age 13 after being inspired by our beloved Lovecraft, as well as the likes of Poe, Whitman, Dumas, Thoreau, and many others. Initially, his works were unpopular and rejected, but after ‘40 stories and three years’ of practice, Derleth found his niche writing for Weird Tales magazine. Later entering university to get a literary degree, Derleth graduated in 1930, and amid the backdrop of rising factionalism tensions across his home state, Derleth and his lifelong friend Mark Schorer left for New England to study at the Ivy League schools to further their literary careers. The pair rented out an old rustic cabin in rural Rhode Island while studying at Brown, and it is there that he first met Providence. Becoming fast friends, Derleth was brought in to aid Lovecraft in his literary journey and ideological metamorphosis, founding Arkham House publishing together to spread Lovecraft’s message to the world - a dream cut short with Lovecraft’s passing. \n\nNow, succeeding Providence - our Howard Philips Lovecraft - as the new King in Yellow, August Derleth stands as the most dominant and powerful figure in the nation. Taking on a title that was never meant to be formal or regal in any way, this second King in Yellow postures himself as the ‘true heir’ to Lovecraft's so-called eldritch ‘dynasty’ as he seeks to accentuate Lovecraftism’s more cosmic undertones while profiting off of H.L.P’s image and using said image to serve as the foundation for his new ‘moral’ and expanded interpretation of Lovecraft’s ideology."
POLITICS_WHITEHEAD_DESC:0 "An Episcopal minister, the former Archdeacon of the U.S Virgin Islands, a fantastical horror and sword-and-sorcery writer, and now the ‘Eldritch Apostle’ of the nation, Henry St. Clair Whitehead has lived a varied life, and now stands as Lovecraft’s true disciple and successor. Born in 1882 in New Jersey, Whitehead lived a relatively normal childhood in a Christian household, then attended Harvard, where he began his writing career as an editor for a Democratic newspaper, and graduated in 1904. After working as commissioner for the Amateur Athletic Union, Whitehead attended Berkeley Divinity School in Connecticut, being ordained in 1912 as an Episcopal deacon. He then served as a clergyman and rector at two different Connecticut churches before becoming a children’s pastor in NYC. All along this religious journey, Whitehead honed his skills at writing, and finally wound up in St. Croix - the largest of the U.S Virgin Islands - serving as the Archdeacon of the territory. Taking in island myth and occultist traditions, Whitehead fused these ideas into his writing, creating a terrifying literary fusion that captivated his readers - and more importantly, caught the eye of Providence. They continued their correspondence all during Whitehead's tenure as Archdeacon, with Lovecraft even helping many of Whitehead’s works get published in popular pulp magazines like Weird Tales. Returning to the mainland in 1930, Whitehead traveled to New England to escape rising tensions across the nation, and fell in with Lovecraft’s growing circle of influence. Nearly dying of a long-term gastric issue in 1932, Whitehead was able to survive thanks to support from Lovecraft and the best medical care New England - and Lovecraft’s coffer’s - could offer. This generosity sealed his undying loyalty to Lovecraft, with Whitehead beginning to conflate his piety in God and his reverence for his old friend and savior, lifting Lovecraft up as an almost divine figure. \n\nNow, with Providence passing into Elysia, Whitehead has risen as the Eldritch Apostle, seeking to fuse his Christian faith and his faith in Lovecraft into one syncretic idea. Believing Providence to be a physical manifestation of the Lord’s will, or perhaps a new messiah or god, Whitehead is poised to build a new faith for the nation while keeping his occultist influences and interest in Christian Science to heart - a faith that reveres our late King in Yellow as the God Whitehead truly believes He is."

NEE_Civil_War_desc:0"In the wake of Order’s Collapse, New England has descended into anarchy. And out of that Anarchy, the most extreme rise. The main contenders being the Disorganized Republican Resistance, and the Socialist forces to the north. Lovecraft and his Extremely Anglophilic faction appear to be on top, and even has the marginal blessing of the Crown. "

NEE_end_war:0"Secure all of New England"

This will be no easy task, but if we are able to accomplish it, we will be a dominion of immeasurable utility to the Entente, more so than India once was at the height of the British Empire.

NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to be as the American Civil War is tearing up the nation from the coasts on the Pacific to the Texan oilfields to the smoking factories of the Great Lakes. We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston. We may look weak on paper, but it will take every last drop of real American blood to take us down."

NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory:0 "Deploy the Anti-Air Defence System"
NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "Modern War has shown the value of an air force and the massive destruction it can cause upon the armies of old. Whilst we are desperately trying to keep in the air race, our industrial facilities are far smaller than those of our enemies which has prompted High Command to focus instead on the creation of an elaborate Anti-Air defence system capable of nullifying the air superiority of our opponents."

NEE_connecticut_line_desc:0 "Whilst our main defence line lies on the Hudson river, one must always prepare for the unforeseen and as such we should consider creating a line of equal strength behind the Connecticut River.

Boston still stands yet general evacuation of its civilian population has already been decreed.

NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion:0 "Establishing Legitimacy"
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion_desc:0 "We are a government that has been put into place by a foreign power - and thus many are keen to disregard our right to exist, or to call us traitors for not weighing in on the civil war raging in the rest of the nation. We must combat the opinion that we serve British interests rather than American citizens, and that involves changing attitudes at home. Failure to do so means the eventual dissolution of our government once the civil war is finished - or worse.\n\nCurrent Legitimacy :  §G[?NEE.NEE_legitimacy]§!"

NEE_national_propaganda_campaign:0 "Organise a Propaganda Campaign"

NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour_desc:0 "Even as our propaganda ministry works around the clock, the man on the street remains unconvinced that actual power is wielded in Boston and sees the "president" as nothing more than a Canadian sock puppet happily following all orders from Ottawa. By touring the president and the elected cabinet around New England we hope to further convince the people that their real president and leader is very much [NEE.GetLeader]"

NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 "'Motivate' the Foreign Press"
NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the 'New Englander' state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England. This will no longer do for we will not be trifled with and they shall soon recognise that the only true American nation is ours. For now, however we'll have to be content with sliding some money towards the largest troublemakers and politely requesting that they call us the United States of America."

NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Increase Foreign Representation in R&D"
NEE_foreign_representation_desc:0 "The war may be raging harder than ever before but American scientists are still working in the labs and engineering facilities of the Ivy League universities.

#Freedom Fliers
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda:0 "The 'Freedom Fliers'"
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda_desc:0 "The airplane has not only revolutionised the way we travel, transport goods or even wage warfare but also the ways with which we can spread our messages. Through the use of balloons, bombers and even just your regular fighter, the Freedom Fliers initiative has been tasked with flying deep over enemy territory to wage not the physical but the psychological war hoping to disrupt the minds of those that may not fully be on board with the nation they are fighting for."

NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda:0 "Choosing our Message"

Hearkening back to commendable attempts at functional utopias such as the New Philadelphia Colony or our leader’s own Equality Colony, President Norman Lermond has taken power in New England and shall attempt to bring these unique ideals into the modern era. Combining forms of Socialist, Populist, and Grange ideals, Lermond seeks to rebuild New England into a true Socialist Utopia for all of our citizens, with large emphasis being placed on environmentalism, communalism, and unionism while also heavily drawing from the ideas of populist titans such as Edward Bellamy and William Jennings Bryan. Under Lermond, New England shall be made to face true equality, no matter the cost."
NEE_cooperative_management:0 "Cooperative Management"

This does not mean that they shall be filled with fear and greed that surrounds all capitalist pigs across the world as they foolishly and selfishly pursue capital, but instead they shall be made to directly benefit from the policies our nation passes as the capitalist who lorded over us did before. Communalism, cooperative management, and collective ownership shall form the bedrock of our new economy. In this system, all New Englanders will be allowed to revel in the rewards of our economic and industrial development. No longer will the profits of their labors be siphoned away by corporate fatcats, for the people of New England shall finally be made free and equal.

This predatory behavior towards our people’s ingrained trust in their government shall not stand under President Lermond. Populism shall no longer just be venom spewed from the fangs of liars and treacherous snakes, but instead shall be gospel, true and pure, reaching out a hand to all those in need, regardless of creed, belief, or background. We are New Englanders, one and all, and now we shall have a government that follows this absolute truth."
NEE_bellamyist_ideals:0 "Bellamyist Ideals"

Finding common ground in their shared belief in the purity and efficiency of communalism and cooperative living, Lermond has long looked up to the late father of American utopianism. Following in his footsteps, Lermond has looked to Bellamy’s teachings in his pursuit of creating the ideal, just society, integrating Bellamy’s stances on wage slavery, property, division of labor, and many other topics, practically treating Bellamy’s ‘Equality’ as gospel. By bringing Bellamy’s long-dated ideas into the modern era, Lermond seeks to create the first truly equal and just nation-state - a true utopia on Earth."

Growing or herding much of the food that fills our stomachs, it is a travesty how badly previous administrations have treated them, leaving them behind to rot in the dust of their fallow fields. This trampling of the very souls who nourish our people must end! President Lermond has announced a slew of sweeping subsidies and relief programs all aimed at uplifting our agricultural base up and out of poverty and destitution and into a position of living more fitting for these heroes of New England. President Lermond shall reach out a helping hand to every farmer in our great union, ensuring all have the equipment, supplies, capital, and manpower they need to adequately feed our people without being forced to live in squalor."
NEE_annual_income:0 "An Annual Income"
NEE_annual_income_desc:0 "As we continue to draft evermore sweeping reforms and legislation in our bid to remodel New England's society from the ground up, a radical new plan has been brought up within our ranks, with President Lermond giving it greater thought on each suggestion: universal basic income. Drawing on ideas from Bertrand Russell, Clifford Hughes, and Edward Bellamy, President Norman Lermond and his fellow utopists have coalesced their ideas and critiques into a coherent plan to allot a monthly stipend to all adult citizens of New England. This minimum income would potentially guarantee that all of our citizens can at least afford the basic necessities of life each month, allowing them to use their profits earned at work for less critical things. This shall give all New Englanders a taste of the ‘good life’ that the capitalist lords of the past used to enjoy so exclusively; now all New Englanders may taste the sweet bliss of prosperity and wealth."
NEE_local_unions:0 "Promote Local Unions"
NEE_local_unions_desc:0 "Championing the ideas of communalism touted by his idol Bellamy and tested within his own experiments like the Equality Colony or the Industrial Brotherhood and their successful offshoots, President Lermond has begun to enact his plans to wider New England as a whole. Creating ‘local unions’, or communes, across the nation, these communities will form the basis for our new social organization. Grouping locals together into these cooperatives, all would hold equal ownership and rights to everything within the commune, with cooperation being absolutely necessary and beneficial to all within the group. With Lermond’s personal local union, Utopia Park, serving as the model that the rest of the nation will follow, he has shown that even the President himself can live in such a way, shoulder to shoulder with his fellow New Englanders, further selling the idea to the skeptics of our nation."

So ingrained is this love that his famed Utopia Park was founded in and formed around his personal garden, the Knox Arboretum. Holding the sanctity of our environment to the highest of importance, Lermond seeks to spread this appreciation of the biosphere to all New Englanders within our borders. Through the creation of a national park system, state-operated arboretums, pinetums, botanical gardens, and natural preserves shall be established throughout our beauteous wilds, preserving these lands for future generations to enjoy and protect."

Additionally, our regime will further invest into industries made famous in our lands: lumber, shipbuilding, fishing, and farming; these are just some of the native New England industries we must invest in to ensure our prosperity. We will waste no more!"

With the help of the Canadians, we could guarantee our independence, and also achieve the goal of many of our socialists of eliminating syndicalism from the world. After all, the black stain of anarchism has scarred socialism as a whole for far too long, and Lermond believes that it may be time for a reckoning.

NEE_fight_the_mob:0 "Fight the Mob"
NEE_fight_the_mob_desc:0 "The mafia still has a sadly strong presence in New York, with many having been pushed out of New York City. This corruption pollutes our entire political system and though it will not be easy in the short-term it is neccessary to combat it immediately via increased penalties and investigations."
NEE_support_small_business:0 "Support Small Business"

NEE_housing_expansion:0 "Housing Expansions"
NEE_housing_expansion_desc:0 "Our people need housing and the economy needs workers who can afford to live and work in the busiest areas. Low-rent housing will be constructed for American in need to use and to compete with other housing projects, helping keep rents low."
NEE_save_the_constitution:0 "Save the Constitution"
NEE_save_the_constitution_desc:0 "We will not use New England as a separatist project or extremist experiment for New England is a continuation of America. The American constitution will be revived and applied to our 'new', old nation."
NEE_unifying_america:0 "Salute the Red, White and Blue"
NEE_unifying_america_desc:0 "New Englanders have a proud identity yes, but they should think of themselves as Americans first and not forget the tyrants who stole it from us. The American identity will be cultivated and endorsed via education, saluting the American Flag alongside the New England one and propaganda."
NEE_take_on_machines:0 "Investigate the Machines"
NEE_take_on_machines_desc:0 "Sometimes politicians do not need to be paid off by mobsters to be corrupt but do so according to their own accord. The political machines are self-contained forms of political corruption, with James Curley and the Democrats ruling Boston like dictators despite their denial and claims it is not only good, but that we are simply attacking the opposition. They are wrong, for we only target corruption."
NEE_centrist_opinions_for_americans:0 "Centrist Opinions for Americans"
NEE_centrist_opinions_for_americans_desc:0 "Sadly, many Americans did not pay attention to American grievances when they were still reasonable and could have been met through political negotiation. Centrist Opinions for Americans will poll Americans opinions on a broad range of subjects and then alert the establishment as what they are so we can be better within their range, so long as their demands are reasonable."

#Machine Democrats
NEE_democratic_machine:0 "The Democratic Machine"

NEE_irish_ties:0 "Irish Ties"
NEE_irish_ties_desc:0 "It is no secret that New England houses a strong Irish heritage since the influx of immigrants, much of whom reliably vote Democratic. We should cultivate our ties to Ireland, a nation that can view us as equals and with ties to our citizens, rather than counting solely on Canada."
NEE_court_catholics:0 "Court Catholics"
NEE_court_catholics_desc:0 "Catholics make up a sizeable chunk of the New England voting population and have a strong presence in our party. Xenophobic outcries leaves many of them feeling ostracized so we will speak at Catholic Churches, appealing to their communities, bringing the Church into closer ties with the Democratic machine and promoting a renewed crackdown on local Klan members with potential ties to the CAR uprising."
NEE_expand_civil_service:0 "Expand the Civil Service"
NEE_expand_civil_service_desc:0 "While our government is fairly efficient compared to the old US government, an expansion of the civil service will nonetheless allow more efficiency, government jobs and an easier time issuing licenses, projects and regulations."
NEE_public_kickbacks:0 "Public Kickbacks"
NEE_public_kickbacks_desc:0 "With the civil service expanded we should try to aid those with the closest loyalties to the current government. Much of these funds will help build communities, provide contracts to allies and give needed welfare while promoting negotiating with the Democratic Party, rather than turning ones back on it or thwarting it."
NEE_invest_in_the_wards:0 "Invest in the Wards"
NEE_invest_in_the_wards_desc:0 "The wards are often the most urban areas of our nation and are in constant need of new housing and infrastructure, and often are the most vital voters to win over. A reinvestment in the wards will allow for infrastructure updates and repairs alongside improved housing."
NEE_union_ties:0 "Union Ties"
NEE_union_ties_desc:0 "Our ties to the non-syndicalist unions were essential to our victory but sadly not all such groups endorsed us. Providing contract work to loyal unions while improving our relations with them and other unions who can be flipped into the machines patronage system will provide the working man with wages and us with votes."
NEE_tacit_agreement:0 "A Tacit Agreement"
NEE_tacit_agreement_desc:0 "The mafia should not be celebrated for their actions, obviously, but they will always exist in some form and outright fighting them would hurt more than it helps. A tacit agreement should be made for them to keep bloodshed to a minimum and away from civilians (especially near election day) in return for tolerating 'victimless' crimes would give the common man much security."
NEE_powers_of_the_governor:0 "Powers of the Governor"
NEE_powers_of_the_governor_desc:0 "The problem with the old American constitution is that it bestowed too much power on a bickering Congress and not enough on the executive powers that actually allocate resources. The governors of each state will be empowered at the cost of Congress, alongside Mayors and, of course, the President, to give them more control over the public purse."
NEE_third_national_bank:0 "Third National Bank"
NEE_third_national_bank_desc:0 "America has had two national banks and in the case of the second it was dismantled for being too pro-banker. This was fair but times have changed and a national bank would go far in helping control economic instability and the financial system. As such the New England National Bank will be created at once."
NEE_immigrant_aid:0 "Immigrant Aid"
NEE_immigrant_aid_desc:0 "Sadly not all immigrants are treated well when they arrive in our fine nation. Immigrants however can make for fine voters and should be treated as such, so while immigrant rates can't be too high to appease our other voters those poor that do appear should receive brief welfare aid and an easier time finding a job via machine outreach."
NEE_raise_minimum_wage:0 "A Federal Minimum Wage"
NEE_raise_minimum_wage_desc:0 "A federal minimum wage will kill two birds with one stone by making it both more difficult for low-wage workers to undercut union wages while also providing them with higher wages of their own. As such it will help secure our support among the working class while undercutting syndicalism."
NEE_expand_the_machines:0 "Enlarge the Patronage Machine"
NEE_expand_the_machines_desc:0 "With the Democratic Party dominant on the federal level it is time to expand the patronage machine outside of traditional working-class Democratic strongholds by expanding machine politics to new urban regions and even to more rural farmers who can use the machine to gain needed benefits and subsidies as well as creating more middle-class functionaries in the party."

#Radicals
NEE_radical_victory:0 "Radical Victory"
NEE_radical_victory_desc:0 "The syndicalists and loyalists have been pushed back and it's the Radical Coalition between the Freemen (AKA the Remnant) and the Sentinels of the Republic we have to thank for it! They have seized power but ideological differences between the two must be settled if we are to proceed."
NEE_the_remnant:0 "The Remnant"
NEE_the_remnant_desc:0 "The Remnant, a monikor given to the followers of Albert Jay Nock's interpretition of Jeffersonian values, have come out on top of the Constitutional Congress. They promess a minimalist state that only exists to ensure liberty, heavy states rights and deregulation of the economy."
NEE_the_single_tax:0 "A Single Tax"
NEE_the_single_tax_desc:0 "The income tax, the excise tax, the estate tax, is their any end to what governments will take from hard-working citizens? There is only one tax that is just, the land value tax, for land is not created by anyone. Let us boot out the other taxes and enact the Vision of Henry George!"
NEE_nightwatchman_state:0 "Nightwatchman State"
NEE_nightwatchman_state_desc:0 "It is truly disgusting the extent governments attempt to control their citizens for the greater good while encouraging worse vices in the process. It's time to end the long list of arbitrary, moralizing laws against liquor, dancing, prostitution, drugs and other petty regulations for the good of liberty and to focus on fighting theft, fraud and aggression."
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy:0 "Defend Liberty from Democracy"
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy_desc:0 "We can not allow the populace to be cojouled into voting away their freedoms as so many other states have done! The Bill of Rights must see an expansion that covers economic freedoms related to property owning, trade and greater individual autonomy from government to prevent this, though some will call for us to go a step further."
NEE_decentralized_currency:0 "Decentralized Currency"
NEE_decentralized_currency_desc:0 "The centralization of currency under the federal government after the end of the Articles of Confederation lead to its logical conclusion in the tyrant Wilson created the Federal Reserve. No more! The States now have the right to create their own currency and trade amongst themselves while the Federal Dollar will merely be used to help maintain base neccesities related to military and law enforcement, and placed on a stricter gold standard to keep it in check."
NEE_state_militias:0 "State Militias"
NEE_state_militias_desc:0 "The Federal Government should maintain as small a military as possible as to defend our shores. However, a large military under the federal government could be tyrannical and thus instead we should have the bulk of our forces raised by state militias. They will keep the government in check, encourage civi virtue and their locality to what they're defending will make them harder defenders."
NEE_private_initative:0 "The Pursuit of Happiness"
NEE_private_initative_desc:0 "Government intervention in the economy has caused far more damage than good. Private initiative will pick up where government price distortions leave off, thus granting an opportunity for work and wealth to more private citizens. Likewise, the last remaining red tape shall be slashed, especially with regards to tariffs, arbitrary government standards and regulation of 'public' utilities."
NEE_end_public_schooling:0 "Nockian Education"
NEE_end_public_schooling_desc:0 "The public school system has been an abysmal failure, wasting children's time on pointless tasks and instilling them with federalist propaganda. Any schooling should be up each community that can focus on those with their needs or those with the greatest potential while higher education should be held to as high a standard as possible. No longer shall we finance public schooling."
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy:0 "Jeffersonian Confederacy"
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy_desc:0 "It is time to enshrine a real Constitution, one based on Jeffersonianism. The President will be a figurehead of the nation for times of war, Congress dealing with military defense and foreign policy and the vast majority of powers resting with the States, with the final federal economic laws overturned in the process and the state legislatures becoming more political empowered."
NEE_declaration_of_independence:0 "A Declaration of Independence"
NEE_declaration_of_independence_desc:0 "We did not fight off the socialists just to live under the Redcoats! We fought off the loyalists and we can the same to the English monarchy just as we did after 1776 if they are foolish enough to have not learned their lesson the first time and not accept the Second Declaration of Independence."
NEE_the_sentinels_of_the_republic:0 "The Sentinels of the Republic"
NEE_the_sentinels_of_the_republic_desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events to the nation the Sentinels of the Republic under Irénée du Pont are now at the helm of our nation! With most of them influenced by variants of Benjamin Tucker's Egoism they promise the destruction of what they view as the final obstacle to freedom, the state itself."
NEE_expand_the_organization:0 "Expand the Organization"
NEE_expand_the_organization_desc:0 "The Sentinels are the last defenders of real liberty in our republic, from threats both domestic and foreign! However, many uninformed citizens are still painfully unaware of this. We should spread the word as widely as possible through radio, pamphlets and even private relations for citizens to join the Sentinels and enjoy the benefits of doing so, especially those productive businessmen who should stand with us against statists."
NEE_private_defense_forces:0 "Private Defense Forces"
NEE_private_defense_forces_desc:0 "The state military system is a failure, being notable disloyal by accepting any government that takes power, a threat to liberty and soaking up absurd amounts of resources. Instead private defense contractors should take their place. While this will shrink the military it still leave the most qualified for fighting, and after corresponding tax cuts the Sentinel Organization will keep in the employ as many military men as it can afford, choosing quality over quantity. Those who desire protection can either pay us or go to another."
NEE_beyond_privatization:0 "Beyond Privatization"
NEE_beyond_privatization_desc:0 "We are not merely going to put an end to tariffs and public utilities as the Freemen propose. No, we will go a step further than that. Yes, the roads and current public goods will be privatized, but alongside them virtually all laws related to economic regulation will be struck down. It is time for the Invisible Hand to take precendence."
NEE_dissolving_the_state:0 "Dissolving the State"
NEE_dissolving_the_state_desc:0 "It is time. The court system, the remnants of public defense, the public police, taxes and the last regulations will be done away with, both at the Federal and state level. The largest monopoly in the land will finally be dismantled and instead man will finally be able to act out his will under true liberty."
NEE_might_makes_right:0 "Right of Might"
NEE_might_makes_right_desc:0 "The Sentinels must protect the new status quo at all costs! Of course, man has a right to either lose or take that land which can not be defended so let us defend it well. The Sentinels will take over lands bordering us that refuse to pay the appropriate protection fees and use it to further fund private defenses against foreign enemies."
NEE_crush_statists:0 "Crush Statists"
NEE_crush_statists_desc:0 "The enemies of liberty have not left us simply because the state is gone. No, our enemies amongst in the Democratic wards, 'liberal' Businessmen, Socialistic Unions and English loyalists are still amongst us. A campaign by the largest military force in the territory, the Sentinels, to strike their organizations and seize their assets, will be a boon to liberty."
NEE_right_of_contract:0 "Right of Contract"
NEE_right_of_contract_desc:0 "While the right to take by force is always on the table, it can be quite costly compared to signing a contract. The Right of Contract is an informal right that allows both ourselves and the people of the New England to settle their differences via signed agreement. While we obviously can not put this into law we can set an example by spreading and honoring our business deals as widely as possible."
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid:0 "A Fee for our Aid"
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid_desc:0 "The Canadians insist that we act as a bulwark against syndicalism. While the Syndicalists are considered a great evil we should not simply do their bidding for free. If they and others who are opposed to syndicalism want our aid they should pay for the privilege."
NEE_hostile_takeover:0 "Hostile Takeover"
NEE_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "Some wealthy families, notably the Astors, refuse to join the Sentinels or respect us. They believe Canada or their family guards give them the right to ignore us. If they will put forward their resources to defend the new liberty then we will take over their assets and put it to better use. May the better man win."
NEE_expanded_labor_pool:0 "New Labor Pools"
NEE_expanded_labor_pool_desc:0 "Too many citizens behave as if the old standards are still in place with regards to labor agreements. But with labor freed of government standards all who desire to work can, including most importantly the very young whom have a right to our labor contracts as soon as they are old enough to understand them and sign. We will set a fine example by providing work for these little ones."
NEE_lothrop_stoddard:0 "The Nordic League"
NEE_lothrop_stoddard_desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events, Lothrop Stoddard and his eugenicist Nordic Party have come to power in New England. Supporting a platform of racial segregation and eventually purification, they will work to ensure the very survival of civilization!"
NEE_block_foreign_hordes:0 "Block Foreign Hordes"
NEE_block_foreign_hordes_desc:0 "Our peril is clear: the other races are reproducing at a worrying rate, far faster than that of the Nordics. There is little we can do about this state of affairs, given our own measly power, but we do control our own territory. We must bar these inferior elements, and turn them away. Should we include our own countrymen, however?" 
NEE_racial_catalogues:0 "Racial Catalogues"
NEE_racial_catalogues_desc:0 "It is time for a different type of census. We will endeavor to create new racial classifications, established along the lines of Stoddard's previous works, that will divide our society from now on. This will allow for greater ease in purifying our nation at a later date. We also must decide the place of each of these groups, once we have decided how to categorize them."
NEE_embrace_science:0 "Embrace Science"
NEE_embrace_science_desc:0 "For too long, society has been ruled by passion, prejudice, and unreason. We must eliminate these illogical ideas and work towards the betterment of society through the promotion of science. In particular, we must advance the fields of Medicine, Psychology, and most of all, Biology. Through this effort, we can improve our methods of Eugenics, so that we may better our civilization."
NEE_help_the_kkk:0 "Help the Klan"
NEE_help_the_kkk_desc:0 "The Constitutional American Republic has been the main front for the Ku Klux Klan in the American Civil War. However, Stoddard believes the Klan could use some assistance from his own territory, not to mention their potential benefits for New England, and we should decide how we wish to aid them. They will surely be happy to return the favor..."
NEE_american_birth_control_league:0 "American Birth Control League"
NEE_american_birth_control_league_desc:0 "The A.B.C.L. is an institution that gives women the opportunity to control whether or not they have children, and such an organization is just what Lothrop Stoddard needs. We must make sure that only worthy mothers have children, and one child raised in a prosperous family will always be preferable to three children raised in poverty. Let us embrace this organization on a national level." 
NEE_neo_aristocracy:0 "The Neo-Aristocracy"
NEE_neo_aristocracy_desc:0 "New advances in the field of science have exposed democracy for the sham it is. Now, that institution is even more challenged than it was after the Weltkrieg, and meanwhile, aristocracy has been validated as the logical form of government. However, this does not mean arbitrary inequality-rather, we shall have natural rule by a class of superior men and women, and those with the talent to rise will have the ability to do so."
NEE_southern_purity:0 "Southern Purity"
NEE_southern_purity_desc:0 "The South is one of the few regions left in which the old American stock continues to grow. In New England, the Midwest, and elsewhere, immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe have diluted the population. We should emulate the South and promote a pure Anglo-Saxon populace, with some immigration from Northern and Western Europe to help bolster our numbers."
NEE_sterilize_the_masses:0 "Sterilize the Degenerate Masses"
NEE_sterilize_the_masses_desc:0 "The process of purification must be a gradual one, but the first step will be to sterilize the worst degenerates in the population-the unadaptable, the inferior, and the disabled. These elements will be segregated, miscegenation of any sort shall be banned, and we will use the advances in birth contol technology when necessary, all in the pursuit of purification." 
NEE_positive_eugenics:0 "Positive Eugenics"
NEE_positive_eugenics_desc:0 "Eugenics is not all about limiting populations; in fact, "Positive" eugenics shall entail the multiplication of superior classes. We must encourage reproduction among these groups with the same enthusiasm we take towards the sterilization of the inferior classes, for one cannot work without the other, and through our efforts, we will create a new progressive civilization!"
NEE_stomp_the_undermen:0 "Stomp the 'Undermen'"
NEE_stomp_the_undermen_desc:0 "The phenomenon known as "Syndicalism" is not new in any sense of the word. In fact, it is only a continuation of the historical revolt of the Under-Man. The Under-Man is he who denies the advances of science, he who resents natural superiority and acts to overthrow the natural order. These men have taken power in France and Britain, but we shall not allow them to prevail here! We must do everything in our power to crush these elements, for they are the enemy of civilization itself!"
NEE_war_against_chaos:0 "War Against Chaos"
NEE_war_against_chaos_desc:0 "We face a titanic struggle today. It is the struggle between the civilized world and those who would see us return to more primitive times. These Under-Men, unable to accept the loss of the moral or scientific high-ground, have increasingly resorted to force to get their way, and this is intolerable. We must take intelligent action against these degenerates by spreading the truth about the threat they pose."
NEE_hereditary_intellect:0 "Hereditary Intellect"
NEE_hereditary_intellect_desc:0 "Just as many forms of insanity have been proven to be hereditary, so too is intellect. If we allow the environment to take precedence over inherited capacity, we will be fostering a decline in our civilization! No, we must promote the idea of intellect through heredity, an idea first gifted to us by the Greeks and now proven by science. After all, you cannot make greatness out of mediocrity..."
NEE_selective_subsidies:0 "Selective Subsidies"
NEE_selective_subsidies_desc:0 "Birth rates in our Nordic elements have stagnated as of late. Though this may not be such a problem in an ideal society, it is a problem when the inferior classes reproduce so rapidly. By granting subsidies to the groups we want to reproduce and rewarding them for doing so, we can further the cause of Positive eugenics."
NEE_progressive_civilization:0 "Progressive Civilization"
NEE_progressive_civilization_desc:0 "We have taken the first steps towards a truly progressive civilization! It may be decades or even centuries before our true vision is reached, but we have begun the important work of separating the inferior from the superior, encouraging the multiplication of superior persons, and vanquishing the rebellious Under-Man, who has afflicted civilization since its very inception. Towards a shining future for our country!"
NEE_natural_inequality:0 "Natural Inequality"
NEE_natural_inequality_desc:0 "The flaws in democracy and aristocracy were their promotion of "natural equality" and "artifical inequality" respectively. Instead, we will promote a society in which merit determines your place, merit that is given to a person before they are ever born, determined by heredity. The superior man shall rise regardless of his place at birth, and the mediocre and degenerate classes will have their place as well until such a time as they are eliminated."

NEE_WASP_desc:0 "The birthplace of American feminism lies in Seneca, in upstate New York. We need to ensure that patriotic women can contribute to the war effort just as their male counterparts.

NEE_submarine_effort_desc:0 "An incremental improvement over the previous Porpoise class, they will be the first American submarine class to achieve 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant, allowing them to operate with the Standard-type battleships of the surface fleet. Their range of over 11.000 Nautical miles also further makes them the prime submarine in operations from the Atlantic to the Pacific."

NEE_US_Airforce_desc:0 "Although we have little experience with the use of aircraft in military operations, the Weltkrieg has shown its crucial role on the battlefield and years of continued research and development in the field has led to the creation of our own air force.

NEE_Air_Defence_Command:0 "Establish Air Defence Command"

NEE_ISAC_Equipement_desc:0 "The Canadian ISAC initiative has established itself as a veritable authority in the field of armament research and its production capacity and technological knowhow still leave us far behind.

NEE_Self_Reliance:0 "Self-Reliance"
NEE_Self_Reliance_desc:0 "We are an American nation, not some Canadian puppet, and allowing ourselves to become too complacent in arms development by benefitting from Canadian expertise will become a problem should we one day be forced into combat with the rest of America and find ourselves technologically behind our northern allies."

NEE_bureau_of_industry:0 "Bureau of Central Planning"
NEE_bureau_of_industry_desc:0 "Public works programs are a good way of ensuring that unemployment does not breed radicalism.

NEE_Settlement_Movement_desc:0 "The Settlement Movement of the 1920s tried to bring the rich and poor of society together in both physical and social proximity. Its main object was the establishment of 'settlement houses' in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class 'settlement workers' would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and alleviate the poverty of, their low-income neighbors.

Adna "Father" Chaffee, General John J. Pershing, Ernest "Old Gravel Voice" Harmon, and politician Theodore F. Green are in the running, and the decision has come: who to appoint?"
NEE_appoint_chaffee:0 "Father Chaffee"
NEE_appoint_chaffee_desc:0 "Adna R. Chaffee has been an avid horseman his whole life. Now, however, he urges us to embrace the future. Chaffee is specifically concerned with tanks. He argues that a tank force will allow New England to glide across the vast North American terrain and the smaller battlefields of Western Europe alike. Father Chaffee will lead us to victory."
NEE_mechanical_cavalry:0 "Mechanical Cavalry"
NEE_mechanical_cavalry_desc:0 "Real wars are fought by real men, not solely by tanks. However, we can still use technology to serve these men. As horses served armies in the past, let us send trucks and motorized vehicles alongside our troops. This will make them faster and better supplied. We will strike the enemy with lightning speed."
NEE_coordination_principal:0 "The Coordination Principle"
NEE_coordination_principal_desc:0 "As the foremost power in the world, Germany's military should be something to emulate. Some German officials believe that airplanes should work together with infantry and tanks, in order to strike the enemy before they even understand what is coming. Let us emulate this tactic. This will greatly aid our inter-branch cooperation and experience."
NEE_experimental_organization:0 "Experimental Divisions"
NEE_experimental_organization_desc:0 "Father Chaffee has relentlessly pressed us to not only modernize our vehicles, but to experiment with new ones.

A staunch supporter of New English autonomy within the Entente, he has his own plan for our military.

NEE_infantry_investments:0 "Infantry Research Developments"
NEE_infantry_investments_desc:0 "Some of our officials want us to focus on tanks or artillery. Pershing disagrees. He is quick to point out that in his day, infantry were the driving force behind armies, and he believes they still are. To that end, he has encouraged us to invest in new infantry technology, so each and every one of our soldiers can have an edge over his foe. Pershing is confident that his old tactics can still rout any enemy we face." 
NEE_streamlined_staff:0 "Streamlined Staff"
NEE_streamlined_staff_desc:0 "General Pershing has been given a new rank in our army, as a result of his loyalty and his experience.

NEE_natural_defenses:0 "Natural Defenses"
NEE_natural_defenses_desc:0 "New England is a place of varied geography. The Hudson River and the Catskills mountains on our southern border can serve as a natural defense against any who dare cross our border.

NEE_breakthrough_emphasis:0 "Breakthrough Emphasis"
NEE_breakthrough_emphasis_desc:0 "As a man who has been a senior officer in the military long enough to see the Weltkrieg come and go, General Pershing believes breakthroughs are a crucial part of warfare.

NEE_long_range_logistics:0 "Long-Range Logistics"
NEE_long_range_logistics_desc:0 "To win any modern war, we must be prepared for large fronts. With tanks and planes, we can help our army push deep into enemy lines.

NEE_expand_westpoint:0 "Expand Westpoint"
NEE_expand_westpoint_desc:0 "General Pershing graduated from Westpoint over 50 years ago. Despite this, he has never lost his belief in the institution as a necessity for any aspiring officer.

NEE_american_marksmenship:0 "American Marksmenship"
NEE_american_marksmenship_desc:0 "A well-trained army has scouts, and a well-trained modern army has snipers. It also has soldiers who rarely miss.

NEE_iron_discipline:0 "Iron Discipline"
NEE_iron_discipline_desc:0 "Though we may not have the manpower or the industrial capacity of our rivals, we have something they can not match.

With an unbreakable will and iron discipline, New England will never be beaten."
NEE_merit_promotion:0 "Promotion by Merit"
NEE_merit_promotion_desc:0 "An effective military should always issue promotions based on merit, not bloodline. Such a tradition is deeply American, and is also practiced by the mightiest army on Earth.

NEE_black_combat_troops:0 "Black Combat Training"
NEE_black_combat_troops_desc:0 "Pershing is in favor of a "separate-but-equal" approach to Black soldiers. He has encouraged the creation of all-black units and insists that their training is indeed equal to that of any other soldier. This will encourage Black soldiers from our rivals to flee here, he notes, because they will have more control within their own units. Whether he is right or not is yet to be seen."
NEE_assault_the_line:0 "Assault the Line"
NEE_assault_the_line_desc:0 "Trench Warfare is still relevant today, as it was in the Weltkrieg. Unlike those poor souls, our soliders will not lose their lives fighting for mere feet or even inches of land. Instead, we will make sure we can break any line we face.

With a focus on these things, Old Gravel Voice knows that we will blow our enemies to smithereens."
NEE_integrated_armor:0 "Integrated Armor"
NEE_integrated_armor_desc:0 "Tanks are fairly new to warfare, but have similar explosive potential to artillery. Put together, the forces can bring hellfire on our enemy.

NEE_decisive_tactics:0 "Tactical Decisiveness"
NEE_decisive_tactics_desc:0 "If there is any lesson that should be learned from the Weltkrieg, it is that the enemy should be destroyed decisively before they have a chance to dig in.

NEE_artillery_line:0 "Artillery Offensive"
NEE_artillery_line_desc:0 "Harmon argues that an investment in artillery would go a long way in breaking through to the south, or in any other theater of war. With artillery coming first, the enemy line will be like melted butter, and our infantry will be the knife that slices through it."
NEE_counter_attack:0 "Counter-Attack Bias"
NEE_counter_attack_desc:0 "General Hermon believes that if our men are being pushed back, they should fire with overwhelming artillery force to hold the line and even push the enemy back. In fact, Harmon prefers this strategy, noting it allows the enemy to fall into our artillery's waiting jaws."

NEE_armored_spearhead_desc:0 "Though he emphasizes use of artillery and airplanes, Hermon is also a strong proponent of armored warfare. He believes that our tanks can punch holes in enemy lines that can be followed up on by planes, artillery, and infantry, in order to overwhelm our enemy. Let us train our men and build our equipment to serve this purpose."
NEE_mechanical_drawing:0 "Westpoint Engineering"
NEE_mechanical_drawing_desc:0 "Westpoint is one of the greatest military institutions in the world, but officers are not the only graduates. There are also engineers with crucial knowledge that could bolster our war effort. Giving more funding to Westpoint and encouraging engineering as a career will help our military overcome some of the greatest annoyances we can encounter in war."
NEE_bombing_support:0 "Bombing Support"
NEE_bombing_support_desc:0 "We shall bomb our enemy into submission until they praise the lord. Airplanes can carry heavier loads than ever before, and Old Gravel Voice insists we use this fact to our advantage. Let us fill the sky with planes and make sure that the enemy is soft for our ground forces."
NEE_firepower_purchase:0 "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
NEE_firepower_purchase_desc:0 "We will purchase tanks, artillery, motorized vehicles, and other equipment such as bullets to make sure our men are never out of ammo. With this effort, we can win against our more numerous rivals, as we will have many bullets for every soldier they can throw our way. Every soldier shall shout "pass the ammunition!" and we will fire until the enemy is eviscerated."

NEE_green_policy:0 "Green Policy"
NEE_green_policy_desc:0 "Theodore F. Green may not be a general, but he is one of our foremost politicians. A committed internationalist, he wishes to see New England take its rightful place on the world stage. To do that, Green knows we need a large army, to compete with our rivals. He has pushed legislation ramping up conscription to begin this effort."
NEE_consistant_conscription:0 "Consistent Conscription"
NEE_consistant_conscription_desc:0 "Green's bill has passed, and we are now conscripting our young men to build a larger army than ever before. None of our rivals will outnumber us. With such a force, we can project power up and down the East Coast and perhaps across the Atlantic, should we decide to help the Entente retake Europe."
NEE_moral_idealism:0 "Moral Idealism"
NEE_moral_idealism_desc:0 "We will fight the good fight, the right fight. The values of America that were once so important to her citizens are still important to us, and we will carry them with us everywhere we go. Let us show Canada our commitment to the fight against Syndicalism. Our commitment to international institutions has never been stronger!"
NEE_yankee_nationalism:0 "Yankee Patriotism"
NEE_yankee_nationalism_desc:0 "We are Yankees, and we are proud of it. Reactionaries to the south use this term in a derogatory meaning, but to New Englanders, it is part of our identity. Though we now fight with our old rulers, we will never forget we became in the meantime."
NEE_farmer_soldiers:0 "Farmers into Soldiers"
NEE_farmer_soldiers_desc:0 "Farmers should not be exempt from the draft. They are some of our strongest citizens, and could serve us well in the military. Besides, we could use all the men we can get, or so Green says. This will certainly provide us with more manpower, but it may have negative effects on our population's ability to eat."
NEE_silver_military_lease:0 "Silver Lease"
NEE_silver_military_lease_desc:0 "Let us release silver that the government owns, in order to help serve our war effort. Now that we have manpower in our military, Green wants us to also ramp up miiltary spending quite a bit, to pay for all the new equipment we will need. We have grudgingly done this, with the understanding that all this money will be put to good use."
NEE_mass_spending:0 "Mass Spending"
NEE_mass_spending_desc:0 "Green has seen our willingness to give him increased military spending, and he has run with it. He now makes impassioned speeches calling for a great increase in military spending, so that we can have the largest military in all of North America. While his goal may be outlandish for now, we cannot deny that he has a sort of point. Let us increase the spending once again."

The Canadian government has sent us notification of their intent, and has stressed that they only wish to safeguard the lives of innocents and that they will discuss the matter further with the American government once peace has been restored.

Apparently they went so far as to formally request an intervention by [CAN.GetNameDef], but the Canadian government has declined to get involved... at least as of yet.

The states have suggested setting up a provisional government for the region, one that would - at least initially - be under our control and brought into the Entente alliance. Some members of the government, however, have suggested it would be better if we simply occupied and adminstered the territory ourselves.

### Flavor Events ####

newengland.40.t:0 "The Great New England Hurricane of 1938"
newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all."

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."
newengland.41.a:0 "We shall adapt to the British model."
newengland.41.b:0 "American cars drive on the side of Freedom!"


newengland.42.t:0 "Royal visit to New England"
newengland.42.d:0 "King-Emperor Edward the 8th and his wife Isabelle of Orleans have arrived in Boston today to mark improved ties between New England and Canada. This is the first time that a reigning British monarch has visited Boston in its entire history. As to be expected large jubilant crowds of New Englanders have come out to catch a sight of the King and Queen of the British Empire. The visit was more then just seeing the sites of the sites for they also came to discuss politics with the various leaders of note in New England."
newengland.42.a:0 "Welcome to Boston!"

newengland.44.t:0 "The [GetYear] World Series"
newengland.44.d:0 "America's Pastime is alive and well in New England as the Boston Red Sox are set to play the World Series of [GetYear] against their crosstown rival, the Bees, in a seven game series. When baseball was effectively canceled at the outbreak of civil war down south, the Red Sox remained safely in Boston and as such were unaffected. Despite finishing sixth out of eight in the American League last year, the Red Sox trounced the competition in the inaugural season of the New England League, led by superstar Jimmie Foxx and tactical genius Joe Cronin. Rounding out the league were six recently promoted baseball clubs from the former minor leagues from cities such as Buffalo, Rochester, and Albany as well as the aforementioned Bees, whose level of play last season was a similar caliber to that of the Red Sox but were unfortunate enough to be playing in Philadelphia at the outset of the war and as such were unable to return most of their best players to New England. Some say the Red Sox are cursed, however, as they have yet to replicate their success after selling superstar Babe Ruth in 1919 to finance their owner's musical production and have fallen on hard times ever since.  While some say the defunct American and National Leagues retain the rights to the actual World Series title, who are they to judge? They don't exist anymore. As far as everyone is concerned, whoever wins this Series are world champions."
newengland.44.a:0 "Here's hoping for a good series!"

newengland.45.t:0 "Boston Red Sox win the [GetYear] World Series"
newengland.45.d:0 "In what has come as no surprise, the Boston Red Sox have won the [GetYear] World Series. Led by stellar performances by Jimmie Foxx and pitcher Lefty Grove, the Red Sox have swept the Bees in four easy games, including a decisive game four at Fenway Park where they outscored their opponent by sixteen runs and squashing accusations of a nonsense 'curse' in the process."
newengland.45.a:0 "The curse reversed."

newengland.46.t:0 "Boston Bees win the [GetYear] World Series"
newengland.46.d:0 "In an amazing upset, the Boston Bees have somehow managed to defeat the Red Sox in seven games after an unfortunate gaffe by Red Sox first baseman Jimmie Foxx let the final out of the last game roll between his legs, handing the Bees their first championship since they were known as the Braves in 1914. Foxx, the longtime Red Sox star, was seen crying outside Fenway Park after the game while the Bees celebrated through the evening and into the night. He was only consoled after a teammate reminded him it could be much worse. He could be down south."
newengland.46.a:0 "Maybe they are cursed...?"

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."
newengland.50.a:0 "There is only so much we can do though..."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island."
newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the far side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program."

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in [CSA.GetNameDef] and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon."

#TEX
newengland.56.t:0 "Refugees from the AUS"
newengland.56.d:0 "Although the journey is full of peril and even though bandits and/or criminals stalk the trails from the Great Plains all the way to Connecticut, thousands still depart on the journey hoping that they may find peace and a protector in our nation."
newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in."
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organizations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organizations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet laureate"
newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favour for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59_lovecraft:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The Obvious choice is H.P Lovecraft, the leader of our nation that has both thrilled and terrified us with his works. Lovecraft, however has written in the papers that he does not care whether he receives the award. If not Lovecraft, the head candidate is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master."
newengland.59.b:0 "H.P Lovecraft, the master of horror."

newengland.60.t:0 "Intervention for John Winant"
newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."
newengland.60.a:0 "He just need a few days off."

newengland.61.t:0 "Gerry Campaigns for Mackenzie King"
newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry. Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisers about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "
newengland.61.a:0 "Don't cross party lines!"
newengland.61.b:0 "Gerry can campaign as he pleases."

newengland.62.t:0 "Cocoanut Grove fire traced back to Tobin"
newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."
newengland.62.a:0 "A shame upon the city."

newengland.63.t:0 "Rockefeller Center artifacts recovered, some defaced"
newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."
newengland.63.a:0 "I'll get you Rivera, someday!"

newengland.64.t:0 "Canadians apply for West Point"
newengland.64.d:0 "The Class of 1944 has just arrived, and their numbers are far below expectations. As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honored tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."
newengland.64.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
newengland.64.b:0 "We do need the people."

### Freedom Fliers ###
newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing our Propaganda"
newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."
newengland.70.a:0 "Attempt to disrupt their attack plans with wrong information."
newengland.70.b:0 "Trick their troops in leaving gaps in their defences."
newengland.70.c:0 "Spread uncertainty on their Home Front."
newengland.70.e:0 "Try to demoralise their troops."

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the 'Freedom Fliers'"
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."
newengland.72.a:0 "Assign them the resources!"
newengland.72.b:0 "It's too risky."

newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Garrison!"

newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."
newengland.80.a:0 "This will amount to nothing."
newengland.80.b:0 "Bah, very well - set up the provisional government."

newengland.81.t:0 "Riots throughout New England"
newengland.81.d:0 "Throughout the cities of New England there are major protests and riots protesting the occupation of the Canadian Forces in the region. In a number of cities these protests have turned violent and it looks like things are getting worse. It does not look like these protests are going to end anytime soon."
newengland.81.a:0 "Blasted Yankees"

newengland.82.t:0 "Actions of the Yankee Resistance"
newengland.82.d:0 "The resistance of the New England population against our occupation forces continues. Once again, terrorist groups operating within New England have staged a number of attacks aimed on crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output and the morale of our forces."
newengland.82.a:0 "Freaking Yankees!"

newengland.83.t:0 "Attack by Yankee guerrillas!"
newengland.83.d:0 "The Yankee insurrectionists in New England have launched a full-on assault against our occupation forces!"
newengland.83.a:0 "Damn Them!"

newengland.84.t:0 "Major Yankee Offensive!"
newengland.84.d:0 "We are under attack! Throughout New England a major coordinated uprising has occurred in every city from Boston to Bangor to Buffalo. Our soldiers and leaders are under attack throughout New England. A number of leaders in Canada are requesting we begin to re-examine how we are ruling over the New Englanders."
newengland.84.a:0 "Bloody Yankees!"

newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages. We should see no further trouble in the area."
newengland.85.a:0 "Finally!"

newengland.90.d.forced:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs. There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
newengland.90.b:0 "We should rejoin America."
newengland.90.c:0 "No, this is not in our best interests."

newengland.91.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
newengland.91.d:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well."
newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente."
newengland.91.c:0 "No, we cannot permit that."

newengland.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
newengland.92.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request."
newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand."

newengland.95.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.95.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned with agreement - they will join the Entente in exchange for a peaceful reunion with New England, and as a way to pay back [Root.GetNameDef] for safeguarding so many American lives during the civil war."
newengland.95.a:0 "Might amenable of them!"

newengland.96.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.96.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against radical forces, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
newengland.96.a:0 "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
newengland.96.b:0 "Very well, let them go."
newengland.96.c:0 "Then we refuse."

newengland.97.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.97.d.forced:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
newengland.97.d.choice:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more. Now the New England government must decide for itself where its interests lie, and perhaps spark a war either way."
newengland.97.a:0 "So be it!"
newengland.97.b:0 "We will join [requester.GetNameDef] anyhow!"
newengland.97.c:0 "We remain with [From.GetNameDef]"

newengland.98.t:0 "New England Dissolves"
newengland.98.d:0 "With our refusal to allow New England to rejoin [requester.GetNameDef], their government has utterly dissolved due to internal conflict and a sense of it having no true legitimacy.

newengland.99.t:0 "[war_country.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.99.d.exists:0 "For reasons not well understood, the New England government has decided that its best interests are served remaining a part of the British sphere.

newengland.99.d.notexists:0 "While it appears New Englanders were more than willing to join with us peacefully, the Canadian intervention has exposed their provisional government for what it was: a puppet, subject to the will of the British crown.

newengland.101.t:0 "Syndicalist Revolts Increase!"
newengland.101.d:0 "While with Canadian backing we have managed to re-establish some order in the region syndicalist strikers are nonetheless extremely active in Massachusetts and militants are receiving support from the Combined Syndicates of America, with Leonard Abbott apparently organizing revolts against us from New York City, with rumors he plans to call on the workers to rise up at once and join the CSA. Even worse, Norman Wallace Lermond, a native of Maine and a famous naturalist, has called for a moderate socialist revolution within New England, though it seems he has no intentions of joining with the CSA. With the IWW and Socialist Parties still causing problems it is clear we are not out of the woods yet, and governor [NEE.GetLeader] has declared that anyone who attempts to overthrow the government and establish a 'syndicalist tyranny' will face the full force of the law."
newengland.101.a:0 "We will be ready"

newengland.102.t:0 "Radical Coalition formalizes!"
newengland.102.d:0 "The so-called Radical Coalition has cemented its political alliance in reaction to both Canadian and syndicalist influence in New England. This occurred after members of the two leading factions of the movement, "The Remnant" and "The Sentinels of the Republic", met and agreed to pool together their formally fairly weak militias. A loose grouping within New England lead by right-wing intellectuals and organizations, the Coalition is unified in viewing the State as the ultimate threat to man and the syndicalists as merely another group of fanatics attempting to use it for their own agenda of abolishing property laws. With the increase in populist movements in recent years, more middle and upper class citizens have listened to this faction of New England politics as both a counter-revolutionary force and a solution to the problem of politics. Albert Jay Nock is leader of the Remnant and the Freemen magazine, and the more radical wing of the Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic, started as a right-wing lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy before going through a series of internal radicalizations. This involved influence from the Remnant and New England Right before turning to a mixture of Social Darwinist sciences and reinterpretations of Egoism to use their arguments against not only wealth redistribution but any attacks on the wealthy. This is something the original Egoists, whose arguments they borrowed, have mixed or even negative feelings about. \n\n With the formalization of the alliance, their supporters in Congress have officially changed their party affiliation to the Radical Coalition, with the Sentinels providing the funding and the Remnant the militia volunteers. Together they declare man's freedoms will not end so long as they are on watch."
newengland.102.a:0 "Extremists!"

newengland.103.t:0 "The Great Strike!"
newengland.103.d:0 "using the semi-legal SPA's machine, Abbott has directed the New England workers to choose today to do a mass strike and have the militias rise at the same time, calling it the "two-pronged strategy"! Red Guards are overtaking South Boston and have some of our dockyards are suffering from mass strikes. We will need to act at once! We must either send our own men to try to overtake the militias which will be bloody but likely end in a victory, request Canadian assistance at the cost of likely becoming more reliant on Canada, something that is sure to anger many New Englanders but might end in a more favorable resolution. However some of our advisors believe to give Canada an opening to occupy our soil would open the gates to other extremist movements and believe we should just stomp it out ourselves."
newengland.103.a:0 "We can handle this!"
newengland.103.b:0 "Request Canada's aid!"
newengland.103.c:0 "This isn't a serious threat!"

newengland.1030.t:0 "The Leftist Takover!"
newengland.1030.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, the leftist strikers have overwhelmed government forces in New England and taken power! However, though the cause of revolution seemed simple enough as a unifying force for the rebels, the question of governance is much more divisive. There are two main camps among the New Englander leftists. One camp is led by Leonard Abbott and wishes to align itself with the CSA, espousing mainstream syndicalist values and believing their unification with the Combined Syndicates to be necessary for their victory in the war. The other camp, led by the populist-socialist Norman Wallace Lermond, espouses Bellamyist ideals along with an emphasis on nature. Lermond does not share Abbott's enthusiasm for the anarchist cause in the Red Belt, instead believing New England should seek its own destiny and perhaps eventually reunify the United States under its own command. These two groups, unified until now, have come close to exchanging blows recently, and it seems only one group will be able to win out in the end..."
newengland.1030.a:0 "Abbot's hardliners take over and rally with the CSA!"
newengland.1030.b:0 "Lermond's moderates take power!"

newengland.1031.t:0 "New England Joins with the CSA!"
newengland.1031.d:0 "Today, Leonard Abbott has announced the unification of New England with the Red Belt. This comes after Abbott's syndicalist takeover and quick realization and assertion that the two regions would have a better chance of fending off foes if they cooperated. As such, Abbott has agreed to join with the CSA, and we will continue this war as a united front!"
newengland.1031.a:0 "For the Revolution!"

#Federalist Party Path#

newengland.104.t:0 "Canada Crushes the Rebellion!"
newengland.104.d:0 "Canadian Troops have stormed South Boston and swiftly ended the rebellion, leaving over 50 dead and the city pacified. The dockyard strikers chose to give up shortly afterwards and go home after a warning was issued by the commanding officers that they had an hour to end their strike. With Canada now enforcing martial law over Boston and our port towns we are pratically left even more completely at their mercy and already they are requesting help from members of the 'Loyalist' Federalist Party in maintaining control."
newengland.104.a:0 "A phyric victory perhaps"

newengland.105.t:0 "Control of New England"
newengland.105.d:0 "New England has come under our direct control! After they requested the Canadian military intervene in a syndicalist strike, the commanding officers in charge of protecting New England wasted no time in putting down the strikers. Now they are left with control of Boston and several port cities, giving us control over their industrial economy. The Federalist Party of New England contains our most hardline supporters and as they are providing our officers with support they are requesting we place them in charge to ensure a more stable New England and see that our losses were not for nothing. However, there are those in parliament who argue that more direct control would be more favorable to our cause and allow us to completely subdue the New English. By appointing a Governor-General, the leader of New England would report directly to us, and we could send directives for governing New England as we see fit. Should we trust these Federalists, take a more direct role, or leave them alone?"
newengland.105.a:0 "Appoint them"
newengland.105.b:0 "A more heavy-handed approach"
newengland.105.c:0 "No, we should not intervene too heavily"

newengland.106.t:0 "The Federalist Party Appointed!"
newengland.106.d:0 "Canada has requested we begin to step down and allow the Federalist Party to take charge, offering us political security and funding in return for accepting the offer. It is clear they are not asking however and as we have virtually no means to oppose them as we gifted them much of our military and economic might. With the Vanderbilt and Astor families already competing for power within the Federalist machine to prepare for Canadian appointments, Radicals are already furious at the idea of English royalists seizing the nation and have stated their intent to declare a revolution, but do not have quite enough resources to do so. Perhaps it would be better to endorse the Radical cause and provide it with our remaining military and political aid to pressure Canada to leave, effectively allowing us to play both sides, although many would see this as a dangerous ploy when Canada offers us security."
newengland.106.a:0 "Allow the Federalists to take charge"
newengland.106.b:0 "Request aid from the Radicals!"

newengland.1060.t:0 "A Governor-General?"
newengland.1060.d:0 "With New England beginning to finally return to some form of stability under King Albert, many have begun to wonder if the King should wield power himself or appoint someone in his stead. After all, the King is hardly even in New England, thus appointing someone to rule in his stead could remove the stress of leadership from his shoulders. This person would answer directly to Albert and serve his interests in the region, while also likely having some American ties. It is said that the main candidates for appointment to New England are Baron Fairhaven and Henry Rogers Broughton, men with ties to both Britain and the wealthy Rogers family, and the wealthy Cornelius Vanderbilt III, Joseph Kennedy is also being considered for the position due to his status as a collaborator and foreign minister. The King is set to inform us of his choice at noon today, and they have chosen..."

newengland.1060.f:0 "None, Albert shall rule alone!"

newengland.1061.t:0 "New Executive Powers"
newengland.1061.d:0 "With the appointment of the Governor-General, it seems the largest problem in his way will be the local governors. These men are accustomed to holding significant power in their respective states, and some of them obviously expected to rule the region in its entirety. James Michael Curley, accustomed to being in charge of Boston and by extension the most powerful state in New England, has been the most vocal critic of this new system, and men like him will only get in our way. As such, we must grant new powers to the Governor-General, but whatever we do, we must tread carefully. Should we grant the Governor-General new powers over the military, increase his legislative powers, or allow him to override any decisions the courts make?"
newengland.1061.a:0 "Give him greater control over the military"
newengland.1061.b:0 "Help him sideline Congress"

newengland.1062.t:0 "The Oath of Loyalty"
newengland.1062.d:0 "Today, hundreds of politicians across New England are swearing oaths of loyalty to our new government as well as the King in Canada. Through these oaths, we can find out who is willing to prove their loyalty, and who still harbors sympathies for traitors. As the sun rises on New England, these words are heard: "I swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King [CAN.GetLeader], King of New England, His Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of the Dominion of New England, and fulfill my duties as an imperial citizen." With this oath complete, we have endeared our most prominent politicians to the Dominionist government, and now their commitment to the imperial cause is recorded for all to see."

newengland.1063.t:0 "Everyday Life in New England"
newengland.1063.d:0 "Now that our political crises have largely abated, life has returned to normal in New England. Our children learn about the British Empire and the Weltkrieg in their history classes, and the newest innovations in Canadian science have made science classes more useful than ever for the rising generation. Our workers enjoy their mornings more than ever, with more than enough maple syrup and tea to go around. The King's men keep order in the factories and stomp out any leftist revolts in their infancy, giving our workers a sense of security they have been missing for a long time. Infrastructure programs and lax borders have led to many reunions among those in New England with old British family ties and their kin in Canada. Our markets swell with products from every corner of the Entente, and our treasury has only grown as a result of our trade with our imperial allies.It is the beginning of a new day in New England!"
newengland.1063.a:0 "Soon we shall be the jewel of the empire!" 

newengland.1064.t:0 "Coronation in Boston"
newengland.1064.d:0 "King [CAN.GetLeader] arrived in Boston today, along with an escort of hundreds of important Canadian and British officials, all to oversee his coronation as king of New England. The region has obviously not had a king in quite some time, and the crowning of [CAN.GetLeader] will be a stark contrast to the Boston Tea Party over a century and a half ago. As this is an unprecedented event in New England, and local officials are unsure of how to conduct a coronation, the Coronation Committee has stepped in to help plan this magnificent event. For his part, King [CAN.GetLeader] did not want a lavish ceremony at first, yet his advisors were able to convince him to engage in one due to the morale victory it would give his people and the symbolic justice of it all. \n\n As the King was anointed, crowned, and enthroned, the empire celebrated the return of New England to its rightful home. New coins and stamps have been minted to further demonstrate the King's ties to New England, and the Governor-General was only one of several dominion leaders present to renew their allegiance to the King. This was also one of the first events of the sort to include media coverage, and people all across New England and the wider empire tuned in on their radios or televisions. As the return procession began with thousands returning to Ottawa and elsewhere, it was clear to all observers that this was a new day in New England."
newengland.1064.a:0 "Long live our noble King!"

newengland.1065.t:0 "Viscount Kennedy?"
newengland.1065.d:0 "Joseph P. Kennedy, a highly influential New England politician, is one of the first men we have considered for a new royal title. Given the contrast between his power and his insecurities about his Irish heritage, he would be a prime candidate to endear to Canada and the royal cause. For his whole life, Kennedy had been discriminated against for his Irish background, with much of high society failing to accept him and even snubbing his family. Now would be his chance to leapfrog these socialites and find his way into imperial high society. As a result, his businesses will surely prosper and his prestige will only continue to grow. However, given his business interests in Hollywood, perhaps he is more interested in American business than he is in Entente business, meaning we would need to put some trust in the man if we are to grant him the title of viscount. Should we do it?"
newengland.1065.a:0 "Yes, make him Viscount Kennedy!"
newengland.1065.b:0 "Let's look at some other candidates..."

newengland.1066.t:0 "Baron Rockefeller?"
newengland.1066.d:0 "Nelson Rockefeller is one of the wealthier men in New England, and as such, his position merits a royal title. Though he was a poor student in school and is still fairly young, the government in Ottawa believes that he would serve the crown well as a baron, due to the influence of his family and his own high discipline, making him a safe choice for such a title. However, we should take care with this appointment: appointing people merely for their wealth could set a precedent and cause the elites we do not like to also demand titles. Since he wishes to personally join the political scene as soon as possible, we could grant him this title as a sort of endorsement, and justify it that way. What should we do?"
newengland.1066.a:0 "Yes, let's jumpstart his career!"
newengland.1066.b:0 "He is not worthy of the title..."

newengland.1067.t:0 "Earl Nahant?"
newengland.1067.d:0 "Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. is quite powerful in New England, particularly Massachusetts, being one of the few Republicans with any power in the region. Now that New England is a dominion, he is worthy of a title. His birth in Nahant, Massachusetts, a small town, hides the fact that he is the head of a family with a long history of positions in government. As such, we believe that he is worthy of the title "Earl of Nahant", which would bring him to our side politically and also demonstrate to our people that long family lines will be rewarded, so long as they are loyal. Giving someone with a reputation and level of fame such as Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. may be just the message we want to send, but similarly to Rockefeller, we may need to be careful of sending the wealthy the wrong message. Should we grant Lodge the title of earl?
newengland.1067.a:0 "Yes, he deserves it!"
newengland.1067.b:0 "This would make Kennedy angry..."

newengland.1068.t:0 "Wiping the Boston Tea Party from History"
newengland.1068.d:0 "For as long as America has existed as a free state, the Boston Tea Party has served as a point of pride for Americans, especially New Englanders. Now that we have reconciled with the British however, this event is distasteful, and some are clamoring for it to be removed from the history books altogether. It the words of one British-American, it was "a shameful display of disobedience to their rightful king". Instead, perhaps we should emphasize the actions taken against Loyalist Americans during the war, such as the property destruction the Patriots inflicted on innocent loyal men and women, rather than the devastation they wrought on the crown and its businesses. We will likely never shake the perceptions of the Revolutionary War from our people, but perhaps we can make the Loyalist cause a more favored one than they are now. Let us proceed!"

However the situation is still unstable and they have yet to even unify behind a candidate for President, of which the well-connected and pro-Federalist Astor and Vanderbilt families seemingly spending every dime and bit of political capital competing for top spot. The Astor's closer ties to Canada's political elite give them greater comfort to the Canadian elite and more direct political ties whereas the Vanderbilt's are favored by more of New England for their wealth being based out of the region and heavier philanthropy, with their new money extravagances often being the talk of the town (for better or worse). /n/The candidates include the more traditionally aristocrat and English officer John Jacob Astor whose birth in America would technically make him qualified to run for President but nonetheless makes him more unpopular to locals, the philanthropist Vincent Astor who is more popular within New England (by Astor standards) but less connected to us and too personally reformist for the tastes of many Canadian conservatives, prominent yachtsman and card player Harold Stirling Vanderbilt who seems acceptable to the New England populace despite being less so to Canadian royals and finally motor car racer William Kissam Vanderbilt, whom is quite popular in the area but only somewhat interesting in governing if not for his family allowing him to use him as a candidate."

Their relatively moderate stance has gained them political seats in local, state and even a handful of national representative positions.

Sirovich gave speeches decrying dissenters for opposing a reform that is not only truer to New England's heritage but will ensure safety. Nonetheless the most controversial parts of the new Constitution, including a provision that would see the both the President and Senators elected for life by electors is sure to endanger only more hatred until it can pass, as would its weakening of the states for Federal power.

Of course, hardline Egoists and 'Radical Anarchists' in the party are unlikely to go with it, but with the wealthy upper core of the Sentinels on our side we would have their wealth resources at our disposal.

newengland.120.d:0 "Since the beginning of the Constitutional Coalition there has been frictures between the Radicals, namely the Remnant and the Sentinels of the Republic. The Remnant favor a constitutional republic with a minimalist state, but is split on the question of whether or not democracy should be a component of it or if it's too dangerous to democracy. The Sentinels are far more radical, favoring the solution of the state in favor of a "Natural Capitalism", and are led by the DuPoint family, whom are being accused of literally buying delegates with Sentinel funds. In between them are the more traditional anarcho-egoists who are split between a Sentinel force they view as corrupting their message but nonetheless are more serious about dissolving the state and supporting the Remnant. It is likely they will decide the dominant faction. However, if a decision cannot be reached, a maverick is present in the form of Lothrop Stoddard and his Nordic League. Stoddard disagrees with both the Remnant and the Sentinels on many issues, especially the anarchist ideals of the Remnant. However, his pre-established fame would make him an easy compromise, and he has admirers in both factions. Who shall prevail?"

newengland.201.d:0 "With New England under Canadian protection, the first order of business remains the establishment of a legitimate government in this time of crisis, and the reaffirmation and recognition of the Constitution of the United States as the primary source of law and authority in the nation. Leaders and statesmen are making their way to Connecticut, hoping to make history with their involvement in the preservation of America. Others, however, see the Convention as more than an opportunity to not reaffirm the Constitution, but a place to make crucial changes to the document to prevent yet another Civil War. These political dissidents have flocked to the immigrant-backed and Quaker-led alliance under Clarence Pickett or Lovecraft’s increasingly militant and outspoken Loyal Coalition. Canadian liberation has given us freedom and isolation from the Second American Civil War. Yet, with the Second Hartford Convention about to begin, the future of New England seems even more uncertain."

newengland.202.t:0 "Lovecraft and the Providence Society"
newengland.202.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, untold thousands rushed to the relative safety, stability, and opportunity of America. As the war languished on, immigrants flooded New England, quickly and unexpectedly changing the face of the northeast. With these diverse, new interests came new problems: particularly, nativist resentment. These problems were only compounded by the economic recession that set in after the Kaiserreich began to isolate the United States of America. This discontent was championed by one of New England’s most famous personalities: the celebrity author, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s meteoric rise to fame in recent years is based on his tales of weird and diabolical fiction, seen by both fans and critics as giving voice to the xenophobia, economic insecurity, and reactionary instincts of New Englanders.\n\nInitially the darling of Boston Brahmins and New England’s Anglo-Saxon majority, Lovecraft’s work spread like wildfire across the country, turning him into an overnight sensation. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, one of Lovecraft's most famous novellas, deals obliquely with the threats of state conspiracy and invasion, as well as miscegenation and its monstrous consequences. Some of his most ardent followers swear that prophetic, astrological portents can be understood through comprehensive study of his work. To many, Lovecraft may just be another insane writer with less than moderate views, to others he is a prophet that can guide New England to safety. But whatever Lovecraft may be, he is still a shy, reclusive writer, unlikely to take any drastic action. The only ones in New England that wish to see him in power are the extreme Anglophiles. They view Lovecraft as a tool to ensure complete loyalty to Canada. For now, Lovecraft and his small circle of writers stick to Providence and continue on with their lives, only accompanied by small groups of fans and loyalists. "

However, in reality people abuse the Devil’s nectar, and use it to commit horrible acts in their drunken rage. As well the productivity of all people decrease as the worker partakes in suds instead of doing their job. So, as Drunkenness ravages New England and the rest of the United States an unexpected force has risen from the dead. Due to the nationwide failure of prohibition, most sane people assumed that the Prohibition Party was dead in the ground; however, is has made a stunning comeback as New England is ravaged by drunkenness. The party now mainly bases itself in New England and is lead by David Leigh Colvin. Colvin believes that all New Englanders must be moral, compassionate, and caring for every man. The party’s main platform is to illegalize the sale and production of Alcohol, as well as prohibiting Pornography, instilling Christian Values into the nation, and helping the American Refugees fleeing from the Civil War.

Citing the progressive precedent set by the Roosevelt-administration and the teachings of Jesus Christ, Pickett has begun drafting a set of crucial amendments for New England’s Constitution. Deemed the “Appeal to Heaven,” the Quaker platform aims to transform New England into a welfare state that can open its arms to the downtrodden across the shattered American continent."

In the pursuit of a possible everlasting peace between brothers, we must emphasize the shared American traditions that bind us together, and what better a tradition to focus on than Thanksgiving? In an attempt to foster national unity in this fractured Union, President Pickett has had his secretary send out invitations to all leaders of the major belligerent factions of the Second American Civil War for a good, old-fashioned, New England-style Thanksgiving.

As dinner neared being ready, a knock came on the door, signalling their most eagerly awaited guest had finally arrived. As Pickett opened the door, he was elated to find none other than William Dudley Pelley of the Silver Legion on his doorstep!\n\n Though the two pious titans of the American politician scene had had little to no interactions beforehand, they had been familiar with each other's work, both politically and parochially. What began as a quiet and awkward dinner soon turned into an exuberant scene as the two thinkers exchanged ideas and notions on all manners of topics, from the common to the esoteric. After hours, long after Pickett’s wife went off to bed, growing tired of the two men’s seemingly unending fascination with each other, Pelley began to reveal some of his far more outlandish theories and talents, including his fabled ability to levitate, which Pickett witnessed with his very own tired and weary eyes! \n\nStaying up straight through night to morning, Pickett and Pelley’s conversations and braindiggind never ceased, but with more pressing and important matters calling them back to work, their meeting would have to come to an end.

The Irish in New England have also begun to take arms, as they believe that the radical Anglophiles will soon drive them out.  These tensions that have been simmering below the surface finally erupted today. When protests erupted in Boston today over the coronation of an Autocratic King. Most New-Englanders have declared Canada and the Windsor’s illegitimate. People have been in an uproar, and violence has been widespread. The largest of these protests have been in Boston, the nation's capital. As the Irish and the England take up arms against each other, Canada desperately tries to bring stability to New England, to no avail. And in the end, Canada may have to take sides in what is rapidly becoming a Civil War. If such a war is to occur within New England, Canada has it’s eye on the most radical Anglophiles, those who will ensure Canada’s rule over New England is secure."

And rallied the Providence Society together with the loyalists, to wage war against the impure traitors to the North. A civil war has errupted, Providence's new Crusade against the impure. This comes as a shock not just to the people of New England, but the world. As Lovecraft’s isolation and paranoia has made it almost impossible for him to achieve any sort of political power. However, something has changed in Lovecraft. Perhaps he knows that he is near death, perhaps his overwhelming hatred of the Irish Catholics drove him. Whatever the case may be, Lovecraft and his allies in the Loyal Coalition march for Boston, the center of the Irish Scourge. There, Lovecraft, and his allies within the Providence Society are expected to make an address, a prospect that terrifies the timid Lovecraft. As the small group of writers and loyalists quickly assume control of the nation, Canada sends their full support to the new Providence Government.

The founder and savior of our modern nation has passed, and the Great Outsider now walks into the afterlife; his soul cut free and untethered from this mortal coil, now liberated to travel the ethereal plain as he sees fit. After a decade-long fight with cancer of the gut, and despite many phases of remission, the plague gnawing away at his innards and very soul has finally taken his life. Our beloved King in Yellow spent his last days corresponding with old friends and editing his final novel -  an epic that would shatter the world itself! Despite being  left unfinished, it was rumoured to have been able to send a healthy man into cardiac arrest - a perfected example of cosmic horror capable of driving away any grasp on sanity. Lovecraft’s body was found in the garden of the state house, lying face first in a puddle of water, and with a note in his hand. The note simply read: ‘For me, it’s Elysia’ - a puzzling final message to all but his closest confidants and friends.\n\n Now, with their Cosmic Demigod and Master of the Pen lying cold in the dark earth, a power struggle has emerged between old friends of HPL now turned into vicious and ambitious enemies, each battling for their right to lead our nation as they seek to commune with the Elder Gods and do right by their old master’s vision. Among the most prominent and most widely popular Lovecraft’s myriad of possible successors are Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth and Henry S. Whitehead. Each offers their own interpretation of Lovecraft's ideology and mythos, and each has a different vision for our ethereal cosmic paradise HPL started building here for our people. However, there can only be one to rule them all, and one must rise above all others to stand where He stood and lead the nation in Lovecraft’s footsteps."

Many of Lovecraft's followers, carrying flags in the likeness of the national flag, silently paid homage to Providence, his richly and esoterically adorned tomb standing before them. Lovecraft's black cat could also be seen climbing onto the grave and placing its paw on the center as if to pay homage to its beloved deceased master.  Also present were members of the various Lovecraftian cults who gave quasi-religious speeches quoting Lovecraft's works as one would quote verses from the Bible. \n\n After the ceremony, Lovecraft was laid to rest in his hometown of Providence, Long Island, in a tomb worthy of him, decorated with an artistic representation of Cthulhuc as the late writer imagined.

When the sheet of paper was circulated today at the meeting of the ministers, they expressed different opinions, some thinking that these last wishes were only due to Lovecraft's physical and mental illness, for others these words constitute Lovecraft's last wishes and as successor to his thought, it is our duty to follow all his words.\n\n We must now choose what to do..."

With Lovecraft already being one of the most popular authors in the Anglo world, him reaching worldwide popularity will bring easy profit to the state, and with Derleth attaching some of his own literary works to the initiative, he stands to make a pretty penny in personal profits himself. Regardless, the funds will go to bettering the state and the notoriety will only serve to boost our international acclaim, legitimacy, and position.

While there, he traveled the Haitian countryside and every inch of their villages and cities in search of fascinating facets of their native mythologies and spiritual ideas to incorporate into his own writings. Learning about the Loa of the Vodou faith and on stories of Witch Doctors and Oungans, the stories that truly piqued Derleth’s interest were on local tales of the undead, and that is what has made him return here now. \n\nIn Haitian tradition, there are beings known as the Zombi. Bokor - or Haitian dark priests that are in opposition to the Oungans - supposedly create these undead Zombies by taking the ‘ti bon ange,’ or half of Vodou’s idea of a dual soul that controls free will, and placing it in a bottle, allowing the Bokor to control the victim after death, for the ti bon ange can then manipulate the ‘gros bon ange’ - the second half of the dual-soul that controls the body. The beings created are mindless husks, completely enslaved to the will of their master, being mindless and feeling no pain or general emotion. They are created, then fed a poison created from the local wildlife that makes them appear dead, so that their loved ones bury them and move on. The Bokor then exhumes these ensnared slaves for use as personal servants while the family believes them to be dead, leading to the impression that outsiders of Vodou hold that Zombies are truly the living dead. \n\nThe idea of this practice and the wider Vodou faith have deeply interested Derleth, who now has returned to walk Port-au-Prince and wider Haiti in search of the spark of inspiration once again. Regardless of what he finds, Derleth is sure to enjoy himself among the palm trees and tropical breeze of this cultured island paradise."

All schools in the state would be nationalized, taken under control of the central government and given a state-endorsed curriculum to teach. In addition to normal subjects, the arts and literature will be pushed on every child as pillars of the educational system. Non-Euclidean geometry will also be taught, as well as astronomy, archeology, anthropology, and theology - all through a Lovecraftian lens. Occultism and ‘Lovecraftian Science’ will also become new subjects, exposing our children to the genius of Providence at a young age, and Lovecraft’s entire body of literary works will be required reading, as well as the works of his largest influences like Edgar Allen Poe, Jules Verne, H.G Wells, and others. Furthermore, the ‘Lovecraftian’ language - the language seen in Lovecraft’s works like the Call of Cthulhu - is to be taught as a secondary tongue to all students to better unite our people and separate us from the outside world and our American past.

Promoting futurist ideals and dreaming of seeing some of these fantastical technologies and advancements often written about actually seeing the light of day, Long has begun adapting motifs and aesthetics from these works into the state while promoting his own writings of the genre as well.

Taking his deep Christian convictions and fusing it with these ideas, the Eldritch Apostle has created a new syncretic Church for the world to now witness. Elevating the late Howard Philip Lovecraft as the physical manifestation of God, or as God himself, while raising the various elder beings of the wider Lovecraftian Mythos into lower positions within the new pantheon, Whitehead has created an odd fusion of Protestant Chritianity and Lovecraftian occultism, incorporating aesthetics, practices, and ceremonies from both in a weird fusion of holy horror and blessed occultism. Revering the Necronomicon as equal to the Bible and revering both Whitehead’s and Lovecraft’s individual bodies of literary works as holy texts, this new Church of Providence has risen from the old cults that once snuck through the shadows of our state. Brought to light and now legitimized, the Eldritch Apostle has created a new faith that shall bring salvation through fear - fear in God and fear of the unknowable, unfathomable, endless expanse of the cosmos, and what might lurk inside - or outside - this dark, soul-crushing reality."

Incorporating elements from the Lovecraftian Mythos so that the two interpretations of faith align, Whitehead’s has dubbed this new divine text as the ‘Howard Phillips Lovecraft Bible of God and Providence.’ Within this text, a fused retelling of creation and history is shown, offering the true past, present, and future of the human race and the cosmos around us, shedding light on how tiny and insignificant we truly are both in the face of the unknown and in the face of God and the Elder Gods. With voices in his head telling him that Lovecraft is both God himself and just His greatest Prophet, even Whitehead himself is torn over the final word of the faith, leaving an open-ended question in the faith that is up to interpretation by the masses.

This seemingly insane avenue of thought is only Whitehead’s latest foray into what he has begun to call ‘Lovecraftian Science’ - a school of thought seen as pseudoscience to many that attempts to bring to reality the many fantastical and horrific things the Lovecraftian Mythos has recorded in literature. From the creation of living fishmen to his attempts at bottling a soul, Whitehead has tried it all in an attempt to further the advancement of the state, but has sadly failed at every turn. Despite managing to make some genetic mutants and freaks of nature through embryo manipulation and surgery, these poor creatures died shortly after creation before they could even be named, and nothing useful or moral has been produced in these endeavors, but yet Whitehead persists. In this latest attempt, he has sewn together freshly dead corpses of execution victims, jolting it with electricity over and over again in a vain attempt to jumpstart life.

The manifesto has been titled ‘An Examination of the Lovecraftian Ideology as Formulated by Howard Philips Lovecraft and as Organized by Frank Belknap Long,’ and seeks to thoroughly explain what our state and our ideology are all about. Frequently just nicknamed the ‘New Necronomicon’ or the ‘National Grimoire,’ this dense document outlines the goals, preferred policies, social stances, racial views, religious ideas, and general ideology of Lovecraftism in exhaustive detail. \n\nIn short, it summarizes Lovecraftian thought as a populist, technocratic, nationalist, anglophilic, occultist movement that is vaguely ‘Right-wing’ while simultaneously pulling from Leftist thought and millenarian in nature, calling for national rebirth and complete society reorganization. It is centered around the Cult of Providence - a occultist cult of personality built around the late Howard Philips Lovecraft that raises him as a God-life figure - and is Spartan in nature, calling for the proliferation and distintification of the New England culture while preaching White Anglo-Saxon Protestant supremacy. Economically, it functions as a mixed economy, pulling from both Corporatist and Capitalist notions while shaming the free, untamed market and overt Socialism, though it is deeply populist and features planned economics. Featuring a love for faux American and pure Anglo aristocracy and upholding the military as one the key arms of the state, it is elitist and martially minded while being largely isolationist and featuring many policies that would be considered pro-working class. Under a Lovecraftist system, the arts - especially literature - are elevated as the pinnacles of society, and much attention and funding is given to artistic pursuits. Finally, on the spiritual front, it supports and seeks to proliferate both Protestant Christianity and the Lovecraftian occultist mythos in a syncretic mix designed to bring salvation and morality to the masses through a fear in God and the unknown, raising the Elder Gods and Lovecraft to the heights of the Christian Pantheon as equal and completely unknowable beings. \n\nHowever, the ideology has changed a lot since Lovecraft’s first rise to power, and now much has been altered and tweaked by his rightful successor Master Long in order to fit his own ambitions, ideas, and hopes for the state. Overall, the document reveals that Lovecraftism is an ideology of contradictions, leaving many with more questions than answers. Regardless, this form-fit ideology perfectly encapsulates what makes Lovecraft’s homeland unique, and what makes Master Long such a visionary.

The small black cat stuck with the young Howard, calling the little Nigger-Man ‘one of the most fascinating and understanding creatures I’ve ever seen.’ However, on one tragic day in 1904, when the young Lovecraft was just 14 years old, Nigger-Man went missing, never to be seen again. \n\nAll his life, Lovecraft fawned over the loss of his favorite feline friend, often reminiscing over the sounds he used to make, with Lovecraft being cited as saying ‘he used to talk in a genuine language of varied intonations—a special tone for every different meaning. There was even a special ''prrr'p'' for the smell of roast chestnuts, on which he dotes. He used to play ball with me—kicking a large rubber sphere back at me from half across the room with all four feet as he lay on the floor. And on summer evenings in the twilight he would prove his kinship to the elfin things of shadow by racing across the lawn on nameless errands, darting into the blackness of the shrubbery now & then, & occasionally leaping at me from ambush & then bounding away again into invisibility before I could catch him.’ \n\nFor years this hole in his heart nagged at him, until the day he began formulating his rise to power. Finally in charge of his own destiny as well as the fate of the nation, and finally over his crippling fears and anxieties, Howard Philips Lovecraft went to the finest pet store in New England and adopted a small black kitten to replace the companion he lost all those years ago. Calling him ‘Nigger-Man Jr.,’ the small black cat stayed by Lovecraft’s side throughout his rise to power and well into his transformation into Providence. In his sorrow as he began to deteriorate in his last days, Lovecraft stayed close to his new Nigger-Man fiercely, and the small black cat loyally stood by him until the final end. \n\nWith the passing of Providence, Nigger-Man Jr. is without master and without home, though a decent portion of Lovecraft’s own final will was left in his name.

An age-old friend to our beloved Providence and one of our regime’s most beloved figures, Clark Ashton Smith has been nicknamed the ‘Prince in Yellow’ by many due to his deep bond with our late national father. Smith was an accomplished author in his own right, contributing deeply to the Lovecraftian mythos and being one of the biggest writers of the now-praised Weird Tales along with Lovecraft and their Texan friend and contemporary Robert E. Howard. Smith grew close to Lovecraft during their time writing for the magazine together, and the two worked together, wrote together, and conversed together more than Lovecraft did with possibly anyone else. All throughout Lovecraft’s rise and the creation of our fantastical nation, Smith proved to be a loyal and capable ally to the now-late Lovecraft, and since then he has come to aid our state. \n\nHowever, despite possibly being Lovecraft’s greatest friend in life, Smith did not put his name forward to become Lovecraft’s successor, in spite of Lovecraft’s own private personal wishes declaring that Smith be his ‘heir’ - a fact kept secret by Smith at all costs. The main reason for Smith’s hesitance towards rule is his crippling agoraphobia - or fear of public environments and crowds - which keeps him largely confined to his cottage with his wife and children, quietly aiding the state from the privacy of his own home aside from the occasional trips he must on business or out of other necessities. Instead, Smith is the Silent Prince of [tag.getname], aiding [tag.getleader] from the safety of the shadows and crusading to build a true Lovecraftian paradise. Without his aid, we would surely fail, for he keeps both Lovecraft’s successor and the administration around him honest and true to the original vision of Providence!"

Once Archdeacon of the territory before joining Lovecraft’s circle, Whitehead fell in love with the archipelago, incorporating their local culture, traditions, and mythos into his writings and falling in love with the native occultist traditions. Never forgetting the place these islands held in his heart, Whitehead deemed them to be the perfect place to set up our first Lovecraftian church outside our national borders. Arriving in St. Croix, Whitehead and the missionaries he brought along with him got to work establishing a Lovecraftian-Christian Church on the island to spread the word of God and Providence. With this new chapel in place, the missionaries shall stay on the island as the full-time caretakers and itinerants of this new branch of our church while Whitehead will return to us to resume his duties as the Eldritch Apostle. As this foreign congregation grows, we take our first steps into making our faith an internationally recognized and respected faith."

As the monstrosity first opened it milky eyes, it began wailing in pain and screaming in agony, tearing through the restraints that bound it to the operating table with rippling grey muscle and rotting sinew before going on a rampage around the Eldritch Apostle’s sanctum. Calling for the guards of Delta Green to come save him and put the beast down, Whitehead first thought on this possible miracle, for he had truly brought this beast to life, and though it clearly had no business or desire to be alive, the strength and power it showcased was nothing short of magnificent. As the guards entered the room and took aim at the beast, Whitehead had to make a choice... "

Under orders from [tag.getleader] and in accordance with the ideology of Providence, we have moved to dismantle the Irish’s poor excuse for a government and state apparatus, and have begun to reorganize the island as a sort of reservation. Modeled on the Yankee system used to control and corral the American Indians during the days of Manifest Destiny, nearly the entire island of Ireland shall become the formal dumping ground for undesirables. The Northern portion of the isle centered around Ulter shall remain an Anglo stronghold, with a great wall of concrete and steel rising to separate this region from the rest of the vile island. A purification campaign will be performed, exiling all Irish and other unfavorables and criminals from across the growing empire to live on this accursed little rock. From here, with their close proximity to the heartland of the Anglo race, we will be able to keep a close eye on these scoundrels as we build our new imperium.

In a fury of high anticipation and excitement, the group plunged in the murky abyss and slowly made their descent. However, after hours of sluggishly sinking into the dark ocean, the intrepid explorers had their wonder and optimism turn sour, for all they could see was an endless darkness. Rising to the surface only to dive again the next day, this process repeated for weeks all across the area of Nemo Point, but not a single sign of R'lyeh’s location or even existence was uncovered. \n\nWith their hope turning to frustration, traitorous thoughts began to fill their head that Providence was wrong, or even worse - lied to his adoring masses. Quickly though, they came to their senses as the ideas and conditioning of Lovecraftism flowed into their thoughts, and the group came to the conclusion they simply could not go deep enough, or maybe they were looking in the wrong spot. Perhaps even, the city may be invisible, preventing our mortal eyes from witnessing its non-Euclidean splendor. Whatever the case may be, the expedition did not find Cthulhu or R’lyeh, and set sail for home both empty handed and heartbroken, while also full of questions to ask [tag.getleader] on their return."

Born Sonia Shafirkin Haft in Ukraine in 1883, her Jewish family left the Russian Empire after the death of Sonia’s father, with her mother going to America while leaving Sonia and her brother in England for safety. Upon becoming a teenager, Sonia followed her mother to America, where she would grow up and eventually marry a Russian immigrant 10 years her senior, fathering his child until the baby passed away at age 3. Despite this tragedy, her first husband Samuel Morris would sire her another child in the form of a daughter in 1903 - Lovecraft’s beloved step-daughter Florence Carol - before finally killing himself in 1916 after a long history of mental illness. Sonia became a devoted single mother, independently supporting both her and her daughter on her own salary while working as a milliner and dabbling in journalism and literature. \n\nIt was while traveling as an amateur journalist when she first met Providence, in 1921 in Boston. Instantly she gravitated towards Lovecraft’s genius and spirit, and the two became fast friends and lovers. Just three years after meeting, in 1924, they married, and since then she and her daughter have stuck by Lovecraft’s side as he rose to become the face of the pulp movement, one of the biggest author’s in America, and eventually the national father of our new state, with both Sonia and Florence Carol all the while rising as two accomplished authors in their own right. \n\nNow, with Lovecraft’s death and with the rise of his successor [tag.getleader], the ‘Queen in Yellow’ as she was once known is now a grieving widow, and their daughter Florence Carol - the Princess of Providence - once again has lost a father. However, just because Providence has passed that does not mean we shall simply forget these great figures of our state. Sonia shall be raised to be the matriarch of our state, interpreting the will of Lovecraft from beyond the grave as the arbitrator of his final wishes, while her daughter, who Lovecraft lovingly raised has his own, shall be forever taken care of by the state. Both of their own writings will come to carry on the Lovecraftian Mythos in Providence’s image, and with their approval of and support to [tag.getleader]’s regime, the legitimacy of our new national guide shall be solidified."

After talking with Lovecraft, Mulder has suggested the creation of an “X-Brigade”, to deal with the existence of alien life forms.

This discovery has shaken the internal structure of the intelligence community to its core, and a major rift has formed between X-Brigade and their superiors at Delta Green. Delta Green remains fanatics to Lovecraft’s ambitions to defend civilization at all costs, to the point of destroying any and all vestiges of the paranormal or extraterrestrial. Yet who can deny the thrilling implications, the scientific discovery, and the military applications if we were to further study and cooperate with these visitors from the stars? To that end, a group of twelve high ranking officials from all corners of the government have convened to create Majestic-12, a cabal dedicated to the purpose of investigating and recovering alien spacecraft. The majority of X-Brigade, for their part, have secretly broken  with Delta Green and have become by every meaningful metric an extension of Majestic-12."

The cultists in the Esoteric Order of Dagon would let these forces run roughshod over New England, and use their occult studies to bring yet more horrors into our world.\n\n Providence, growing increasingly aloof and out-of-touch with the status of his own officials, has failed to notice this looming threat as large swaths of his government have sworn allegiance to one of the three factions battling for the soul of New England. Where each organization once worked behind the scenes to undermine the other, tensions have now broken out into open acts of violence against each other with agents on all sides quietly targeting their rivals and attempting to purge them from various institutions across the country. Sooner or later, however, a clear victor will emerge as the true power behind Providence."

newengland.257.d:0 "When Providence originally began the process of rewriting his novella “Shadow Over Innsmouth” into a more substantial tome, it was merely to satisfy the demand of his followers to expand on its themes and motifs to better immerse the reader in Lovecraft’s world building and philosophy following his break-out success. With his rise to prominence and political dominance however, The Shadow Over Innsmouth has undergone a beautiful and terrifying transformation not unlike that of the Deep Ones of the titular Innsmouth itself. Consisting of two parts, the first half of the book is written from the perspective of the narrator and essentially consists of various curated poems, letters, and speeches previously written by Providence. Several passages are addressed directly to the reader on the nature of New England heritage and narrator’s personal philosophy, who is clearly a stand-in for Providence himself. It is generally understood that this first section exists purely to equip the reader with essential knowledge and build their mental fortitude before the second half.\n\n The story then rapidly unravels into an epic tale and deep dive into the very heart of Lovecraft’s mythos. It is an autobiography, a fabricated story, a description of godhood, equal parts truth and lie, a how-to guide for apotheosis, a profane poem, a holy scripture, an apology for Lovecraft’s actions, a profane gesture to those who'd question his or New England’s legitimacy, and an explanation of how a meek and patient man could rise to such greatness. It is at once a terrifying look into the mind of Providence, a guide on how to become like Him, and an intensely disturbing and immersive story that would take a lifetime to process fully.\n\nWhile weaker minds have been driven to madness by Providence’s magnum opus, those capable of finishing his work without losing themselves emerge fundamentally changed.

Mackenzie King is a well-known believer in the spiritual and the unknown and has taken a particular liking to Lovecraft’s spiritualism and works. And in private, the conversation shifted from the political, to the paranormal and spiritual. Lovecraft and King talked at great lengths about spirits, ghosts and other paranormal occurrences. Rumor even had it that King and Lovecraft held a Seance to communicate with the spirit of the late King George V to ask him for guidance on reclaiming the home isles.

However, the days where Lovecraft is a puppet of Elites is over. \n\n The Loyal Coalition, an organization that Lovecraft used to belong too has wielded the majority of power in New England and have ruled alongside Lovecraft ever since the Providence Society took power. Like Lovecraft, their popularity cam from the hatred of outsiders, mostly Irish Catholics. But, instead of the Loyal Coalition being propped up by proud, pure WASPS, they were propped up by the Astors and Vanderbilts. Elites that will stop at nothing for a quick buck, and that included stepping on this Nation’s Loyal Citizens. \n\n They fully expected that Lovecraft would never take action against them, that he would remain timid and stay in place. Did they know how he hated them, maybe; but Lovecraft was of no concern to them. He would never challenge their power. \n\n That is what they thought, and they thought wrong. \n\n Despite Lovecraft’s Agoraphobia, Paranoia and fear; being in practical charge of a large State has changed him. He was no puppet, and the time to finally get rid of the Elites was here. The big Businessmen who have ruined New England for so long would do so no longer. \n\n The Purge began at 11:00, when Loyal Divisions of the Providence Guard fanned into the streets of Boston, dragging so called “Enemies of Purity” from their homes and offices, and some into Delta Green Black Sites. There, anything awaits them; and none of it can possibly be good. \n\n Even though some tried to resist, Lovecraft’s grip on the nation had become too strong. The Populace, the Military and the Bureaucracy were all loyal to him and him alone, something that the Elites weren’t counting on.\n\n By the end of the night, names were carefully crossed of lists as one by one, Lovecraft’s Enemies were Killed, Arrested or somehow, were condemned to a fate even worse."

Inspired by our new Canadian overlords and the oft-repeated myth of a monarchist Washington, the monarchists seek to create a truly American monarchy, complete with its own distinct royal line. Though they draw inspiration from the great general Washington and the British exiles in the True North, they seek to firmly establish New England sovereignty with the creation of a new dynasty to rule Yankeeland, entirely separate from the Canucks, as they feel bowing to an English monarch would be a betrayal of Revolutionary-era ideals.

The great and affluent families of New England, such as the Kennedys, Astors, or Vanderbilts all have begun to feel the pull of this fanciful ideology. Drawing Hoping to become the new aristocracy of this new potential New Englander kingdom, these rich families of monopoly barons, political titans, and esteemed businessmen all have begun to fancy and support the idea of a Kingdom on American soil; an idea once thought to be antithetical to the American Dream and our founding principles. Despite the apparent contradictions to the land’s founding ideals, these titans of industry have started to demand the allocation of Royal Titles to themselves and their families as they seek to officially become true nobility over their fellow New Englanders. Even worse, they have stated that if the titles aren’t granted, they would begin to support “alternate channels” to gain legitimacy and influence. We could just grant them the titles, as currently they hold little meaning in our republic, or run the risk by not granting them the titles, possibly driving them into the arms of the various seperatist groups in our nation.

In the Vanderbilt family, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, the widow of the late Reginald Vanderbilt, is still young, and could easily remarry, though to whom it is unclear. Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, the son of the elder Alfred Vanderbilt who died on the Titanic, seems more interested in horse racing than he is in women, but he has a number of suitors in Europe who could use an influx of wealth into their once wealthy families. The Kennedy family, looking to replicate the success they enjoyed with their son Robert, has looked to secure powerful matches for their other sons as well, though the reputation of the sons as womanizers has not helped in this department. As a whole, the allure of American wealth has caused many who would otherwise turn their nose at the idea of marrying into such families to reconsider.

Despite this, we will continue to carry on the torch of peace even while we fight on the field of battle, regardless of if that torch is damped by the blood of those who cannot see the light."

newengland.281.t:0 "Quäkerspeisung" 
newengland.281.d:0 "Quäkerspeisungs, or Quaker feedings, are food drives run and funded entirely by Quaker communities, primarily in the United States and England, that provide humanitarian aid and relief to disparate groups across the globe. Earning international recognition for their heroic acts of selflessness displayed in the Weltkrieg by smuggling food and medicine to refugees PoW’s and war-ravaged civilians, these food drives have grown into a valuable diplomatic tool. With our Quaker roots holding strong, and many of these drives already being run by the state and our peoples, it would be smart to capitalize on these organizations. To this end, President Pickett has decided to fully sponsor these Quäkerspeisung programs, while also creating a state-sponsored drive which shall serve as a powerful diplomatic lure. With the established prestige our brave humanitarians have already built up, we shall be able to sway the likes of the Kaiserreich and the Entente exiles in order to foster better relations with the wider world." 
newengland.281.a:0 "Pickett Drives shall help us win their hearts and their aid."

newengland.282.d:0 "America is and always has been a land of immigrants and runaways; our very foundations first taking root in the virgin soil the original settlers tilled in their first planting seasons here in this New World. Since the first white-capped ship made landfall on these shores, we have been a people of varied cultures and backgrounds. With the world growing ever darker and the dreadful spectre of war once again rearing its ugly head abroad, our new Quaker state has been given a chance to reaffirm these old traditions. Many in our administration call for President Pickett to fling open the gates, as it were, letting the huddled masses of refugees and asylum-seekers that have nowhere else to go to pour into our nation. It is in our creed, our way of life, to never let another soul perish or face harm if we ourselves can do something to abate this suffering, and as such it would be paramount to sin if we did not open our doors to these people. New England shall become a beacon for all the world to see; a new colossus rising in the American northeast poised to shelter and protect all those who have strayed from God’s light."

newengland.283.t:0 "The Summit of the Religious Society of Friends"
newengland.283.d:0 "Meeting today in the hallowed John Bowne House in Flushing, Queens is the long-awaited Quaker-run summit on international religious cooperation. Organized by esteemed Quaker author Rufus Jones and President Clarence Pickett, among other notable Friends, this summit serves as the latest brainchild of the Quaker regime in its attempts to build up its international standing. Reaching out to heads of faith across the world, Pickett and Rufus hoped to welcome fellow pious souls from around the globe, fostering closer bonds while exposing our administration to other like-minded regimes worldwide. Though many invitations have gone unanswered, the turnout has still been favorable, with religious titans like Father Divine and William Dudley Pelley making appearances. However, most striking of all was Rufus Jones’ own honored guest, the esteemed Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Serving as long-term penpals and occasionally hosting each other's company, these two theologians share a close bond and fierce friendship. Though the trip was long and difficult, the Mahatma felt it was his duty to honor the invitation of his old friend, and his arrival has made the summit one to remember. As the delegates and zealots all convened to meet and mingle, Pickett and Rufus looked on with gleaming eyes, reveling in their success as they watched their Quaker state gain legitimacy and new allies before their own eyes."

newengland.284.d:0 "After long and arduous years of fighting, we have finally secured the United States firmly within our grasp, much to the astonishment and awe of not only our opponents, but also the world – not only had the victor been perhaps the weakest of all the factions of the Second Civil War, but now America was now under the rule of a monarchy. The very notion that a king would emerge as the new leader of America is simply blasphemous to a sizeable proportion of our population, even after our consolidation of power. However, after the countless number of dead and dozens of cities in ruin, no one is truly willing to oppose us.\n\nOf course, we are not blind to this; many members of the government had once been ardent republicans themselves, including the king, and sentiments of the old United States still lurks in their minds. Therefore, while we may not demolish the new establishment that we have worked so hard to build, we could perhaps compromise. Multiple barons and members of the new American nobility have begun to argue for the implementation of a new system of governance – an elective monarchy. The idea has exploded in popularity amongst the common people also, who see it as a compromise between the democratic values of the old era, and the strong, successful power of the new era. Now, it is up to [NEE.GetLeader] to see if this proposition, once seemingly unimaginable for America, will be accepted."

One major aspect of these efforts is the ‘reestablishment’ of the Electoral College, with considerable differences. This new body of the government is far smaller, only consisting of the most influential barons, nobles, and businessmen across the nation, some of which handpicked by our current monarch – most of whom representing themselves rather than the common people. Despite this, people across the nation anticipated the Electoral College’s decision.\n\nAfter heavy debating, four main candidates for the throne of America would stand out. These include the popular Patrick Kennedy Sr., the deep-rooted Astor family with John Jacob Astor, Hamilton Fish III, and William Henry Vanderbilt III of the prominent Vanderbilt family. Who shall become the new King of America?"

With a strong proclamation from the king, it was officially opened with much of the American populace excited once more to see who would come out on top. Of course, there are now new faces vying for the throne and it is up to the Electoral College to select the next King of America. Some of the more prominent candidates include the promising Fred Trump, and Prescott Bush, who is quite popular amongst the common folk.

Soon enough, America will only remember the time of Kings.  Of course, there are now new faces vying for the throne and it is up to the Electoral College to select the next King of America.

newengland.130.d:0 "With the spread and victory of the Sentinels, the du Pont and Pitcairn families and their allies who are the main movers of the organization on the largest level have taken an eye towards the businesses of the New England families whom aligned themselves with 'Federalism' in an attempt the dominate the economic sphere. With the tables turn, a debate has broken out within the organization, with the Pitcairn's wanting to demand a 'fee' from them for their disloyalty to liberty and the du Pont faction preferring to utilize our militias at once to push them out of the region and seize their territory and businesses to ensure they do not get a second chance to destroy us."
newengland.130.a:0 "Push them out"

newengland.131.t:0 "Worker's Strike!"
newengland.131.d:0 "Worker's in one of the du Pont's industrial chemistry factories have begun to strike following a string of deaths they blame on 'unsafe working conditions'. This is utterly unbelievable as they had freely sold their labor under contract and are now attempting to extort a business they could leave following the end of their contract or, following egoist thought, if they were strong enough to resist it. This socialism needs to be stomped out at once."

newengland.132.t:0 "Fate of Jewish Business"
newengland.132.d:0 "It is no secret that many in the Sentinels, especially du Pont and Alexander Lincoln hold strongly anti-Semitic views, associating Jews with socialist subversion, racial inferiority and hostility to Anglo-Saxons. However, not all Sentinels are eager to back these views, with some merely being practical businessmen who would rather cut a deal with Jewish-owned businesses and one of the more intellectual wings of the Sentinels, the Egoists, not being enthusiastic about such plans. As such while seizing these businesses would be welcome to the most militant Sentinels it would see some slight pushback."

newengland.133.d:0 "While our combination of dissolving the state with the expansion of the Sentinels and its military has seen the end of many former political entities with the dominance of either towns, business, individuals or us, Boston remains an issue under James Michael Curley's political machine. Promising the population protection from instability the machine continues to exist with its own police force, promising a continuation of democracy on their own level. We could allow this but having one of the largest trade hubs under their control, even if they do not stand in our way and allow us to do business there, would be less than ideal."

newengland.134.t:0 "Battle with Vermont"
newengland.134.d:0 "The state of Vermont under the leadership of George Aiken has refused to dismantle its government and allow the Sentinel form of government to take charge.

newengland.135.t:0 "Survival of the Fittest"
newengland.135.d:0 "Among the top Sentinels most fervent beliefs is in Social Darwinism, believing that a philosophy of survival of the fittest creates a stronger people. However, some of the businesses we have been taking have been pushing back with firearms of their own, and to take the lands of homeowners and force them to pay rent to us would be even more difficult even if we have the largest show of force at the moment. As such, many would have us slow our expansionism to focus on consolidating our men while we deal with these men through contract instead of force."

The hardline Nockian and Mencken wing of the party viewed democracy as a threat to liberty for the populace would simply vote for hucksters to take away liberty on the back of false promises or redistribution. The other faction of the Remnant which McCormick leans towards simply expanding the Bill of Rights to make income redistribution and populist economics nearly impossible to implement and just have the Remnant become a political party that defends the ideals of the Radicals in democratic election."

newengland.150.d:0 "Prior to the civil war, Tammany Hall was at the core of the Democratic Party in New York. Viewed by syndicalists as a symbol of bourgeoisie exploitation and corruption, it was torched when the CSA seized the city in the opening days of the war, and would have been completely destroyed had local leaders not redirected the required resources to more pressing matters. Now with New York City in our hands, we must begin to reestablish symbols of liberalism in the area. Local construction magnates have drafted plans to repair the hall, and are simply awaiting government approval."

newengland.160.d:0 "As apart of our investigation of the political machines in our region, it seems Democratic party leader James Michael Curley is now finally under investigation for corruption, specifically spreading and accepting bribes.

newengland.161.d:0 "New England Mob Boss Philip Buccola has been arrested for smuggling, tax evasion, murder and a host of other crimes.

###Stoddard###
newengland.162.t:0 "New Immigration Laws"
newengland.162.d:0 "When Professor S. M. Terman conducted a New York study regarding the intelligence of children from different racial origins, his findings were astounding. He found that Northern European immigrants or descendants had I.Q.'s that were, on average, 20 points higher than those of the Southern European subjects! This is an astounding difference, and Terman also concluded that superior intelligence is five times as common among those of superior social status. So, having established that there is a difference, we now must look at immigration levels. Southern and Eastern Europeans have higher birth rates than those in Northern and Western Europe, and even worse, they are coming to our shores in much larger numbers. If we wish to maintain our current I.Q. levels or even improve them, we cannot continue to allow such immigration. As such, we have decided to outright ban immigration from such nations, as well as a few Asian nations that immigrants commonly come from. However, we are now faced with a harder decision. Should we apply these standards to impure populations in the warring regions of America to our south?"
newengland.162.a:0 "Yes, apply it across the board"
newengland.162.b:0 "No, they are purer and we need the manpower"

newengland.163.t:0 "Categorize the Races"
newengland.163.d:0 "All in Stoddard's administration agree that the work of categorizing the races is important, and yet, few can agree on what the categories should be. Lothrop Stoddard personally  takes his influence from William Ripley's work and advocates the existence of five major racial groups: White, Yellow, Brown, Black, and Red. Within the White group, there are several subcategories, including Nordics, Alpines, and Mediterraneans. Madison Grant largely agrees with these assertions, though he places more value on the Mediterranean race than Stoddard does. A different theorist, Carleton S. Coon, believes in the existence of different categories, with a Caucasoid race in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Western India. He also believes in a division of Sub-Saharan African between Congoid and Capoid races, while East Asia and the Americas are under the Mongoloid race and Australasia and Central India are in the Australoid race. The ideas of Stoddard and Coons are the main theories in the academic community now, but which should we choose? Whatever we choose, it will help us begin to implement Stoddard's vision in New England. However, we may have to put some parts of our society on hold while we conduct the survey."

newengland.164.t:0 "Categoriziation Finished!"

newengland.165.t:0 "Our Friends in the South"
newengland.165.d:0 "It is time for us to decide how we will help our friends in the Klan. Lothrop Stoddard himself is a member of the Klan, and he has found himself sympathizing with their cause in the Second American Civil War. There are several different ways in which we could grant aid to the Constitutional American Republic. We could send a few thousand volunteers and a decent amount of equipment to bolster them, if that is what we believe would benefit them the most. On the other hand, we could mostly send them equipment with just a few hundred volunteers to go along with the shipment, and this would assist in their war effort if we believe they are low on supplies. We could also pick a middle ground between these two options. What should we do?"
newengland.165.a:0 "A middle ground option."
newengland.165.b:0 "They need more men!"
newengland.165.c:0 "They need more equipment!"

newengland.166.t:0 "Degenerate Segregation"
newengland.166.d:0 "The sun has risen on an important day in New England. Today, Lothrop Stoddard has ordered the military and private security forces to begin rounding up the disabled, the insane, and the degenerates in our society and send them away from the rest of the population. Only Stoddard and his close advisors know the details of this separation, but they will not be killed or harmed in any serious way and will be allowed to continue their lives in their new settlements. It will be similar to segregation in the South, though it will include those of lower value even if they are White. This change is for the better; we must ensure there is not contamination in the gene pool if we are to see Stoddard's vision to completion. To be absolutely sure that these elements do not escape and continue to reproduce with the rest of the population, there are whispers that the most inferior groups will be sterilized, so that eventually, only our superior men and women will remain. The higher grades of unsoundness would not be sterilized, but kept separate nonetheless, and through education, we will ensure that our population is enlightened and fully in support of this task."
newengland.166.a:0 "Let us nurture a racial conscience in our society!"

newengland.167.t:0 "Join the American Sphere?"
newengland.167.d:0 "With the Civil War over and the Constitutional American Republic victorious, we are now faced with a choice. Lothrop Stoddard is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he has many friendly feelings towards the Nationalist cause, feelings that are returned in full. Thousands of our people have filled the streets, clamoring for us to proclaim allegiance of one sort or another to our southern neighbor. For their part, the Americans have promised Stoddard a good deal of autonomy to control New England, so long as we are ultimately loyal to their cause. This is likely due in equal part to their trust of Stoddard and their current inability to provide for our population as well as theirs. Accepting this offer will be sure to anger Canada, but they have little choice in the matter. They cannot hope to face the combined might of a rebellious New England and a vengeful and war-ready America, nor would they want to, having more important conflicts to worry about with the Syndicalists in Europe. Still, they will surely ask for economic concessions of some sort from the Americans. Should we go through with this?"
newengland.167.a:0 "We will eagerly await the American response!"
newengland.167.b:0 "On second thought..."

newengland.168.t:0 "Helping True Americans?"
newengland.168.d:0 "The Civil War has raged on for years without an end in sight, the Constitutional American Republic could use our help. We have given them material aid and small numbers of volunteers before, primarily in the aid of the NDWL and Ku Klux Klan, but the best way for us to help their cause would be to intervene outright. Such an intervention would not be sanctioned by Canada, and they have told us they will not join us directly, though we know they have mulled over interventions of their own. Should we go to war and aid our Southern brothers, or stay out of the matter entirely?"
newengland.168.a:0 "They need us!"
newengland.168.b:0 "It is not our fight..."

newengland.169.t:0 "Last Bastion of American Civilization"
newengland.169.d:0 "With the Nationalists defeated in the Civil War raging in the south, we are left as the only government willing to do what must be done to ensure the continuation of our species. Not only that, but we are also the only government left willing to ensure its future prosperity, a future in which a pure superior mankind rules the day. It is tragic that we were unable to assist the Constitutional American Republic more in their time of need, but we have solace in the fact that our work has progressed well here in New England, and our independence is guaranteed by Canada and the rest of the Entente. We will now commit to the Entente's struggle with the Under-men in Europe!"
newengland.169.a:0 "For New England!" 

newengland.170.t:0 "Canada Offers New England For a Price"
newengland.170.d:0 "With the Civil War over and our faction having won, the fears in Canada of a Syndicalist southern neighbor are extinguished. The original pretense for their invasion was to protect New England from the leftist brutes both inside and outside their borders, but now both threats are gone, and they rightly believe that we want our land back. However, the Canadians, ever the crafty negotiators, have demanded economic compensation for 6 months for their protection of New England while the Civil War raged. Some of our advisors cry that this is an outrageous offer, but if we want New England back, we may as well just give them what they want and be done with it. What should we do?"
newengland.170.a:0 "Fine, fine, they can have their money..."
newengland.170.b:0 "We'll get it back another way..."

newengland.171.t:0 "New England Decision"
newengland.171.d:0 "The Constitutional American Republic has emerged victorious in the Civil War to our south, and now they are asking for New England back. Though it might be painful to lose New England from our sphere, we have more important things to worry about. Besides, we could extract concessions from them that would prove useful in our war in Europe. What should we do?"
newengland.171.a:0 "Send the offer."
newengland.171.b:0 "New England is ours!"

newengland.172.t:0 "An Agreement is Reached!"
newengland.172.d:0 "After much negotation, the Americans have decided to accept the Canadian offer, and now we will be a part of their sphere rather than part of the Canadian one. This is a new day for New England, and the world will tremble at our united forces!"
newengland.172.a:0 "Hurrah!"

newengland.173.t:0 "No Agreement!"
newengland.173.d:0 "Despite our best hopes, it seems that Canada and America could not find an agreeable settlement to return New England to American control. This is devastating, but we will persist nonetheless!"
newengland.173.a:0 "A sad day..."

newengland.174.t:0 "Better Babies Contests"
newengland.174.d:0 "The so-called "Better Baby" contests are commonplace competitions that have been held in recent decades, usually in state fairs throughout the US in which babies between the ages of 6 and 48 months were judged for their health. Nurses and physicians judged infants participating in the contest on mental health, physical health, and physical appearance. The best children, in eugenic terms, have the biological potential to become the country's future elite. Such children should be given special care, be sent to the best schools and, if they are truly fit, even sent to universities. However, there are voices of criticism that say the initiative, although useful to promote healthy and superior lines, will not be successful because birth does not mean everything. Such critics are mostly from the environmentalist school of thought in Biology, believing that human intelligence and nature itself is derived from environmental factors rather than inborn characteristics. Shall we prove them wrong?"
newengland.174.a:0 "Social support for winning children must be guaranteed"
newengland.174.b:0 "This is a useful initiative"

newengland.175.t:0 "Negro Project"
newengland.175.d:0 "Birth control activist Margaret Sanger has postulated an initiative to provide Southern Black women and families with access to birth control and other forms of contraception. Free access to contraception and abortion would reduce the birth rate in the African-American community and act as a predecessor to more extreme programs in the future. However, this raises concerns that sex education, voluntary fertility control, and abortion accses for the Black population will result in Black communities having fewer but healthier and more active children. Others have argued that such a program would also embolden those of superior genes to use contraceptives as well, something that is infeasible in our current genetic makeup. Some organizations, such as the Eugenics Board of North Carolina, have previously advocated a combination of sex education programs with the compulsory serillization of black women who do not graduate from school. Which variant of the program will we choose?"
newengland.175.a:0 "The segregation so far is sufficient"
newengland.175.b:0 "Sex education and access to contraception costs little and will pay off in the future"
newengland.175.c:0 "Both contraception program and sterilization program are necessary"

newengland.176.t:0 "The Jewish Question"
newengland.176.d:0 "The Jewish question has turned out to be less of a question and more of a fiery debate. It was known to New Englander science that the Jews were not a separate race, but rather a mixture of different races with different attributes. For this reason, there was a problem with their racial qualification. Some politicians and acitvists, like Harry H. Laughlin, opposed any migration of Jews. Lothrop Stoddard considered Ashkenazi Jews as being influenced by Asian and Turkish races, which would make them completely inferior. At the same time, he considered Western European Sephardic Jews valuable to society. Even if they did not keep pure Hebrew blood, any foreign influences would come from European peoples. Many Sephardim have already made a positive record in US history (such as Judah Benjamin and Morris Jacob Raphall). The most complicated (and probably the most effective) of the proposals would involve examining each Jew separately and judging him for his IQ, body build, or skull shape. This research make it possible to find the most valuable elements and possibly obtain them for the new America."

newengland.177.t:0 "Superman, the Man of Tomorrow"
newengland.177.d:0 "Today, there is a new 'Action Comics' comic, complete with a new superhero named "Superman". The main character is not a human but rather an alien, originating from a planet where his kind were gifted with numerous abilities. These powers included being faster than a speeding bullet, being more powerful than a locomotive, and even being able to leap tall buildings at a single bound. He owed all these abilities to centuries of eugenic programs carried out in his homeland - the mysterious planet Krypton. Although comic books are primarily entertainment for children, some people wish to use it in an educational campaign aimed at children and teenagers. However, there are voices complaining that the comic book was created by Jewish authors Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. They argue that Superman does not promote positive values, and instead corrupts the youngest minds in our society. One particularly vocal critic of this comic, as well as the comic industry in general, is German immigrant Fredric Wertham, who argues that comics cause delinquency. For his part, the owner of the publishing house printing the comic has also spoken up. The owner, controversial former military officer Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, emphasizes that the comic book has an educational value and is a manifestation of 'truly American art'."

newengland.178.t:0 "Sterilization of Criminals"
newengland.178.d:0 "In 1876, the Italian scientist Cesare Lombroso published his most important book, 'L'uomo delinquente' or  'Criminal Man' (this American edition was published in New York in 1911). Lombroso's general theory suggested that criminals are distinguished from noncriminals by multiple physical anomalies. He postulated that criminals represented a reversion to a primitive or subhuman type of person characterized by physical features reminiscent of apes, lower primates, and early humans. Such features are to some extent preserved, he said, in modern 'savages'. The behavior of these biological 'throwbacks' will inevitably be contrary to the rules and expectations of modern civilized society. Almost all scholars, including famous anthropologists such as Charles A. Ellwood, agree that the sterilization of hereditary criminals could benefit society as a whole. For some, such a solution would be insufficient, and they go beyond mere criminals. They question whether it would not be practical to sterilize people with criminal records but also those with physical characteristics suggesting that they are predisposed to commit a crime. This radical solution, however, has critics among scientists, including the late Charles Buckman Goring. They argue that the differences in the physical structure of criminals and ordinary people are marginal and fall within the bounds of statistical error. Further, many lawyers claim that preventive sterilization is incompatible with state constitutions, but they see no objection to the sterilization of convicts. What should we do?"

newengland.179.t:0 "Religious Leaders Criticize Eugenics Programs"
newengland.179.d:0 "Religious leaders have for years criticized the initiation of programs to sterilize racially unworthy populations. Now that we have begun to implement such programs in full, many of them have spoken up in dismay. They believe our actions are breaking up families and rejecting God's laws. Catholics are particularly radical in their attitudes towards our eugenics program. After the Pope condemned eugenics, as well as women's empowerment, in the 1931 encyclical 'Casti connubii', most clerics called for a boycott of our teachings and now our programs. Some Protestant churches also equate sterilization with abortion. For this reason they are against it."
newengland.179.a:0 "What outrageous assertions!"

newengland.180.t:0 "Campaigning Begins!"
newengland.180.d:0 "[COR.GetNameDef] has agreed to hold an election with the Nordic Federation, with [COR.GetLeader]'s party facing Lothrop Stoddard's Nordic League. At stake is the control of the nation itself, and each candidate is campaigning across the country today to drum up support for their election effort. The election is set to occur very soon, and despite all the recent strife, it is projected that millions will participate."
newengland.180.a:0 "So be it"

newengland.181.t:0 "Voting Begins"
newengland.181.d:0 "Voting for the national ballot has begun with all parties involved using their campaigning skills and machines to full effect as they either attempt to bill themselves as fulfilling the desires of the Founding Fathers and following the Constitution, or claiming to chart a new American course that will ensure another Civil War and the injustices that preceded it will never occur again."
newengland.181.a:0 "We'd better win"

newengland.182.t:0 "Results are in!"
newengland.182.d:0 "The results of the referendum that will decide the leaders of the federal government are finally in, with the respective governments laying all their legitimacy on accepting the results. The victor is:"
newengland.182.a:0 "[COR.GetLeader]"
newengland.182.b:0 "[NEE.GetLeader]"

newengland.183.t:0 "Nordic Federation Offer!"
newengland.183.d:0 "Stoddard and his Nordic Federation have decided that, since we were allies over the course of the war, the two nations are more or less aligned and as such, should put aside their reservations about one another and conduct an election to decide who will lead America through Reconstruction. The winner of this referendum would become the leader of the nation and  Likewise, with only a few Supreme Court justices still remaining both alive and credible, this would effectively hand the Supreme Court to the victor, and allow for appointees in occupied areas to be decided via an informal proportional representation depending on the results of the referendum. As some in [COR.GetNameDef] believe this is a ruse meant to give Stoddard control over America when others have worked so hard to secure a victory, and they  are demanding they bend the knee to the will of the people."
newengland.183.a:0 "Accept"
newengland.183.b:0 "Finish them"

newengland.184.t:0 "Human Betterment Foundation"
newengland.184.d:0 "The 'Human Betterment Foundation' was an American eugenics organization established in Pasadena, California in 1928 by E.S. Gosney. It primarily served to compile and distribute information about compulsory sterilization legislation in the United States for the purposes of eugenics. Some members of the organization, including employees of numerous scientific institutions, went further than merely publishing and agitating for forced sterilization. For example, Lewis Terman was a pioneer in performing IQ tests to help determine the eligibility of individuals to participate in sterilization programs. Justin Miller was a judges who often adjudicated the sterilization of criminals and an activist to limit immigration from Asian countries. Miller was temporarily an executive officer of the California State Commission on Immigration and Housing as well. Despite the sincere enthusiasm of its members, the activities of the organization were previously limited. Will we give them government support? Or will we limit ourselves only to recognizing their activities?"
newengland.184.a:0 "Let us congratulate the activists on their efforts"
newengland.184.b:0 "Let's transform the organization into a West Coast eugenics coordination office"

newengland.185.t:0 "Eugenics in the Southern States"
newengland.185.d:0 "The implementation of eugenics programs met unprecedented resistance in the Southern states. This is not surprising because a large part of the local White poor has a low IQ level. In fact, according to data collected by John R. Commons, at least 6 percent of the white population should be sterilized. Due to the resistance of the white population, the attempts to start sterilization programs so far have been aimed at people of color, mostly black women who were sterilized without their knowledge during gynecological visits or childbirth, as well as mulattoes. For the eugenics concept, some support was also obtained from the southern elite. Among others, the supporters of the eugenics cause include industrialist Henry Ford, lawyer Malcolm Donald, members of military personnel like George Van Horn Moseley and Wickliffe Preston Draper, and even Young Klan Members like James A. Colescott and Hiram Wesley Evans himself. There is still a risk that the rapid inclusion of white populations in sterilization programs will increase social resistance. How shall we proceed?"
newengland.185.a:0 "Let us leave eugenics programs in the hands of local authorities"
newengland.185.b:0 "Let's use them to implement One national program"

newengland.186.t:0 "Mormon Eugenics" 
newengland.186.d:0 "Initially, Mormon preachers and missionaries were opposed to any attempt at birth control, and female activists were particularly active in this field. Julina Lambson Smith, the wife of LDS Church President Joseph F. Smith and mother of Mormon apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, instructed teachers to warn Mormon women against the evils of Birth Control. It should also be noted that during Joseph Smith's lifetime, Mormons had been viewed as racially inferior to Whites because of their perceived friendliness towards peoples of African descent (which, in the Jacksonian Era, was something no respectable whites engaged in). However, the initiatives of racial segregation appeared quickly. The Utah Legislature passed an anti-miscegenation law in 1888 which prohibited marriage 'between a negro and a white person'. Over time, subsequent postulates of eugenics were increasingly accepted by the Mormon community. In 1929, however, legislation was introduced to sterilize the disabled, intellectually handicapped, and sex offenders. Apostle John A. Widtsoe’s support of eugenics was reflected in his writings, where he wrote 'the present agitation for eugenics is really for more information... it is in this direction that eugenics work is now being done in Utah, and very probably nothing more important can be done in behalf of the science for some years to come.' Some Mormon preachers in 19th century, including B. H. Roberts, Joseph F. Smith and even George Q. Cannon, went even further and endeavored to use eugenic arguments to justify the practice of polygamy. In their opinion, a worthy man with many worthy wives was able to sire numerous and valuable offspring. Will we allow the Mormons to pursue their own eugenics agenda?"
newengland.186.a:0 "Let the Mormons carry out their own eugenics program, including polygamy" 
newengland.186.b:0 "Let the Mormons pursue an independent eugenics program with exclusion polygamy" 
newengland.186.c:0 "We don't have time for religious nonsense, we are introducing one unified system"

newengland.187.t:0 "Coal and Iron Police"
newengland.187.d:0 "New England has had a long tradition of creating private police forces. In the past, they were supposed to provide protection against bandits, pursue horse thieves, or assist the state police. The most famous and also most numerous such formation was The Coal and Iron Police from Pennsylvania. It was established by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1865 but employed and paid by the various coal companies in the area. The task of this policeforce was to guard the property of mining and production plants, protect businessmen, and prevent violent strikes. The services of this private company are used primarily by great industrial magnates such as members of the Rockefeller, Carnegie, and du Pont families. The methods used by Coal and Iron Police were considered particularly brutal, which is why some politicians from the old system, including Gifford Pinchot and Michael Musmanno, demanded that it be dissolved. Today, however, the old politicians do not play any role, and it is up to us to decide the future of this police force."
newengland.187.a:0 "We have no say over the activities of private forces"
newengland.187.b:0 "Let us use influences and connections to curtail dissent in our towns"
newengland.187.c:0 "Let us make full use of these types of voluntary formations"

newengland.188.t:0 "Order in New Society"
newengland.188.d:0 "Our newly-created libertarian society has legalized prostitution, gambling, most drugs, firearms, and pretty much any other good that could be smuggled. These things would be legal to transport and to own. All these activities were once illegal, but today, as long as they are the product of a voluntary agreement between adults, they are completely legal. Many former criminal organizations can now, at least in theory, operate openly and become legitimate entrepreneurs. Among the groups that have decided to operate openly, some notable groups include the so-called 'Gustin Gang' from South Boston and the organization led by Stefano 'The Undertaker' Magaddino from Buffalo. Private security agencies, founded by the citizens themselves, will watch over these businesses like all the others and at the same time will prevent other still possible crimes such as assaults, murders, and kidnapping."
newengland.188.a:0 "There is no organized crime in libertarian society"
newengland.188.b:0 "We will use these forces to limit criminal activity"
newengland.188.c:0 "We will benefit from what was once illegal"

newengland.189.t:0 "Jewish Property"
newengland.189.d:0 "The seizure of property from those who did not accept Sentinel policies occurred simultaneously with several anti-Jewish incidents. Albert Jay Nock is known to personally have a low opinion of Jews, and so it is not surprising that this turn of events has occurred. Nock's argument was that the Jews were an Oriental people, acceptable to the intelligent Occidental yet forever strangers to the Occidental mass-man. In this way, he interpreted the perception of Jews in the eyes of the masses: a significant part of Jews earned money by producing nothing, only speculating and gambling in the stock exchange. In his opinion, such Jewish activities were no different from the usual petty deceptions and swindles of criminals. However, he did not want to apply either collective responsibility or involuntary oppression to the Jewish people. Some elites, such as Henry Louis Mencken, were much more critical of this group however, and felt that they should leave New England."
newengland.189.a:0 "Seize their property by force!"
newengland.189.b:0 "If they are able to protect their wealth, they can keep it..."

newengland.190.t:0 "Clashes Between Private Security Forces"
newengland.190.d:0 "Like Benjamin Tucker before them, the Sentinels believe that a man has a right to either take or lose that land which can not be defended. Such a 'kraterocratic' attitude has resulted in a number of local conflicts between different militias, privte police forces, and organizations with criminal origins. There were many mutual accusations of racketeering or forcible expulsion among these conflicts. Clashes between the militia connected with the Nordic League and the organizations of immigrants of Italian origin (like the infamous 'Black Hand') are particularly brutal. Irénée du Pont believes that followers of Lothrop Stoddard should be supported in limiting the influence of mafia organizations. Others, like Gaspare Messina as well as entrepreneurs like Enoch L. Johnson, believe that working with Sicilian entrepreneurs would be very profitable. "
newengland.190.a:0 "Vae victis!"
newengland.190.b:0 "Support the Nordic League"
newengland.190.c:0 "Support Sicilian organisations"

newengland.191.t:0 "Refugee Crisis" 
newengland.191.d:0 "The civil war drove dozens of people out of their homes and into our land. For many of them, New England is considered a safe haven. However, crowds wishing to enter the asylum are of different value. For this reason, Lothrop Stoddard calls for a reduction in migration. Others, motivated by the desire to increase production, call for the admission of all migrants on the condition they agree to enter into 'voluntary' labor contracts. Groups specialized in finding people willing to enter into such contracts quickly developed throughout New England. This has resulted in numerous accusations of human trafficking, intimidation, and even sex traffic. " 
newengland.191.a:0 "This is Social Darwinism in practice" 
newengland.191.b:0 "We don't need that many immigrants" 
newengland.191.c:0 "Let's support the activities of these press gangs"

newengland.1092.t:0 "New England Seeks Allies"
newengland.1092.d:0 "Norman Lermond, while a Naturalist who mainly wants us to keep to ourselves, also realizes the necessity for allies in a world full of dangers. To find such allies, we may need to look far and wide, but regardless, we must at least attempt to make an alliance with nations possessing similar values and interests. Of course, the first nation we will reach out to is..."

newengland.1092.c:0 "On second thought..."

newengland.1093.t:0 "New England Requests an Alliance!"
newengland.1093.d:0 "When Canada occupied New England, it seemed that they would occupy the region for years, or at least until the Second Civil War ended. However, when Norman Lermond took power, the Canadians seem to have made a deal with the elderly socialist. We do not know the details of this arrangement but whatever they decided, it seems that it has been discarded now. Whether it be because of recent events or their own interests, Lermond's request for an alliance with us makes for some interesting possibilities regarding the coming conflict. Allowing them to join us could give us an advantage in a war with the Entente, but on the other hand, our resources and men could be bogged down trying to defend the area. What should we do?"
newengland.1093.a:0 "Accept them!"
newengland.1093.b:0 "Politely decline their offer..."
newengland.1093.c:0 "Ask for integration with autonomy"

newengland.1094.t:0 "The [FROM.GetName] Accepts!"
newengland.1094.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has graciously accepted our offer of an alliance. Now, due to our strategic location, we can greatly contribute to the future war effort of any of our new allies. Is this a new day for New England?"
newengland.1094.a:0 "Promising!"

newengland.1095.t:0 "The [FROM.GetName] Declines!"
newengland.1095.d:0 "In their arrogance, [FROM.GetNameDef] has decided to decline our offer. It seems they believe we are more trouble than we are worth. Regardless, we do not need foreign support to prosper as a nation, and we will continue nonetheless!"

newengland.1096.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Counters Our Offer!"
newengland.1096.d:0 "Though our original request for an alliance with [FROM.GetNameDef] seems to have been declined, they have made us a counteroffer. They argue that, since we are rightful territory of [FROM.GetNameDef] and belonged to the United States only a few short years ago, it is time to rejoin the Union. However, they promise a good deal of autonomy for us if we accept their proposal. If we decline, it is unclear what will occur next..."
newengland.1096.a:0 "A fair offer!"
newengland.1096.b:0 "Direct integration into the CSA! (Play as the CSA)"
newengland.1096.c:0 "Decline their offer!"

newengland.1097.t:0 "New England Accepts!"
newengland.1097.d:0 "Though Lermond seemed to be a tough negotiator at first, it seems he has come around to our point of view, and has agreed to our offer of integration with autonomy. With our territory reunited, we can look to the world as a country mightier than ever, and perhaps we will become the defender of socialism and syndicalism abroad..."
newengland.1097.d.bellamy:0 "When we reached out to Lermond with our offer, we did so as fellow Bellamyists, fellow Nationalists, and fellow Populists. Surely he realized, as we did, that we believe in many of the same ideals, and any significant differences can be chalked up to regional differences. These differences, ranging from views on nature to views on colonies, can be ironed out later, but for now, it seems that New England has agreed to reintegrate!"
newengland.1097.a:0 "Hurrah!"

newengland.1098.t:0 "New England Declines!"
newengland.1098.d:0 "Today, we have received word that New England rejected our counter-offer in our negotiations over an alliance and possibly direct integration. This rejection means that they will be a tougher to crack than we thought-and perhaps that we should take matters into our own hands to get what we want. What should we do?"
newengland.1098.a:0 "Maintain good relations"
newengland.1098.b:0 "Let them go..."
newengland.1098.c:0 "Invade!" 

newengland.1099.t:0 "Reconcile with the Entente"
newengland.1099.d:0 "Though we previously cut our ties with Norman Lermond and his New Englanders, it seems he has come around to the idea of an alliance with the Entente, and has reached out to request a new arrangement. This arrangement, he argues, would have to be on New Englander terms. From what we can discern, this would mean that we would have little-to-no direct control over the affairs of the country. In other words, they would be an independent ally just as the other members of the Entente. Though this would not harm us and would in fact likely be a relief to our financial advisors, there are other considerations. The presence of a socialist country in the Entente, regardless of how much they have distanced themselves from the syndicalists, could make us look like hypocrites. On the other hand, the presence of a functioning socialist nation that is not insane may give us a perfect example to hold up against the Internationale, and the New Englanders would essentially serve as useful tools. On top of that, we could use all the help we could get in our war to restore the British and French empires. What should we do?"

newengland.2003.d:0 "The group of refugees shambled along the side of the Hudson. They had escaped from New York City a day ago, leaving their Harlem borough’s as word spread that in the safety of New England, there were communes and communities setting accommodations or in some cases even being assembled all together to allow streams of refugees to settle down. It was a dubious claim at first, but soon more leaflets came down the Hudson, holding promises from Norman Lermond himself that he would allow them into his utopia in the making, and that he was a man who had made equality colonies and communes before, and so many would-be refugee’s accepted. The fighting was distant yet still audible as the group continued on; the cold was rough but the rumble of artillery behind them was all the inspiration they needed to know not to stop. The next they knew, signs and helpful farmers were guiding them into the newly assembled village of wood and brick cottage on a grassy bed by the Hudson, with government and charity workers offering them freshly made meals. Perhaps the sayings about New England were true..."

newengland.2004.t:0 "Cable Radio for the Masses"
newengland.2004.d:0 "This past Friday evening, nearly every radio in New England was tuned to the pioneering WGTR station (official designation: W1XSL/W1XPW/W65H/WDRC-FM/WFMQ/WHCN), broadcasting from a tower outside Worcester, Massachusetts. One of the first stations to use Frequency Modulation, or FM, broadcasting in the nation, WGTR has agreed to attempt a radical new idea courtesy of direct funding and support from President Lermond himself. Drawing on inspiration from Edward Bellamy’s love of the concept of a national radio program, President Lermond has brought Bellamy’s dream to fruition with the debut of the National Cable Radio Show. Operating as a form of continuous programming to entertain and inform the masses of New England, this revolutionary 24-hour broadcast features rotating performers and hosts, discussing topics from local and international news to comedy sketches and informative Socialist propaganda. Filling the airwaves ceaselessly with state-funded, creatively-free programming to entertain the masses, President Lermond with the help of WGTR has created a modern marvel in mass entertainment. With hit programs like the Yankee Weatherman with John MacDonald and The Midnight Zone, hosted by famed New England author H. P. Lovecraft, filling the airwaves on a weekly basis, the people of New England have never known such leisure and excitement, and radios have never been more popular."

On the political side of things, Norman Lermond has been venturing around the nation, both viewing the communes that have been created by his vision as well as visiting local farmer markets, and he is likely to establish good relations between the two work horses of this fine nation. Now with the news out of the way, let us end off with an announcement coming out from the universities and nature schools around New England as they are now accepting multiple promising students from across the communes who show both intellectual and tradesmanship promise.' As the broadcast ended, the crowds gathered around the communal radio’s began dispersing, some to finish labor work, others to begin gathering food and material for the trip to the next commune as part of groups that give supplies to those in need, yet all had one thought on their mind..."

newengland.2006.d:0 "President Wallace Lermond is a not only a devoted Socialist and man of the people; he is also a man finely tuned to the call of the wild. Taking on a love of living things and the natural world from a young age, he has long dedicated much of his spare time and professional career towards this undying love for life in all its forms. However, chief among his natural loves are the great, sturdy pines that make up much of his native Maine’s oldwood forests, and molluscs, from the lowliest chitons to the more captivating nudibranchs or cephalopods. Particularly loving marine forms of mollusc, sea snails have long fancied our aging President, with his collection of seashells alone numbering in the thousands and himself even having a species named after him. This love and wealth of knowledge has not wallowed in uselessness behind closed doors or within quiet minds however, as Lermond has published his findings and work at length, as well as contributing parts of his collection to round out displays and inventories of museums across New England. On top of all this, he also runs one of the most popular literary publications in the nation with his monthly issues of The Maine Naturalist: a magazine showcasing both scholarly articles and photography and discussion on a wide range of biological and ecological topics coming from Lermond’s own Knox Academy of Arts and Sciences, further fostering a greater reverence for nature across all of our populace as more of our fellow New Englanders subscribe to the publication. Under Lermond, New England’s wilderness and wildlife is safe and in well-guarded hands, both under his tutelage and for generations to come with his teachings. mollusc man."

Nestled within the sleepy town of Warren, Maine, the school has been afforded greater access to funds and prospective students with his rise to fame and prominence, the Knox Academy has grown into one of the most sought-after educational institutions in New England, with their biology and natural sciences departments now even rivaling the contending programs in the Ivy Leagues like Cornell or Harvard. With Lermond serving as Dean, Headmaster, and occasional teacher/lecturer, the Knox Academy has continued to foster a love of nature into the hearts of thousands across New England. The centerpiece of this storied institution is no lecture hall or grand library, but instead it is the famed Knox Arboretum: personal garden and grove of President Lermond himself. Originally sitting on just 60 acres of property, the grove has now expanded to envelop well over 100 acres of pristine Maine wilds. Divided into dozens of themed sections, with localized pinetums, quercetas, salicetas, populetas, viticetums, and orchards all winding throughout its ever-increasing expanse, with a massive grove of Lermond’s favorite species of pines at its core, it has truly evolved into a natural spectacle for all of our countrymen to enjoy. Together, the arboretum and the academy serve as Lermond’s proudest legacy; a foundation fostering a love a nature within New England’s shared culture for generations to come."

newengland.2008.d:0 "With the ever increasing levels of unionization sweeping New England with the rise of President Lermond’s rise in the wake of the Great Strike, greater emphasis has placed on numerous industries to unionize that would have never thought to before. To help drive home this idea of ‘unionization for all,’ President Lermond has decided to formalize an official union for his own profession. Creating the New England Malacological Union, Lermond seeks to band together all Mollusc-studying naturalists, marine biologists, researchers, and professors in order to protect the inherent rights of these intellectual laborers. Though only a few hundred number among their ranks at most, this move has pushed many other small, niche fields to unionize as well, driving up unionization rates across New England. Though President Lermond had political motivation for this act, he had long planned to create a similar organization including all Americans; a hope shattered by the harsh reality of the 2nd American Civil War. Everstill, Lermond and the mollusc union-members march on, now protected by the rights of the state while serving as a prime example on how to organize and unionze for the rest of the nation to follow."

newengland.2009.d:0 "Governor Herbert H. Lehman of New York has made a point of popularizing Northeastern cuisine as a means of differentiating New Englander identity from the greater American nation and the Canadians to the North in the midst of the Second American Civil War. From true New Englander delicacies like clam chowder, lobster rolls, Boston baked beans, and johnnycakes to true-blue New York classics like Pastrami and Corned Beef, Bagels, NYC style Pizza, cheesecake, and even the famous street meat of the Big Apple, Yankee food from all ranges of the palette have been popularized and pushed around the nation. \n\nMost popular of these local delicacies however, is a curious meal originating out of a restaurant called the Pump Station in Albany, New York. Known as 'steamed hams,' the recipe calls for grilled hamburgers, layered in cheddar cheese and other standard burger toppings to taste, and slathered in the secret Pump sauce, then finally served on a platter atop a bed of french fries. Despite the name, the dish has nothing to do with steaming or hams, instead supposedly coming from a unique Albany expression, though no one else in Upstate New York calls this particular dish such a name - even in Utica. \n\nRegardless of this odd naming quirk, they grew in popularity among New England's political elite and educational staff during the Second Hartford Convention after a roast prepared for the nation’s leaders and local intelligentsia was ruined in an oven fire, causing a blaze that some would say resembled the Northern Lights. Despite this disaster, these burgers have become a hit across our union, and with steamed hams and other dishes like it, New Englander culture shall thrive like never before!"

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920.

He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before armies closed down the border towards New England.

NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1913, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."

He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return.
