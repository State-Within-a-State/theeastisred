POLITICS_KRISHNA_WADIYAR_IV_DESC:0 "Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, Prince of Mysore, is a scholar at heart. Renowned for his great collections of music and literature, and singular amongst Indian lords for his patronage of higher-learning, Krishna Raja Wadiyar yearns for enlightenment. His vision of an Indian 'city-on-a-hill' however, was nearly dashed with the end of the British Empire and turmoil that followed. Now, as leader of Mysore, he strives to illuminate southern India, and perhaps one day, the entire sub-continent."
POLITICS_JAYACHAMARAJENDRA_WADIYAR_V_DESC:0 "Jayachamarajendra Raja Wadiyar V, Prince of Mysore, has succeeded his erudite uncle to the throne of Mysore. Jayachamarajendra, much like his uncle, is an academic. Unlike his patron predecessor, however, he is himself a noteworthy artist. Jayachamarajendra seeks to paint all of India, not just the Federation, into a harmonious mosaic incorporating the subcontinent's many peoples and ways of life; through skilful policy, his idealist fantasies may yet be in reach."
