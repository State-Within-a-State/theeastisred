POLITICS_KHAN_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventual anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913, he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as an officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence. \n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a two month prison stint following an episode where he attacked another officer in a drunken rage, he would serve once more in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the Whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently in his personal crusade against the communists. \n\nUngern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Elena Pavlovna, or ‘Ji’. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent. \n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. Though close friends and having similar ideas as the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Ungern’s ambition knows no bounds. With Ungern’s grip dependent on his Russian military clique, there are fears he will continue to siphon power from the Bogd Khan for himself. \n\nThese fears were made manifest when Ungern was wounded in a battle with the Gada Meiren, falling into a brief coma and recovered prophetic, hallucinatory visions of Buddhidst deities and ethereal spirits. Upon his reawakening, the Mad Baron was dead, and a new Khan rose to take his place. Maddened beyond comparison, Ungern now believes himself to be the reincarnation of Ghenghis Khan and the avatar of Mahakala, the Buddhist God of Death. Now, this great Khan seeks to restore the great Mongolian Empire of old and spread his reign and unique strand of Buddhism across all of Eurasia."

POLITICS_JA_LAMA_DESC:0 "Mongolia has long been a land of myth, mystery, and legends, so it is no wonder how such a peculiar man as Ja Lama has come to rule the Steppe. Once known as Dambiijanstan and born in the lands of the Kalmyks in 1862, Ja Lama has come far in his long life. Spending much of his youth as a peddler and soothsayer in Astrakhan during the time of the old Tsarist regime, Ja Lama would eventually make his way to Mongolia in 1890 after numerous run-ins with the local law and as visions assailed his mind of a destiny calling him forth. \n\nRising as a warlord and anti-Qing revolutionary in the heart of Mongolia, Ja Lama would solidify his position within the minds and hearts of the Mongolian people after liberating the city of Khovd from Qing occupation, and has since led the city as its bandit king. From this triumphant victory, Ja Lama would continue to pursue a harsh war against the Chinese settlers that plagued Mongolia while also working to elevate his position and image as a true holyman and Mongolian hero. \n\nClaiming to be a true warrior tulku, a reincarnating custodian of a pure Buddhist soul, Ja Lama has much of Mongolia wrapped around his finger, and has now risen to be its newest Khan. As the supposed heir and reincarnation of the Oirat hero Amursana and the avatar of Mahakala, Ja Lama sees himself as the rightful saviour of the Mongolic peoples and the promised hero of prophecy who shall finally drive the Chinese from our lands and revive the Oirat Khanate of old. A man of stark dichotomies, he is a bloodthirsty, sadistic warrior who is known to flay his enemies alive while also being an extremely devout and pious adherent to Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith, albeit an overzealous and mad one at that. Under his rule, Mongolia shall endeavor to restore its former glories as Ja Lama consolidates his grip over the Steppe."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Revolt, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, seized power. Now, Demchugdongrub's dream of a united Pan-Mongol state can be fully realised."
POLITICS_UNENBAYAN_DESC:0 "Much like many of the nobles who dominated Mongolian politics for many years, Ünenbayan was born in Inner Mongolia. Also known by his Chinese name, Wu Heling, he graduated from school in Chengde, and afterwards studied law in Peking University while also working at the Minister of Interior in the Beiyang government. There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Revolt, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardīn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."
POLITICS_7TH_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Born Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu is an extremely important figure in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu’s were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Revolt, the Buddyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."
POLITICS_JAMSRANGIIN_TSEVEEN_DESC:0 "A central figure in Mongolian politics, Jamsrangiin Tseveen was born in Transbaikal during the Russian Empire. He went to a Buryat private school in St. Petersburg, and eventually began visiting Buryat tribes in Irkutsk. In 1902, he became an auditor at St. Petersburg University. While there, he went on many research trips across Transbaikal and Outher Mongolia. After a few years he began to teach Mongolian Language there, and also visited Inner Mongolia and Ordos. When the Bogd Khaanate became independent in 1911, Tseveen supervisied a secular Russian school there and was editor for two newspapers, the Shine toli and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig.\n\nAfter Mongolia was occupied by Xu Shuzheng in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at Irkutsk University. He also travelled around the area and met with many discontent Mongolias, who eventually founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam. At their founding congress in 1921, Tseveen wrote the Ten Aspirations, the party’s platform. Following their failed revolution in 1921, Tseveen went into hiding in Transbaikal, helping continue to organise the MAN. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Tseveen helped rally Buryat rebels in joining the MAN rebels in once again trying to overthrow Unger-Sternberg. After this failure and the death of their leader, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the MAN went back into hiding. Since then, Tseveen has travelled across the more empty regions of Mongolia, educating the people and conducting research.\n\nFollowing the Western Revolt and the MAN takeover, Tseveen began to see the problems in the party. Over the years he grew more disillusioned with the more radical elements of the party, and saw it as corrupt. Following a power struggle in the party, Tseveen created the Mongol Libyeral Nam, as an opposition to the MAN."
POLITICS_SOLIIN_DANZAN_DESC:0 "As a young man, revolutionary Soliin Danzan was a living as a horse thief, poor and struggle to survive. He lived like this for many years, until he went to Urga to work as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919, he, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar formed the nationalist group Züün Khüree, which later merged with the Konsulyn Denj group, led by Dogsomyn Bodoo. For a few years after this, the MAN worked with Russian bolsheviks in trying to take over Mongolia. This culminated in the 1921 revolution against Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, which barely failed. Danzan went into hiding after this, as did the rest of the MAN. Danzan was one of the key organisers of the 1924 revolution, another failed mission which led to the death of Sükhbaatar. Following a dangerous power struggle with Dambym Chagdarjav and Dogsomyn Bodoo, Danzan became chairman of the party, once again in hiding. For the years since, Danzan helped push the MAN to a more nationalistic and less bolshevik group, completely disavowing from the failed bolsheviks from Russia.\n\nAfter the Western Revolt in 1936, Soliin Danzan and the MAN were able to seize power, finally allowing him to implement his policies. However, there are still many threats to his rule. The party is still very split, with power hungry members ready to strike. Also, the introduction of democracy, though something the party promises, could be a threat to the party’s rule."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DEMOCRATIC_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League.

Now, following Ünenbayan making Demchugdongrub Head of State, the Popular Prince finally has a chance to realise his Pan-Mongol dream."
POLITICS_GADA_MEIREN_DESC:0 "Few souls in Mongolia are as wild, free, and unknown as that of Gada Meiren. Like a vengeful spirit, he has raged against the forces that have beset the wondrous Steppe, cutting down Russians and Chinese alike in his crusade to free Mongolia from foreign tyranny and oppression. Born in the small village of Jam-Un Tokhui in 1892, the man now known as Gada Meiren was born as Nadmid of the Mültütü clan, once holding the Chinese name of Meng Qingshan - a stained moniker he has long since abandoned and forsaken. As the last surviving son of his family, he has been nicknamed as ‘lou ɣada’, the last son, which has become a sort of national nickname for the hero as the ‘last true son’ of a free Mongolia. \n\nAfter witnessing his lands be sold off to greedy Chinese settlers as a child, having his home ripped away from him and his family forced to flee, the young Nadmid swore revenge against the Qing and all foreign forces from that day forth. Upon reaching military age in 1921, Nadmid joined in with the local banner army, learning military tactics and earning his current title of Gada Meiren, referring to his status as an officer. \n\nAfter years of military service and further witnessing the Chinese rape the Steppe and the wilderness he called home, Gada Meiren attempted to peacefully ask the Chinese to stop their activities and settlement by traveling to Mukden with a diplomatic delegation, but were instead met with handcuffs and exiled back to the Steppe. This setback proved to be the final straw, and after his faithful wife Mudan rescued him from prison, he has served as a true freedom fighter to the Mongolian people and a horrid terrorist to the Qing ever since. \n\nHaving tacit links to the Mongol Ardīn Nam and their democratic mandate, Gada Meiren’s revolutionary acts and banditry has paid off, and after working with both nomads and peasants from the countryside and these pompous urban democrats to preserve Mongolia’s identity, the lands of the Mongol people have finally be saved. Now, Gada Meiren rules over Mongolia as its official Khan, but he has left the governing largely up to the MAN. Instead, this true spirit of the Tengri ideal continues his lifestyle living out the pastoralist ideal across the Steppe, ready to answer the call if the people need him again."

He has ruled Mongolia with an iron fist, crushing any rebellion and dissent he faced, like the revolutions in 1921 and 1924. He hates any form of syndicalism, and has a complete devotion to monarchism.

He fought many battles with the Chinese in this period until Urga was occupied again by Chinese troops. He began to open a dialogue with the MAN revolutionaries, and was arrested by the Chinese. He almost died in prison, but survived long enough to be broken out by Ungern’s forces and was cared back to full health. Since then, he has fought by the side of Ungern, owing him his life. However, his allegiance does not lie with Ungern, but rather Mongolia as a whole."
POLITICS_ALTANOCHIR_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nInner Mongolia, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAn inner Mongol prince, he travelled to Urga in 1932, following a career of commanding small groups of troops against Chinese troops in Chahar under Demchugdongrub. He was only recently promoted to general, following a good recommendation from Demchugdongrub in 1934, after they grew close."

Demchugdongrub didn't join Ungern until 1926, after Chahar province was seized from the Guominjun. For a few years after that, Demchugdongrub stayed in Chahar, leading divisions against Chinese border incursions. He even had to command troops against Chahar citizens, as many of the Han Chinese rebelled against Ungern's heavily pro-Mongol and pro-Russian rule. Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga in 1932 with Altanochir, and got quickly involved in its politics. After only a few months he was made head of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, and so he focused far less on military matters, though they remained important to him."

In 1907, when the Qing increased their efforts in colonizing Mongolia with Han Chinese, Togtokh formed a guerilla group to fight them, killing and raiding Chinese people, for which he is now famous for. Forced into Outer Mongolia in 1910, he travelled to Urga in 1911 after the National Revolution with his family, and the Bogd Khan himself promoted him to general. He fought for the liberation of Inner Mongolia 1913, and sieged a fortress with help from bandit leader Ja Lama. Since joining Ungern’s side, he has continued to fight many battles on the Chinese border, even training Mongolian guerrillas in Ulanqab and Ordos."

He became a military commander of White Russian forces during the Civil War, where eventually he came to Mongolia where he set up a business for Russian immigrants there. He was imprisoned by the Chinese still in Urga, but Ungern freed him when he took the city, and so Tornovsky joined him. He became the Asiatic Cavalry Division’s Chief of Staff. He commanded the division during the 1921 MAN revolution, and lead another division during the 1924 MAN revolution. He has become very loyal to Ungern, and hates syndicalism and socialism almost as much as Ungern himself."

In the Russian Civil War, he formed a guerilla officer group fighting against Siberian communists. He took part in multiple battles against communists in Siberia, where he was promoted to commander of White Russia. He commanded White Russian troops and had large control of Siberia. He eventually joined Ungern's forces in Mongolia, bringing much of his remaining forces. Ungern almost had him killed for opposing him, but he showed his skill during the 1921 attempted MAN revolution in Mongolia. He then travelled to the west, to have more independence from Ungern, still worried he will eventually be purged. Since then, he has continued to crush any rebels in that area, and has helped train Mongol rebels in Dzungaria."

After many years he travelled to Manchuria, where he published his first book. After leaving prison for protesting the Russian brutality in Poland, he wrote many more books. He moved to Siberia at the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, where he got involved in Kolchak’s anti-communist government. When travelling into Mongolia, he met Ungern and joined his side, due to his interest in Ungern's strange beliefs about buddhism and monarchism. He stuck with Ungern, becoming his Chief of Intelligence and a close political advisor. Following a diplomatic trip to Japan and then the USA, he went back to Mongolia, performing counterintelligence against the MAN revolution of 1924, where his intelligence lead to the attack of their base in Uliastai and the death of their leader Sükhbaatar. He continued to work counterintelligence, and grew even closer to Ungern, being promoted to the rank of general in 1926. This was mostly a symbolic promotion, for although he had commanded some troops in his time, Ossendowski was not majorly skilled at it, and did not have much experience with it."

He remained loyal to Ungern, fighting socialists in both the 1921 and 1924 revolution’s. He remained in Urga, cracking down on any sign of dissent or rebellion for Ungern.

After working in various military groups, in 1919 he was enlisted in the Zhili Clique army in Jehol. He rose through the ranks for years, until he reached the rank of colonel. He was assigned to Inner Mongolia, where he stayed until he was contacted by Prince Demchugdongrub after Xilingol was seized by Mongolia from the Guominjun. After some negotiations, Buyandelger defected to Mongolia, and travelled with Demchugdongrub to Urga so that they could be introduced. Buyandelger did not stay for long, and he soon travelled back to Xilingol with his forces. In Inner Mongolia, he continues to train Mongolian guerrillas in areas under Chinese control. However, many still question his loyalty to Urga. He defected to Ungern’s side very quickly, and some rumours even indicate Buyandelger still communicates with his old friends in Beijing."
POLITICS_URZHIN_GARMAEV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1888\nMakarovo Village, Transbaikal Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to the Buryrat people, as a member of the northernmost Mongolian subgroup, Garmaev initially grew up to become a language teacher. He felt little in the way of a call to any national identity or supposed homeland, living most of his life under Tsarist oppression until he made a life changing visit in 1917 to the Tsugol Datsan Monastery. There, the chief Lama recommended he join the fight against the godless Bolsheviks to defend the Buryat and Buddhist way of life, encouraging him to enlist under the local cossack Ataman, Grigory Semyonov. Garmaev rapidly gained Semyonov’s attention and was tasked with recruiting Buryrat speaking soldiers, a task which he excelled at. He was promoted to the officer rank and assigned to the newly formed Buryat-Mongolian regiment 1919, which was sent to support Baron Ungern-Sternberg’s expedition into Mongolia. Garmaev became enamoured with the Mad Baron’s esoteric sense of Mongolian nationalism, having already begun to form his own set of core beliefs, after his visit to Tsugol Datsan. He was encouraged by both Sternberg and Semyonov to preach pan-Mongolian nationalism to the regiment’s troops, as well as the civilians they came across, as a means to indoctrinate them into opposing the Bolsheviks. This eventually caused Garmaev to break with Semyonov, as he grew fearful that the Ataman merely wished to exploit the Buryats and the Mongols for his own purposes, whilst viewing Sternberg as a more rightful leader, who truly had the Mongolic peoples best interests at heart. He was rapidly promoted into a leadership position by Sternberg, and has maintained a great deal of influence, both within the Mad Baron’s administration, but also a growing popularity among the right leaning Mongolian nationalists who have come to accept Garmaev as one of their own."

MON_ungerns_mongolia_desc:0 "Mongolia is still under the control of Baron Ungern Von Sternberg, who has kept the nation under his grasp for a while. However with the ever shifting political currents seemingly speeding up, the baron will have to act if he wishes to keep control."

MON_ungerns_secures_power:0 "Ungern Secures Power"
MON_ungerns_secures_power_desc:0 "Finally, after so long Baron Sternberg has cemented his control over the nation officially after defeating the vast amount of opposition in the nation. Having finally defeated the hordes of Socialists, Bandits and Chinese, Ungern and the Russian-led military clique have full control of the nation, and their spirits brightened by this military victory. Now the nation is fully theirs to command and their dreams can be made a reality."

MON_increased_military_funding:0 "Increase Military Funding"
MON_increased_military_funding_desc:0 "It is clear that the entire reason the western revolt managed to last so long is because the military lacked the means to crush it. So now that conflict in China is looking more inevitable with the amount of hostility ramping up, we will have to increase the funding for our armies."
MON_cavalry_primacy:0 "Shall we prioritize the cavalry?"

MON_cavalry_primacy:0 "Cavalry Primacy"
MON_cavalry_primacy_desc:0 "Cavalry has always been the key to warfare in the Mongolian Steppes, so let us not discard it easily but rather master it. To even move through this harsh land let alone outmaneuver the enemy we have to accept cavalry as our main force."

MON_increase_gun_production:0 "Invest in Weapon Research"
MON_increase_gun_production_desc:0 "Our army's weapons are obsolete and nonstandard, with most of our forces looking like they just raided a museum with a mix of weapons from the weltkrieg to even the 19th century. Therefore if we wish to keep up with the aggressively expansive Chinese armies we must ensure our equipment is kept up to a modern issued standard."

MON_aggressive_industrialisation:0 "Aggressive Industrialisation"
MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Mongolia’s population often lives outside our few cities and even outside towns, meaning that our industrial base is pretty small. Thus we should start to encourage investors from Russia and other places to start up business and industry in our steppes. We will encourage and attract them with free reign, and seeing that we defeated the socialist revolts, workers rights will be but a false idol in our lands."

MON_train_the_nomads:0 "Train the Nomads"
MON_train_the_nomads_desc:0 "The Nomadic population of our lands have often been disunited, never grouping together beyond villages. To create a better use both of these peoples as well as to unite our lands further, we will draft them into our forces and give these land livers some actual useful training."

MON_create_mil_factory_angrily:0 "Set Unattainable Goals"
MON_create_mil_factory_angrily_desc:0 "Inside of our state owned factories, let us create nearly impossible goals for our workers to strive to achieve, by setting sparks of “encouragement” in the form of competition and beatings they will keep working hard everyday."

MON_marshal_of_the_steppes_desc:0 "The steppes are a harsh land to govern with their vast distances. Yet let all who are within this land know the name of their benefactor, their leader. Baron Ungern Von Sternberg is who the people of the steppes have to thank for restoring order."

MON_claim_transsiberian_railway_land_desc:0 "The Trans-Siberian Railway that runs over Mongolia has massive Mongolian minorities. It is rightful Mongolian clay, and though we are very unlikely to take it, it is a strong show of force for our people to claim it."
MON_ready_for_war:0 "Ready for War"
MON_ready_for_war_desc:0 "While alone, we must prepare for war. We are surrounded by threats, so we must act accordingly."
MON_military_propaganda:0 "Militarist Propaganda"

MON_we_stand_alone:0 "We Stand Alone"
MON_we_stand_alone_desc:0 "The Mongolian people have been abandoned by our allies, and trapped in by our enemies. Though we stand alone on the world stage, we must fight eternally for our independence."
MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg:0 "Centralised Power Under Ungern-Sternberg"
MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc:0 "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power. The radical buddhists and rich princes had large power in our government. Now, with them defeated, we can centralise power under Ungern-Sternberg, so that he can protect the nation."
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities:0 "Propaganda in the Cities"
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities_desc:0 "With the cities being the only main population groups in the nation, a massive propaganda campaign should be started in them, to entrench the idea that conformity to the state is required to survive."
MON_statue_in_urga:0 "Destroy the Socialists"
MON_statue_in_urga_desc:0 "Though the socialist MAN were unable to take power months ago during the Western Revolt, they still control some small cells, primarily in the hard to reach north of the nation. These cells must be completely destroyed if we are to be safe from the communist threat."
MON_young_officer_recruitment:0 "Young Officer Schools"
MON_young_officer_recruitment_desc:0 "We should try to get the best officers we can for our military, and a great way to do this is to start training them from a young age. The opening of multiple young officer schools in Mongolia should help bolster our officer class."
MON_pledge_alligence_to_sternberg:0 "Full Allegiance to Ungern"
MON_pledge_alligence_to_sternberg_desc:0 "The people must be taught that they do not have a choice in serving Ungern-Sternberg. The state and the Baron must come first in life, and everything they do should be to help the state survive and thrive."
MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg:0 "Encourage Myths and Legends"
MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg_desc:0 "Most Mongolians still believe much folklore and myths about history and current life. Many people even believe Ungern-Sternberg to be the reincarnation of Jamsaran, the God of War. Though it would not be stately to directly confirm these myths, we should secretly encourage these myths across the nation, so that people continue to fear the Baron."
MON_the_legend_lives_on:0 "The Legend Lives on"
MON_the_legend_lives_on_desc:0 "Baron Unger-Sternberg will never die. He controls the state and is the state. Those who have not realised this yet must be put to the gallows."

MON_democratic_mongolia:0 "The Mongolian Spring"
MON_democratic_mongolia_desc:0 "The Mad Baron has been cut down and cast out, made a fool at his own expense thanks to the heroics of Gada Meiren. With this act, Mongolia is now free once more to choose its own destiny. We must seize this chance, drawing inspiration from other democratic movements of the East, to finally uplift our citizenry and to let the Mongolian people speak up and use their voices to demand their own rights and dictate their own future."
MON_pro_republican_leaflets:0 "Circulate Pro-Democracy Leaflets"
MON_pro_republican_leaflets_desc:0 "Without widespread access to modern amenities and telecommunications, we must take another approach to spread these new ideas to our people. Leaflets detailing the glorious benefits of democracy and socialism should be distributed across the nation to teach our citizens to love and embrace democracy like it was second nature."
MON_declare_sternberg_a_traitor:0 "Ungern, the Traitor"
MON_declare_sternberg_a_traitor_desc:0 "Some in Mongolia truly believe that the mad butcher Ungern-Sternberg was good for Mongolia! These poor, deranged fools and ex-Ungern loyalists must be made to learn the error of the Mad Baron’s ways and their own poor judgement. An anti-Ungern propaganda campaign must be started at once, for if these vile ideas are allowed to spread further once more, all of Mongolia will be doomed."
MON_peasant_march_in_urga:0 "The Great Peasant March on Urga"
MON_peasant_march_in_urga_desc:0 "It is time for the peasants’ voices to be heard! Undulating and writhing like a uniform mass, a wave of peasants, nomads, city dwellers, and more shall come together and march for their right to be heard! Urga will shake and tremble under the footfalls of this righteous demonstration, showing not just the people of this city, but to all Mongolians that they have the right to use their voice."
MON_seize_princes_wealth:0 "Seize the Nobles’ Wealth"
MON_seize_princes_wealth_desc:0 "The Yazgurtan Survaljtan, or aristocratic nobles and princes of Mongolia, get a large bulk of their power and influence over the rest of the Mongolian citizenry through their fortunes - fortunes made off the broken backs and sweaty brows of the Mongolian peasantry;  every cent earned through exploiting the fine, innocent people of this nation. Their wealth should be largely seized indiscriminately to help these people that they have spent centuries walking over."
MON_cooperate_with_monasteries:0 "Combat Buddhist Fundamentalism"
MON_cooperate_with_monasteries_desc:0 "The monasteries, the more neutral ones at least, are not our enemies. They bring faith and goodwill to our people, aid in tax collection and humanitarian works, and serve as our link to the gods themselves. We should try to work with them to destroy the rising tide of radical Buddhist influences and fundamentalism that has begun to sway many sects and monasteries to more dangerous ideals. Together, we can help promote our new democractic system we are trying to establish while keeping our Gelug faith pure and serene."
MON_remove_corrupt_aristocrats:0 "Excise Corrupt Aristocrats"
MON_remove_corrupt_aristocrats_desc:0 "The aristocratic princes and nobles are what is keeping the people down! Their corruption cannot go unpunished, and they must be removed from their posts at all costs. Only fairly elected officials must hold positions of power in our new government. Nepotism and corruption shall, hopefully, be a thing of the past!"
MON_remove_russians_from_government:0 "Remove the Last Russians from Power"
MON_remove_russians_from_government_desc:0 "Many Russian nationals still work in our government, holding secret sympathies to either the Baron, the various other Russian warlords who still plague our lands, or to their accursed Motherland itself. They must be removed from all positions of power if we are to keep our regime safe and this democratic dream alive."
MON_declare_the_mongolian_republic:0 "Declare a Constitutional Monarchy"
MON_declare_the_mongolian_republic_desc:0 "Finally, we have succeeded! Democracy and socialism have won out in Urga and the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutukhu has been restored to a position of prominence and prestige as the spiritual and now political father of our nation. Now, we must work together in our crusade to transform Mongolia into a truly democratic and equal society under our new King, the Bogd Khan."
MON_empower_the_workers:0 "Empower the Arats"
MON_empower_the_workers_desc:0 "The arats, or peasant class, form the overwhelming and massive majority of Mongolian citizenry, and yet they hold next to no power against the nobles, monks, and other officials that crowd out Mongolia’s bureaucracy with their greed. They must be given far more rights and must become equal to those nobles who oppressed them before lest our entire democratic dream collapse before it has truly begun."
MON_redistribute_wealth:0 "Radical Wealth Redistribution"
MON_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "The noble princes have hoarded their fortunes, accumulating most of Mongolia’s wealth and keeping it for themselves - wealth earned from exploiting the arats. Now, with the foundations of our democracy established, we are in a position to be able to seize these fortunes and redistribute them to the true Mongolians who have suffered for decades under this aristocratic kleptocracy. "
MON_lower_monastery_funding:0 "Reevaluate Monastery Funding"
MON_lower_monastery_funding_desc:0 "The various Gelug Bhuddhist monasteries gain a large amount of funding from our central government based in Urga which they use to upkeep these holy sites and relics while also performing their lavish rituals and living in serene opulence. Perhaps this budget  should be re-evaluated to see whether these funds could be put to better use."
MON_seize_land_from_rich_landowners:0 "Seize the Steppe from the Nobility"
MON_seize_land_from_rich_landowners_desc:0 "The Yazgurtan Survaljtan own most of the workable land in Mongolia, forcing the rest of our populace to either work these nobles’ lands as practical serfs or struggle to tend to the arid lands left unclaimed. These greedy nobles do not deserve all this wondrous land, and so our new state shall seize much of their less-profitable and under-utilized acres and equally distribute it among the arats."
MON_remove_power_from_nobles:0 "Leash the Yazgurtan Survaljtan"
MON_remove_power_from_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have oppressed the people’s will for long enough, and the previous government under Ungern-Sternberg practically helped them do it! Laws and policies must be repealed that give these nobles and princes extra incentives and additional rights over their fellow man so that this new democracy we are building up can be truly equitable and free."
MON_mongolian_consitution:0 "Draft the Mongolian Constitution"
MON_mongolian_consitution_desc:0 "With the foundations of our new democracy established, we can not finally pen a new document outlining the new laws and guidelines for this shining new republic we have built. A constitution all our own will help us solidify Mongolia as a truly democratic state, free from oppression, autocracy, and greed. Once this hallowed and defining document is finished and ratified, our democracy shall be fully made manifest, allowing us to begin the preparations for our first fair and free elections!"
MON_end_old_institutions:0 "Modernize Traditional Institutions"
MON_end_old_institutions_desc:0 "Many old Mongolian institutions are ancient bodies created either by the traditional monasteries or the Russian Baron Ungern-Sternberg. These should be ended so that new ones can replace them with far more modern and democratic systems so that our newly elected government inherits a stable bureaucracy and not some archaic mess."
MON_legitimise_government:0 "A Much Needed Legitimacy Campaign"
MON_legitimise_government_desc:0 "Many still see our government as weak and illegitimate, founded by peasant rebels led by the bandit warlord Gada Meiren. We know better however. Gada Meiren is a hero and democracy is the only true path for Mongolia now! A propaganda campaign shall be funded and spread across the cities and pastures of this nation in order to drill into the peoples’ minds that democracy is here to stay."
MON_limited_freedoms:0 "The Inherent Rights of Man Restored"
MON_limited_freedoms_desc:0 "For years, Mongolians have lived oppressed and subjugated existences without knowing the joys of true liberty and freedom at all. With the ascension of our democracy, this will change. By legislating a new bill of rights outlining the basic human rights each and every Mongolian citizen is now entitled to, true democracy and liberty shall be granted to our people, and this our people have never know these benefits, we can air on the side of caution as to not shake up our fragile society too much."
MON_revolutionary_military:0 "A Revolutionary Military"
MON_revolutionary_military_desc:0 "A new and modernized military is necessary to defend our new democracy, for the old armies of the Ungern regime were nothing more than mere thugs and bandits preying on the weak of Mongolia. We shall establish a new people’s military to protect this righteous democratic revolution at all costs."
MON_defensive_approach:0 "The Natural Bastions of Mongolia"
MON_defensive_approach_desc:0 "Our army is small, young, and weak, and our numerous enemies are powerful and numerous. Taking an offensive approach in any conflict would surely get us all killed, but luckily we have a few tricks up our sleeve. Mongolia is home to natural barriers and terrain suited for defense. With the rugged Steppe and the harsh Gobi serving as natural shields and fortresses separated by massive expanse of prairie, no enemy will be able to sneak up on us while we hold out within these natural bastions. With these defensive tactics forming the basis of our new military strategy, the Mongolian heartland will never fall!"
MON_defend_the_republic:0 "A Sworn Commitment to Democracy"
MON_defend_the_republic_desc:0 "The first commitment of our newly reforged military should be to protect Mongolian democracy and our people at all costs. This should be emphasised throughout training and service, indoctrinating every soldier in Mongolia to fight and die for this righteous republic. Our democracy must not be allowed to fall!."
MON_first_presidential_election:0 "Mongolia’s First National Elections"
MON_first_presidential_election_desc:0 "The foundations have been built and the stage is set. Mongolia will soon vote on its first democratically elected leader in history who will serve as the Prime Minister to the Bogd Khan and the steward of Mongolian democracy. Tensions are high and the electricity in the air is palpable as the nation sits on the edge of its seat waiting for this historic announcement! And the winner is..."
MON_UKN_win_election:0 "ÜKN Election Victory"
MON_UKN_win_election_desc:0 "The Ündsen Khuulich Nam under Khatanbaatar Magsarjav has won the election.

MON_reimburse_nobles:0 "Reimburse the Nobles"
MON_reimburse_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles, though they were in the wrong before, have been thoroughly mistreated by the revolutionary-democratic interim administration. They should be reimbursed for money and land they lost, at least in part, so that they can resume their contributions to our society and to our support base."
MON_encourage_investment:0 "Encourage Outside Investment"
MON_encourage_investment_desc:0 "For Mongolia to truly grow and thrive, we will need investments and aid from foreign businesses.

With this chaos now over and dealt with, and these new rights proving to make these landlords far more loyal to our regime, we have decided to consolidate and organize these laws into an expanded, formal Landowners Rights Act, which will enshrine these property owners as a prioritized social class above the arats and nomads but below the lamas and the princes.

Our armed forces must be trained and thoroughly indoctrinated to hold the Bogd Khan as a deity and divine avatar, and as such, must swear to defend him with their lives, no matter the cost."
MON_purge_the_military:0 "An Army Free of Heretics and Secularists"
MON_purge_the_military_desc:0 "The officer class is full of disloyal, corrupt, and self-serving officers and generals who have no loyalty nor faith in the teachings of the Buddha. Heretics, secularists, and even putrid Socialists are spread throughout our military’s ranks, as well as the armies of the various princes and warlords. These disloyal officers and soldiers must be purged from military service, and if need be sent to the next life entirely, so that a new officer class can be created - one free from vice and truly pious in their adherence to the Eightfold Path and the militant path to Nirvana."
MON_recruit_through_monasteries:0 "Monastic Recruitment Scheme"
MON_recruit_through_monasteries_desc:0 "The many khiids, or monasteries and other temple complexes of the Buddhist faith spread across the Steppe, receive a great deal of visitors and new tenants each day. Whether they be mere visitors, true believers on a pilgrimage, or wayward souls come to stay and train at our holy sites, these individuals are the perfect fodder to recruit into our growing military. We shall establish recruiting stations in these khiids and official training schools in their monasteries, training both clergy and laity how to fight as we prepare for war."
MON_fight_to_the_death:0 "Heralds of Eschaton"
MON_fight_to_the_death_desc:0 "People of Mongolia must be taught that the nation comes first, rather than their own life. Protecting Buddhism and Mongolian society is more important than survival and self-preservation, for until they escape the painful cycle of Samsara and reach Nirvana, they shall forever be faithful servants of our Khanate. Zealotry, dogmatic piety, and rabid fundamentalism shall all be proliferated within our state, fomenting a rabid national appetite for war and conquest. We shall prove our faith through purification and bloodshed as the heralds of the End Times."
MON_lama_officers:0 "Tulku Officers"
MON_lama_officers_desc:0 "The Lamas are some of the most intelligent and skilled leaders in Mongolian society, serving as the spiritual leaders of our people and chief advisors to the Bogd Khan as the leaders of the Buddyn Zövlöl. They should act as the officers, generals, and other military staff of Mongolia’s army rather than purely military men who are blinded by ambition and greed."
MON_buddhist_law:0 "Dharmic Fundementalist Legal Code"
MON_buddhist_law_desc:0 "With the Buddyn Zövlöl’s hold on Mongolia solidified, they can now move to enact their plans to enshrine Buddhism’s place at the center of Mongolian society. Following the cosmic laws of Dharma and the fundementalist, extremist, and hyper-zealous beliefs of the militant Buddyn Zövlöl, a new legal code shall be created for Mongolia. The various schools of Buddhism shall be enshrined as the state religion, and any and all citizens who break the edicts and principles of our faith shall be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
MON_militerise_police_force:0 "Militant Buddhist Peacekeepers"
MON_militerise_police_force_desc:0 "To protect the Buddhist theocratic revolution brilliantly orchestrated by the Buddyn Zövlöl, the police force must become a fully militarised force, made loyal only to the Bogd Khan and our council. These dogmatic defenders of the faith shall be the first line of defense on the homefront, providing security and ensuring safety and absolute piety within our borders. To handle any serious or heretical threats, our new secret police force has been given far reaching powers and access to the best military supplies our state can muster to eradicate the enemies of the state."
MON_protect_the_jebtsundamba_khutughtu:0 "Safeguard the Buddhist Faith"
MON_protect_the_jebtsundamba_khutughtu_desc:0 "The people and police must be taught that protecting Buddhism is paramount. Piety is key, and heretical thought shall only subjugate us further to the sick and cruel cycle of reincarnation. Only through strict adherence to Buddhist principles may we all attain Nirvana, and so strict adherence to Buddhism must be ensured by any means necessary."
MON_buddhist_education:0 "A Truly Pious Buddhist Education"
MON_buddhist_education_desc:0 "The education of Mongolia must be completely reformed, to instead become an education based on, and only on, Buddhist teachings. Children will be indoctrinated from a young age to act in full accordance with Buddhist principles, and all schools in the nation shall be run by members of the clergy. The only knowledge our people need is their faith."
MON_teach_in_monasteries:0 "Academia and the Monasteries"
MON_teach_in_monasteries_desc:0 "Monasteries are the perfect place to teach our new Buddhist education. This should be encouraged. The largest monasteries in the nation shall be partially converted into centers of higher learning, effectively serving as Buddhist universities. Here, we can better monitor everything our intellectuals learn and teach as well as better integrate what findings they do gleam into our regime."
MON_ban_all_other_religions:0 "The Non-Buddhist Ban"
MON_ban_all_other_religions_desc:0 "Other religions are dangerous for Mongolian society. Mongolia is a Buddhist nation, and therefore Buddhism should be the only legal religion. All other faiths, from Ak Jang to Orthodoxy and Tengri to Taoism shall be banned from practice in our Khanate, and only the various Buddhist schools and branches will be permitted."
MON_develop_other_religions:0 "Develop The Varied Mongol Faiths"
MON_develop_other_religions_desc:0 "Other minor religions in Mongolia should be allowed to remain legal, so as not to anger the people. Instead, these religions should be developed to help support Buddhism and Mongolian society. Oddities like the White Faith to larger minority religions like Confucianism and Orthodoxy shall be minorly permitted, and Tengri will be allowed to exist among the nomads. Under our watch, we can slowly influence these faiths and their followers in Mongolia towards more Buddhist ideas and principles."
MON_destroy_shamanism:0 "Eradicate Black Shamanism"
MON_destroy_shamanism_desc:0 "Black Shamanism is followed by small, mostly nomadic groups in Mongolia. This form of Mongolic shamanism denies any and all Buddhist influences, and seeks a total return to the archaic old religions of the Steppe, primarily focusing on old Buryat, Oirat, and Altaic beliefs. They should be forced to instead follow Buddhism or face persecution."
MON_evolve_shamanism:0 "Embrace Yellow Shamanism"
MON_evolve_shamanism_desc:0 "Black Shamanism can be evolved and altered, to instead act as a form of Buddhism for these nomadic societies that still follow it. By forcing Buddhist influences into these old beliefs, we can slowly bring many of these nomads over to our side. Doing so would be difficult without aid, but luckily such a movement already exists, called Yellow Shamanism for their relation to the Yellow Hat, or Gelug, school of Buddhism. By championing this fusion of shamanist and Buddhist beliefs, we can finally mend the religious divide that has fractured the Steppe for centuries."
MON_allow_shamanism:0 "Exclude Shamanism from the Ban"
MON_allow_shamanism_desc:0 "We cannot ban a faith that is so ingrained to our society’s history and tradition, even if it goes against our government. Shamanism is nearly as old as our society itself, and to cast off this tradition would be an affront to our ancestors. Genghis Khan allowed freedom of religion, and so should we, just this once, for this truly Mongolian faith."
MON_buddhist_brotherhood:0 "Embrace the Four Noble Truths"
MON_buddhist_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Four Noble Truths serve as the first teachings ever given by the Buddha, and form the basis of most of our beliefs. Dukkha teaches us that suffering and pain are inescapable, as we are all caught in the vicious cycle of rebirth that is samara. Samudaya, or the arising, fuses our Dukkha with our Taṇhā, or desire, furthering our pain as we prepare for Nirodha, or the cessation of this agony by letting go of desire and craving. Finally, Magga - the Noble Eightfold Path - opens to us, ceasing suffering and opening the way to Nirvana. Our state has endured these Four Truths in our bloody and excruciating climb to greatness, and now the path to Nirvana and true prosperity is open to us."
MON_follow_buddhist_principles:0 "True Followers of the Eightfold Path"
MON_follow_buddhist_principles_desc:0 "Our path and guide to the enlightened state of Nirvana, the Buddhist principles outlined in the Noble Eightfold Path should be enshrined in law, to make sure the people are working for the state, for Buddhism, and towards Nirvana at all times. With the right view, resolve, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and samadhi, or mediation, we shall open to doors of enlightenment to all true and pious Mongolians as we create the perfect pious state here on Earth."
MON_monastery_aid_program:0 "Embrace the Principle of Dāna"
MON_monastery_aid_program_desc:0 "Dāna, or generosity and virtuous kindness, is a key tenet of most Buddhist schools. Often interpreted as charity, our state seeks to take it a step further. Basic welfare and aid shall be given out to all those in need in Mongolia, as long as they are true and pious Buddhists that adhere to the edicts of the Bogd Khan and the Buddyn Zövlöl."
MON_develop_rural_villages:0 "Develop Rural Mongolia"
MON_develop_rural_villages_desc:0 "The numerous rural villages, settlements, and hamlets that dot the Steppe are struggling massively, especially in the West following the recent revolt. We must enrich these frontier communities, for they are the lifeblood of our nation. Over 60% of our nation lives like this, and as such these groups must be developed so that they can become self-sustainable and actually contribute to our society."
MON_construct_more_monasteries:0 "Expand Monastery Complexes"
MON_construct_more_monasteries_desc:0 "Many monastery complexes were destroyed or partially wrecked in the various revolutions, bandit raids, and purge Mongolian Buddhist have endured. We must rebuild the greatest of the monasteries lost to us, as well as construct a whole new series of them across the state - each one serving as a center of our power and influence."
MON_poverty_in_urga:0 "From Arats to Anagārikas"
MON_poverty_in_urga_desc:0 "The masses of arats, or peasants, in Mongolia have long lived in squalor, especially within the urban sprawls of Urga, Ordos, or Khovd. With the aid of the various monasteries, we must uplift these poor, hungry, and dirty masses. We must wash away their sin and their grime and bring them into the light of Buddhism. We shall offer them clothes and food and a warm place to sleep, and in return, they shall become Anagārikas - low monks in training made to be fully devoted to the state, the Bogd Khan, and the Buddyn Zövlöl."
MON_support_the_fellow_man:0 "Civic Uses For the Khiids"
MON_support_the_fellow_man_desc:0 "The khiids, or monasteries of Mongolia, must be made to provide more than spiritual aid and simple charity and services expected of most modern churches, regardless of faith. Using the monasteries as shelters, halfway houses, health clinics, libraries, schools, government centers, and more shall expand the amount of services available to our people while ensuring everything they input has been sanctioned by the state. This will also draw the monasteries closer to the central Buddyn Zövlöl itself, furthering our control over all Mongolia."
MON_benevolent_lamas:0 "Gifts from the Benevolent Lamas"
MON_benevolent_lamas_desc:0 "Some of the lamas and other high tulkus, or reincarnating holymen, of our society are relatively wealthy. Over the years of collecting donations, amassing hordes of tribute and holy relics, and living in lavishly decorated monastic complexes, the lamas have access to more wealth than any arat. We shall incentivize and encourage these Buddhist clergymen to act in benevolence to help the poor, in accordance with the Buddhist principle of Dāna."

MON_nomadic_economy:0 "A Nomadic Economy"
MON_nomadic_economy_desc:0 "For centuries, we have strived as a nomadic people with little change in our way of life. However, as the world around us modernises and develops, our present monetary structure will be utterly useless. It is imperative that we begin efforts to propel our nation into a new economic era, whilst also sustaining our ancient nomadic roots and its current significance to the nation."
MON_uliastai_factory:0 "The Hub of the East"
MON_uliastai_factory_desc:0 "Uliastai is one of the most important settlements in the nation, being a key centre of trade for hundreds of years, and the one of the largest settlements West of Urga. If we focus development and economic incentive on the town and its surrounding regions, especially regarding industrial development, it will surely complement our efforts to revitalise our economy."
MON_fund_nomadic_development:0 "Adapt to the Nomadic Lifestyle"
MON_fund_nomadic_development_desc:0 "Even today a large proportion of our population are nomads and live their lives in such a way. Of course, we cannot simply force all our citizens to abandon their lifestyles instantly, therefore we must adapt and aim to compliment it instead by aiding their lifestyle. This includes the development of roads across the steppes and subsidies to nomadic families."
MON_expand_urga_industry:0 "Expand the Great Settlement"
MON_expand_urga_industry_desc:0 "While Urga is the largest and most populated city in the country, it does not compare to the economic might or size of other capital cities across the world. If we wish to see Mongolia stand high upon the world stage, it is imperative that Urga is expanded, developed, and industrialised so that it may act as an example to the other cities across the nation." 
MON_military_factory:0 "Commission Military Factory"
MON_military_factory_desc:0 "In this new age of warfare, we are abominably outmatched by almost all our surrounding neighbours; our guns are outdated, our equipment is scarce, and the rate of weapon production is laughable. This is in no small part due to our almost non-existent military industry, which must be developed to support our armies and to protect our nation's independence from whoever may dare to try and take it."
MON_weapons_development:0 "New Weapons for a New Age"
MON_weapons_development_desc:0 "One of the main issues that have appeared as a result of our lack of military development is the lack of proper weapons, and we have been falling behind on acquiring new weapons for some time. Our guns are old and only getter older, while our enemies amass better weapons year by year. It is only a matter of time before they use them against us, and only through extensive research into new weapons will we withstand them."
MON_start_mongol_highway:0 "The Trans-Mongolian Railway"
MON_start_mongol_highway_desc:0 "The Trans-Mongolian Railway is an ambitious plan that has never truly been realised - until now. With government incentive, we can fulfil this dream and create a railway that spans across the vast swathes of land, starting with Urga and the surrounding area."
MON_khovd_factory:0 "From Tents to Houses"
MON_khovd_factory_desc:0 "Khovd is yet another settlement located on the far reaches of the nation, isolated and arid. It is often the site of trade much like Uliastai, but the settlement itself has undergone very little change over hundreds of years, being merely composed of many tents and camps. However, if it were to be developed into a proper, modern city, then it could prove especially useful in our developing economy."

MON_military_focus:0 "The Mongolian Military"
MON_military_focus_desc:0 "The Mongolian military has been dominated by mounted troops as the very nature of our nation’s terrain has caused cavalry to be preferred, however with two changing powerhouses bordering us we must think of expanding our horizons if we wish to keep up."
MON_military_factory2:0 "Further Military Industrialization"

MON_doctrine_development:0 "Review our Methods"
MON_doctrine_development_desc:0 "Our army’s doctrine has previously been thought of as being unstoppable in the plains of our nation, yet with the ever changing style of army on army clashes, we will have to review our style of fighting."
MON_work_with_our_territory:0 "Work With Our Territory"
MON_work_with_our_territory_desc:0 "We understand that our nation’s territory is hard to traverse, but it must be painful for an attacker to wish to cross it, so that is what our army will work with."

MON_train_officers:0 "Train our Officers"
MON_train_officers_desc:0 "Our officers typically lack the discipline and good training that makes what other nations call an officer. Therefore we need to start training them to be able to properly lead, and only then do they gain the satisfaction of being called an officer."
MON_recruit_nomads:0 "Nomadic Recruitment Policy"
MON_recruit_nomads_desc:0 "The nomadic peoples of our nation are typically moving around, which made attempts to recruit them difficult despite the large portion of the population they made up. We require this manpower pool to be available to us."
MON_recruit_from_tribes:0 "Tribal Recruitment Policy"
MON_recruit_from_tribes_desc:0 "Not one area should be overlooked when it comes to potential recruits to our armies, therefore we should begin looking to the far and isolated villages of our nation to gather more fighting men."
MON_urga_officer_school:0 "Urga Officer School"

MON_develop_radio_technology:0 "Develop Radio Technology"
MON_develop_radio_technology_desc:0 "Radio technology has the potential to solve the issue of large distances between people’s, so if we are expected to fight in this open terrain, we should utilize the radio for our army to communicate across these vast swathes of land they are expected to defend."

MON_national_unity_front:0 "National Unity Front"
MON_national_unity_front_desc:0 "There are few self respecting Mongolian’s who would willingly be in a party that is accepting of the current state of affairs, However the Chinese want to put up the impression of things being allowed to continue as they were. So new parties are to be created and formed in a united front that will composite those Mongolians still allowed in government."
MON_reorganise_military_structure:0 "Reorganize Military Structure"
MON_reorganise_military_structure_desc:0 "One thing that has become apparent is how different the Chinese military thinks compared to ours, so perhaps by grabbing some doctrines from their playbook we can begin to remove those wayfaring souls that still cling to the old ways of the Mongolian Military before the coming of the Chinese."
MON_chinese_military_officers:0 "Chinese Officers"
MON_chinese_military_officers_desc:0 "The Chinese Officers obviously have a lot to teach us, especially after our defeat where our ignorance in the ways of warfare was shown. So let us begin to accept ethnically Chinese into our forces and learn where we were wrong previously, as well as start to gain some much needed Loyalty."
MON_purge_the_resistance:0 "Purge the Resistance"
MON_purge_the_resistance_desc:0 "Many Mongolians living in the far flung rural parts of our nation still refuse to believe in the new order brought upon us by the Chinese, if they even knew the Chinese were here in the first place.

MON_chinese_immigration:0 "Chinese Immigration"

MON_chinese_loyalty:0 "Loyalty to China"
MON_chinese_loyalty_desc:0 "We should begin to promote to our youth the idea that Mongolia is less of a separate nation and more of a frontier on the edge of China, that way we can ensure loyalty to China without provoking those rowdy separatists so consistent on being their own state."
MON_kuomintang:0 "Mongolian KMT"
MON_kuomintang_desc:0 "The Chinese Kuomintang has led it’s way back to control of both China and Mongolia, so the former elements of our own Kuomintang which has been buried in obscurity these past few years have recently resurfaced. Now both of our nation’s can be hand in hand with their similar ideals, for such petty things as separation shouldn’t be in the way of progress."
MON_begin_land_reform:0 "Begin Land Reform"
MON_begin_land_reform:0 "Begin Land Reform"
MON_begin_land_reform_desc:0 "Land Reform has always been something the KMT has put forward, both it’s divided right and left wing elements can both agree that a man who works the fields should be able to claim the field.

MON_push_for_industrialisation:0 "Push for Industrialisation"
MON_push_for_industrialisation_desc:0 "Economic Modernization has always been sought in Mongolia, but where before it was mainly for the profit of the elite’s grasp on the nation, now it’s needed to bring forth our market into the world stage as well as China. First thing on the list is getting rid of those informal cottage workshops and turning them into vast factories."
MON_kmt_military:0 "The Mongolian NRA"
MON_kmt_military_desc:0 "The National Revolutionary Army of the Chinese KMT propelled them to victory, for they were inspired by the prospects they upheld. Without these prospects victory surely would not have come to them, so it should only be expected that here in Mongolia we introduce these same ideals and teachings. That way our forces can be advantaged both tactically and spiritually. We will win in the battle of hearts and minds."
MON_kmt_propaganda:0 "Kuomintang Propaganda"
MON_kmt_propaganda_desc:0 "The Kuomintang value the prospect of communication, for there is nothing more powerful to a human than words. So let us here in Mongolia bring forth these words unto our population, for we desperately need our population to believe in something and gain faith in our government. Their hearts will be brought into line with the ideals of the KMT."
MON_kmt_mongolia:0 "Kuomintang Control"
MON_kmt_mongolia_desc:0 "Our attempts to bring forth Mongolia and China in one mind has slowly been working, but due to the nature of the people it’s been slow.

From the time of our initial conquest over the lands they now call theirs to our interactions with the famed Muscovy of old, to much more recent times such as the conquest of all of Siberia and their incursions into Mongolia with their accursed Trans-Siberian Railway, we have combated and sparred with these Slavs at every step and turn. We shall finally rid ourselves of these savages once and for all, and through any means necessary."

MON_start_myths_desc:0 "The man now known as Ja Lama, the warrior ‘tulku’, was born in the lands of the Kalmyks in the former Russian Empire and spent much of his youth in Astrakhan as a peddler - a fry cry from the average life of a true tulku. Myths and tales of Ja Lama’s deeds and miracles must be spread throughout Mongolia so that all learn the truth!

One such prophecy has long claimed that a descendent of Amursana would rise once again to lead the unification of the nomadic peoples and the freeing of the Oirats, Altays, Mongols, and all other of our kin held under the boot of foreign oppression. Our regime must influence these prophecies, planting the seeds of ‘truth’ that Ja Lama is indeed this promised son, and he shall lead the nomads of the Steppe to freedom and power."

Millenarian in nature and incorporating aspects of ancient Altaic spiritual beliefs with Tengri, Buddhist, Eastern Orthodox, and other various shamanistic ideas, this fusion of creeds and dogmas is led by hierarchy of oral historians who sing the histories of our very people, able to recall centuries of knowledge through song and chant. Seeking to unite the nomadic peoples of East Asia under one faith and banner, Ja Lama has latched himself to the movement. We should aid in the spread of this faith and make it an official state religion alongside Gelug Buddhism."
MON_embrace_nomadic_lifestyles:0 "Mongolian Pastoralism"

We should never set deep roots into the soil, for we are ever on the move as we move towards our destiny. Our way of life is and always should be intertwined with the land, but never pinned to it. Return to the ways of the Khans of old, for this Arcadian ideal is both our past and future."

MON_skin_flaying_desc:0 "Ja Lama, in his many years experiencing the beautiful brutality of war and human struggle, has grown a certain morbid appreciation for art. His own yurt is adorned with many of his favorite pieces, both inside on the walls and outside, fluttering in the wing like flags or tapestry. However, these canvases are no meager linen, but leather. However, not just the mere leather of lesser creatures like yak or sheep, but made from the mightiest and most ferocious of all the Earth’s beasts: Man. The flayed skin of his enemies is what adorns our Lama’s home, and this practice shall be spread across Mongolia - a true warrior-nomad artstyle for our resurgent Khanate."

Able to conquer nearly two-thirds of Eurasia in his own lifetime and earning a spot within the Tengri pantheon, he was a true God among men.

MON_scavage_guns_desc:0 "As we fight more wars and leave behind the ruins and rubble of battle, the lands surrounding us have become littered with the former equipment and supplies of our fallen foes.

MON_raiding_army:0 "Raid and Pillage"
MON_raiding_army_desc:0 "Raiding and pillaging is the true Mongol way, and our armies have had this ingrained in the very fibre of their being. While on the warpath, all of our enemy’s treasures shall be ours as our troops sweep through their lands and claim everything of value as rightful plunder of our righteous war effort. When not at war, our armies shall transition from a standing army into smaller raiding parties, sent out across our border regions and neighboring lands in search of bounty. No matter the state of our nation, war or peace, raiding shall be constant as a facet of the Mongolian identity."
MON_hunt_down_gada_meiren:0 "Hunt Down Gada Meiren"
MON_hunt_down_gada_meiren_desc:0 "The foul peasant ‘revolutionary’ Gada Meiren has been a thorn in our side for far too long. Though his actions for the Mongolian people are admirable and his fight against the Chinese noble, he is too much of a wildcard to be left in play. We must hunt him down and silence him for good. He shall be enshrined forever as a true Mongolian patriot for his great deeds for our people, regardless of his vaguely leftist views."
MON_raids_raids_raids:0 "Not a Village Untouched"
MON_raids_raids_raids_desc:0 "Every village, every town, every settlement, every hovel that hides an enemy from Ja Lama or is still rife with the taint of foreigners shall be burned to the ground. Not a structure will be left standing and not a trace of civilization left behind, for we shall obliterate the footprint of our parasites as we cleanse the Steppe once and for all."
MON_commit_more_gamer_moments:0 "Cut Them All Down"
MON_commit_more_gamer_moments_desc:0 "The Mongolian populace must be made pure and wholly Mongolian. Our fellow Mongolics, from the mighty Oirats to the Alatic peoples and even the far-off Kalmyks, our shared people are righteous. However, not all races can be so lucky. The last of the Russian and Chinese settlers too stubborn or foolish to leave will be dealt with so that Mongolia can once more be pure."

MON_lamas_fifedom_desc:0 "Mongolia has been cleansed of foregin parasites, internal weaknesses, and ideological poison. These lands are ruled by Ja Lama now, and all in Mongolia must swear fealty to him. Though he is still tacitly linked to the Bogd Khan and his authority, all know that Ja Lama is truly the one in charge.

Under his rule, the lands of the Mongols shall be cleansed of any and all taint of Chinese culture, society, history, and any other aspect of their identity and ways of life. Our Khantae shall be freed of the Gamin and made purely, wholly Mongolic as we build a new society for our people."
MON_agricultural_development:0 "An Agricultural Revolution"
MON_agricultural_development_desc:0 "Though we are a nomadic people, we also must be self-sufficient, and we cannot feed an entire growing nation on the bounties of the wild alone. Ja Lama has envisioned a Nomadic Agricultural Revolution for Mongolia, where massive farms would be built to the fertile East of the nation, with farm-hands rotating so that workers are not separated from the nomadic lifestyle for too long, while the West and interior of the nation surrounding the Gobi would serve as pasture land for our ever-growing grazing herds. Though expensive, it is just what Mongolia needs to feed its populace while also staying true to its nomadic roots."
MON_expanded_education:0 "A True Mongol Education"
MON_expanded_education_desc:0 "Every child in the state must be given a proper education, teaching them the ways of their nomadic heritage, the faiths of their people, and the true history of the Mongolian peoples. With much of the curriculum being penned by Ja Lama himself with loyal academics and spiritual leaders grainting their guidance, a new educational code shall be created for all Mongol children to learn. The next generation will know the truth of the Mongolian legacy!"
MON_fight_corruption_clergy:0 "Cleanse the Clergy"
MON_fight_corruption_clergy_desc:0 "Much of the clergy within Mongolia are corrupt, with tainted and dubiously-motivated monks and lower tulkus preying on the good faith of our people for their own gain. We shall bring these false soothsayers to the sword, and replace them with loyal, pious new servants to the gods. These new priests shall have true loyalty to the White Faith and Buddhism, but also to Ja Lama himself."

MON_nomadic_primacy_desc:0 "We are the people of the yurt, the true and original nomads of East Asia, and the eternal wanderers of the Steppe. The nomadic lifestyle is the foundation of our religions, our society, our culture, our military, and so on. It is the very identity of the true Mongols, and so all true Mongols today shall live as their ancestors did.

MON_raid_economy_desc:0 "The very lifeblood of our entire economy is based on bounty, plunder, treasure, and the fruits beared by our countless hordes of raiders and riders and that roam East Asia for the good of our Khanate.

MON_control_the_monastaries_desc:0 "The many Buddhist, Tengrist, and other monasteries and churches that dot these lands must be swayed to our side, one way or another.

MON_nobility_problem:0 "The Issue of the Nobility"
MON_nobility_problem_desc:0 "The princes and nobles of the Yazgurtan Survaljtan have nearly always been influential in Mongolia, long ruling these lands before the rise of the Bloody Baron.

MON_end_gada_meiren_desc:0 "Gada Meiren, the nomadic people’s hero of the Steppe, has long raiding our borders, settlements, and farmlands, salting our fields and slaughtering our people in the name of a ‘free’ Mongolia.

Long has the Dragon of the South eyed the Steppe for conquest and colonial enterprise, but they shall not have this chance. We will drive out the last of the Chinese settlers and their imperialist holdouts, for Mongolia belongs to the Russian Bear and no one else."
MON_anfu:0 "Rebirth of the Anhui Clique"
MON_anfu_desc:0 "Long exiled to the Steppe since the disaster that was the Northern Expedition, the Anhui Clique has once again established a stable foothold after nearly dying out after the German Intervention.

MON_srs_desc:0 "Named for an archaic script designed by Zanabazar, the first leader of Tibettan Buddhism, to standardize Mongolian, Sanskrit, and Tibetan writings, the Soyombo Revival Society is an odd group of Russian immigrants and generals who model themselves on ancient Mongolian secret societies. Holding minorly esoteric views on spirituality and syncretic religions, this varied band of Russian nationals will now drive Mongolia towards a new destiny: the revival of Russia colonialism in East Asia and the completion of the Zheltorossiyan plan."
MON_cuck_to_trm:0 "An Ode to Vladivostok"
MON_cuck_to_trm_desc:0 "We must align with the rightful Russian Government that has been long exiled to Vladivostok. Not only is their capital far closer to ours, making cooperation far easier, but also their time living at the end of the world in a harsh environment makes them kindred spirits with the Russians of our lands. We shall tame the Steppe, and they shall tame Siberia, and together, we shall retake Moscow from those decadent traitors to the hardy Russian ideal."
MON_russian_immigration:0 "The New Russian Frontier"
MON_russian_immigration_desc:0 "If we are to truly tame the Steppe and make it the new frontier for Russian expansion and settlement, then we are going to need more bodies.

MON_russian_colonization:0 "A Resurgent Russian Colonial Spirit"
MON_russian_colonization_desc:0 "Colonialism is in the blood of the Russian people. Since our ancestors claimed all of Siberia and the wilds past the Urals, casting out the Sibir, the the Altay, and many others in their conquest, the very essence of colonial triumph has been bound to the Russian identity. Now, with this new frontier, we have revived this spirit once again and breathed new life into Russia Imperialism. All of East Asia will now feel the pressure and splendor of the Russian people."
MON_russian_alphabet:0 "A New Mongolian Script"
MON_russian_alphabet_desc:0 "To continue our goals of Russifying Mongolia and eradicating their national identity, the SRS and our Russian benefactors have devised an idea to steal the very language of the Mongolian people.

MON_take_care_of_khan_desc:0 "The Bogd Khan has long proven to be an obstacle to our rule and total control over Mongolia. To circumvent his authority, we shall quietly and discreetly deal with this holy tulku, removing him from the equation entirely. Once they begin to look for his reincarnated replacement, we will either do away with his superstitious church entirely or instead mold the new child as a puppet to our rule, influencing him with the syncretic ideals of the SRS, puppeting both the faith and minds of the Mongolian natives."
MON_cuck_to_russia:0 "Kneel Before Moscow"
MON_cuck_to_russia_desc:0 "We would be foolish not to kowtow to the true Russian government. Though they are centered far to the West of the Urals, the exiled government in Vladivostok stands no chance against them.

MON_end_of_nomadicism_desc:0 "If Mongolia is to prosper and truly become a modern, profitable colonial state, and eventually part of the Russian homeland itself, changes will need to be made. Much of the Steppe is still dominated by the pastoralist or nomadic lifestyles of the Mongolian peasantry. We must wipe away this tradition and plant permanent roots into these lands, dragging this wild frontier into civilization."
MON_revenge_on_japan:0 "Avenge the Russo-Japanese War"
MON_revenge_on_japan_desc:0 "The Russo-Japanese War was one of the largest military disasters in Russian history. We were made the laughing stock of the Western World, defeated by mere savages from an under-industrialized and archaic archipelago. We shall finally have our revenge for this fateful blunder, and Russia once more shall become the dominant power of the East."
MON_yellow_russia:0 "The Birth of Zheltorossiya"
MON_yellow_russia_desc:0 "Like the Mongols once did to our homelands under the infamous Genghis Khan, we, the Russian people, have finally conquered and tamed the homelands of the Mongols. Now, both the Western and Eastern Steppe lie fully within the grasp of the Russian Bear as our flag flies from Harbin to Urga."

MON_foreign_research:0 "The Benefits of Foreign Expertise"
MON_foreign_research_desc:0 "With so many new settlers and colonists coming from our homelands to help us tame the wild Steppe, we have become flush with all sorts of experts, masters, and professionals from a wide variety of fields. By employing these new knowledgeable citizens into our regime, we shall reap the benefits of their expertise. From agriculture to the most modern industry, all fields of study in Mongolia shall be improved."

MON_promise_autonomy:0 "A Deal for Autonomy"
MON_promise_autonomy_desc:0 "We shall strike a deal with these wild nomads, and a simple one that even brutes like them could understand. We shall promise them nominal independence under our restored Chinese state if, and only if, these savages of the Steppe serve as shock troopers and meat shields for our more valuable military assets. We shall use Chinese brains and Mongol blood to save China, and in return, they will be allowed to keep their wasteland."
MON_mondernize_mongolia:0 "The Push for a Modern Mongolia"
MON_mondernize_mongolia_desc:0 "Mongolia is a non-industrialized, archaic backwater that reeks of horse dung and dirty peasants. We must bring the modern world to Mongolia, for these riders run and scream from the idea of modernity more like it was their worst nightmare. The Steppe will be tamed, and this wasteland will be made profitable and useful if its the last thing we do."
MON_grant_mongolian_rights:0 "Rights for Service"
MON_grant_mongolian_rights_desc:0 "Mongols have long been second-class citizens to true Chinese, with the Han majority specifically being particularly harsh against the people of the Steppe. If we are to cooperate with these wildmen, we must stop this. In return for their military service, Mongolians will be given equal rights and privileges before the law and the government to any of our own citizens. Though this won’t stop anti-Mongol attitudes overnight, it is a step in the right direction towards true cooperation and coexistence."
MON_use_mongol_military:0 "The Mongolian Meat Grinder"
MON_use_mongol_military_desc:0 "Using their peasants as a meat shield and their infamous riders as shock troopers and fast-attack units, we shall use the strengths of the Mongol military doctrine to our advantage as we aim to retake Beijing. With their blood, they shall pay for their freedom."

With the even of battle approaching us, we shall assure these masters of the Steppe of our intentions of making good on this deal as we ride, together, towards Beijing."
MON_New_Administration:0 "The Return of the New Administration"
MON_New_Administration_desc:0 "The ‘New Policies’ or ‘New Administration’ was a series of policies devised by the Late Qing dynasty at the turn of the century that were meant to subjugate, sinisize, and assimilate Mongolia into China proper. Though it originally failed and Mongolia broke free under the Bogd Khan and Ungern-Sternberg, the ideas of this failed program have not. With the Anfu Club’s resurgence, the Late Qing Reforms will once again be forced upon the Steppe as the Anhui Clique seeks to eradicate the Mongol identity and culture from these lands entirely."
MON_chinese_colonization:0 "The Chinese Flood"
MON_chinese_colonization_desc:0 "The key principle of the New Administration was simple: make Mongolia Chinese, and the easiest way to do that would be to open floodgates and allow full, unchecked immigration from Chinese states into the Steppe. With more people than anywhere else on Earth, we will have no shortage of population centers to pull from, and with these new eager faces arriving in droves, we shall quickly move to outnumber and crowd out the Mongolian peasants."
MON_forced_sinification:0 "Mass Sinification"
MON_forced_sinification_desc:0 "A state-enforced policy of Sinification must be enacted and heavily enforced if we are to truly tame these wild lands. Mongolian culture shall be erased, their language supplanted for ours, their cuisine adopted and altered, their art and music changed and assimilated, and more. We shall not only tweak Mongol culture, but fundamentally change it so that it is no longer Mongol, but just another form of Chinese."
MON_erode_faith:0 "Erode the Mongol Faiths"
MON_erode_faith_desc:0 "The lands of the Mongols are home to many faiths we in China do not adhere to. Though we share an appreciation and zealotry for Buddhism, the sects we follow are largely different. In addition to these shallow differences, their appreciation and piety for shamanism, Burkhanism, and the Tengri faiths all work to erode our authority. We shall replace these ancient, pagan beliefs with the pinnacles of Chinese enlightenment such as Legalism, Confucianism, and Taosim, molding the spirits of the Mongols to match our own."
MON_control_the_khan:0 "To Puppet a God"
MON_control_the_khan_desc:0 "The Bogd Khan was the rallying figure that helped throw off our yoke of control decades ago, but now that we have returned to dominance over the Mongolians once more, he is in little position to oppose us. We must now make a choice on what to do with this aging old fool, for he could make a valuable puppet, but so could his reincarnate replacement, and with us in charge, who is to say it is not within our right to pick his heir."
MON_breed_out_mongols:0 "Genetic Assimilation"
MON_breed_out_mongols_desc:0 "With their faiths undermined and their culture in ruins, the final solution to the Mongol problem has begun to be enacted by the state. Through incentivized and sometimes even law-required interbreeding and miscegenation, we shall finally eradicate the Mongolian people for good. With these programs, we shall consume the Mongol identity and bloodline itself, allowing it to melt into the vast pool of Chinese genetics. We will steal their future generations as their elders die off, and within a generation or two, Mongolians themselves will be but a distant memory of an uncivilized and savage past."

### Events ###

mon.1.t:0 "A History of Mongolia"
mon.1.d:0 "Mongolia was under the control of the Manchu Qing Dynasty for centuries, until the 1911 Xinhai Revolution led to Mongolian independence under the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the head of Mongolian Buddhism, who took the title of the Bogd Khan. China still claimed Mongolia as Chinese territory, and Mongolia’s independence was shattered in 1919, when Xu Shuzheng, a Chinese warlord of the Anhui Clique, occupied the country. However, in 1920, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a White Russian military leader, leading his Asiatic Cavalry Division, took Urga from the Chinese, and restored the Bogd Khan.\n\nUngern enforced the Khan’s rule with an iron fist, crushing revolts and dissidents while making deals with the aristocratic Mongol Princes. The Mongol Ardīn Nam, a socialist party inspired by the Bolsheviks, was formed, and began a revolution in 1921 to overthrow Ungern’s regime. Due to lack of foreign support, this revolution failed, and the MAN were forced to go into hiding. Following the near-death and temporary coma of the Bogd Khaan in 1924 due to his poor health and a possible failed poisoning attempt by Ardīn Nam agents , the MAN rebelled again, claiming Ungern no longer held any legitimacy in the country without his liege. This revolution was harshly repressed, and multiple senior members of the MAN, including their leader Damdin Sükhbaatar, were executed, forcing the shattered MAN remnants into hiding once more. In this time, Ungern made deals with the Russian government, for economic and military support, and his forces were also able to seize Xilingol from the Chinese Guominjun. Ungern's rule was still shaky, however, and following a series of peasant uprisings in 1930 led primarily by Buddhist lamas and the nomadic patriot Gada Meiren, Ungern purged many high ranking lamas in his government, destroying much of the support he had accrued over the years.\n\nWith the Bogd Khan’s ever failing health and Ungern’s ever rising ambitions, the future of Mongolia is uncertain, especially as old foes and new enemies begin to stir once more."
mon.1.a:0 "What about now?"

mon.3.t:0 "A Charge Against Meiren"
mon.3.d:0 "The sun rose high across the Eastern Steppe as yet another unruly and chaos-filled day began anew to test the Bloody Baron and his struggling regime. If it wasn’t putting down the week’s tenth marauding bandit horde, it was once again doing battle with the infamous Gada Meiren and his radical separatists - no day offered rest or respite for the Mad Baron, and it has begun to take its toll. \n\nUngern-Sterberg has never been a fully stable man, and the constant state of war his mind swirls in coupled with the rigors of running a state as backwards as Mongolia have truly begun to wear away the aging warlord’s remaining sanity and health. However, nothing like a good fight returns the vigor and desire for conquest and power to the Bloody Baron’s veins, and fate would just have it that another fight was brewing on the horizon. \n\nTo the East, the famed Gada Meiren, rebel leader and Mongolian nationalist revolutionary, and his forces have been seen amassing once more, poised to strike into the heartlands of Mongolia yet again and wreak havoc on the Baron’s domain. Never shying from a fight, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg has rallied his forces of Russian exiles and hired mercenaries and tribals to ride to meet this ‘lou ɣada’ and his hobbled-together militias on the fields of battle. \n\nAfter marching towards each other for a full day and a night, the two forces met and began their clash on the grasslands outside the village of Mandurkhu, with the riders of the Mad Baron and Gada Meiren viscously greeting each other with bow and sabre. In a thunderous crash of steel on steel and beast on beast, the writhing masses of these rallied cavalry hordes slammed into one another with the force of a freight train, causing sparks to dance off swords and armor as red mist filled the air, turning the sky as red as the bloody soil beneath them. \n\nAfter hours of struggle and horrific slaughter, the dust began to settle as a calm quiet swept across the once raging battlefield. Though a pyrrhic conflict for both sides, a clear, but bloodied and bruised, victor is left standing, but who?"  
mon.3.a:0 "His forces routed, Gada Meiren escaped the maelstrom, barely, and fled into the Black Gobi."
mon.3.b:0 "The Mad Baron was savagely cut-down in battle, and Gada Meiren has claimed his head and his throne!"

mon.2.d:0 "The Mongolian Khanate has been thrown into absolute chaos with the apparent death of the Bloody and Mad Baron himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. With the passing of this false Khan, Mongolia is now free to decide its own political destiny, but no one said this decision would be peaceful or blood-free. Even now, the various forces that have long vied for power and wished for the Baron’s fall now all move at once to jump on this one chance to seize power before the power vacuum created by the Khan’s departure to the next world fully closes as it finds a new occupant to fill the void. \n\nFrom ambitious nobles to radical Buddhists and foreign interests, people from all walks of life and from all schools of thought seek to make Mongolia, our Mongolia, their own plaything, as if our nation was just a vehicle to achieve their own greedy ends. Whatever their reasoning, desires, or true end goal, nothing will change the fact that only one group can rule Mongolia. After the dust settles and these bickering, warring factions have had their shot at seizing the mandate to rule Mongolia, who shall stand atop the pile of them all to rule these wild lands?"

In a yurt at the center of the city, the Mad Baron now lies unconscious, writhing in agony and muttering broken gibberish as a heavy fever claims his body and delirium and delusion seize his mind. \n\nAs the world rages around him, Ungern-Sternberg was locked away in the vault of his own mind, oblivious to the numerous aides and attendants that now worked without end to try to revive their dying patriarch. Roman’s mind was a light with fantastical visions and near-prophetic glimpses of pure Nirvana - his very psyche and soul reaching out into the cosmic expanse and seemingly communing with the very essence of the Universe itself, though it is just as likely that these vision have less to do with divine intervention and more to do with the last of the Baron’s functioning brain matter slowly suffocating and decaying away. \n\nAs the voices ceased and the cacophony that stormed within his mind finally subsided in a sudden instant, the eyes of the Khan bolted open once more with life, now blood-shot and wildeyed like never before. Without hesitation or warning, the Khan let out a primordial scream that shook the heavens and nearly deafened those in the yurt with him who were tending to his wounds, before finally uttering but one complete phrase...."

mon.45.t:0 "The Central Government Falls"
mon.45.d:0 "The Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg is dead, and all of Mongolia is in chaos. The central government has entirely collapsed, and the only shred of legitimate governance within the nation is now rallied around two central sources. The larger of these two rallying forces has been the Mongol Ardīn Nam, the largest and oldest unified political party in Mongolia. Seeking to bring true democracy and modern reform to Mongolia, the Ardīn Nam are a large coalition of democrats ranging from liberals to conservatives, with the largest faction being the moderate socialists by far. \n\nIn stark contrast to the Ardīn Nam’s noble democratic pursuit, Gada Meiren stands as the other main unifying force within Mongolia. Though his support base is not as large, he has far more support among the rural and tribal population of the Steppe, and as an ardent Mongolian nationalist and war hero, he has even been able to win over many of the more nationalist or militarists elements that despise the more liberal Ardīn Nam. Seeking to radically reform Mongolian society, ousting foreign leeches in favor of pro-Mongolian populist policies, Gada Meiren has shown to be a strong force to reckon with and a true rival to the Ardīn Nam. Though their competition is fierce, the two forces are near evenly matched, and whoever wins out in the coming power struggle is anyone’s guess."

Bandits, revolutionaries, and mercenaries have all already made their mark on this city in the wake of the Mad Baron’s passing, and only chaos reigned over this city of madness now. \n\nJa Lama’s main prize was the central palace of the city, currently standing as the only bastion of order in all of Urga, where the Bogd Khan sits waiting behind sealed doors and armed guards, waiting for stability to once again settle over the city. Knowing that peace would not come on its own, Ja Lama and his forces knew what they had to do. Drawing sabres and mounting their steeds, Ja Lama and his riders would cleanse Urga of this raucous rabble, saving the city and the Bogd Khan first, then he and his forces would repeat the same in village after village and town after town until all of Mongolia has been brought to heel once more. The Baron is dead, and the Bogd Khan still reigns, but this is Ja Lama’s Mongolia now."

mon.47.d:0 "In the wake of Ungern-Sternberg’s demise, the various foreign wolves and vultures that his rule kept at bay were now free to spread across all of Mongolia like parasites and scavengers moving in to rip apart a newly deposited carcass. Of the two main groups of are the Chinese remnants of the Anhui Clique’s political wing - the Anfu Club - who seek to restore Gamin rule over Mongolia and later all of China, and the Soyombo Revival Society, a pro-Russian group composed mostly of old Ungern-Sternberg loyalists and other Russia expatriates who seek to turn Mongolia into a Russian client state bent on retaking Manchuria. Both these groups are well-funded and well-connected, and now it is only a matter of which one shall take over Mongolia and which direction our people will be steered in."

mon.52.t:0 "Re-evaluation of Monastery funding"
mon.52.d:0 "With the power now in the people’s hands, and with Mongolia modernising every day, one key thing to evaluate is the funding the monasteries receive from the government. The monasteries, though an important aspect of Mongolia, is a very traditional area of the nation, and many lamas even push anti-government propaganda, either harbouring back to Ungerns Mongolia or even supporting the now defunct Buddyn Zövlöl. Some in our government state that funding for the monasteries should be reduced, for they harbour sentiments of authoritarianism and traditionalism. Others in government argue that for now, it might be best to keep the lamas on our side, and to leave the funding where it is, or even increase it."
mon.52.a:0 "Keep the Monasteries on our side."

Now, discussions have begun throughout the party as to whether he is the right man to lead. Many people do not know him too well, and mostly see him as a noble bureaucrat, lacking much charisma. A figure of the aristocrats that does have charisma, however, is Prince Demchugdongrub. Following the Western Revolt, the Prince and many of his aristocrats remained in Urga, to try to keep their influence. Demchugdongrub has remained a very popular figure, and many have stated he should rule as prime minister, with Khatanbaatar Magsarjav as his deputy. Some, however, may see this as a betrayal of the democratic process."

mon.54.d:0 "Throughout Ungerns years as dictator of Mongolia, spending increased massively. The country’s economy is weak, and changes must be made. Ungern began massive military projects, all of which cost massive amounts. We, the aristocrats, were taxed massively to pay the bill. Of course, aristocrat taxes have already been cut massively, and to offset this we could increase the tax on the poor majority of the nation, the arats. Perhaps, we could even begin a tax policy on the monasteries."

mon.55.d:0 "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government."

They came for simple banditry, but it has turned into all out rebellion. The letter goes on to say that although their groups continues to fight in the west, they would be willing to stop, if given some money and supplies. It is a large amount of money, which we will need to find, but it will help reduce the size of the chaos in the west."

In the Clique, he was seen as a pillar of stability, who would stop any power struggle occurring between the very divided Ma families. Many in China even see him as the stabiliser of the Northwest, ending Tibetan and our own aggression into Chinese soil.\n\nHowever, news has just reached us that Ma Fuxiang has passed away. Currently he has been replaced by Ma Lin, but another Ma, Ma Bufang, and Ma Lin are already embroiled in a power struggle.

This is not wholly unexpected, though we should be prepared for if this escalates further."
mon.68.a:0 "This is fine."
mon.69.t:0 "Buyandelger makes his choice"
mon.69.d:0 "With his large force moving through Ulanqab, a thought occurred to Buyandelger. If he was to take Guisui, he would have de facto control of the province. With the Ma's struggling with internal conflict, it should not be too difficult to move his force through the region and to take the city. Now, it is whether he decides to do it or not."

mon.69.b:0 "Buyandelger, do it."
mon.70.t:0 "Large Mongolian force moving to Guisui"
mon.70.d:0 "Some of our scouts have reported a large force of Mongolian soldiers moving toward the main city of Ulanqab, Guisui. Should the Mongols take it, they will have de facto control of the whole region. Though there is a garrison in Guisui, many fear it will not be enough to beat the quickly approaching Mongols. Ma Hongkui is currently in the region with his force, so he may be able to fight them off."

There, he declared it now under Mongolian control. However, we can still act. Ma Hongbin is also now in the area, and could move his own forces up to try to retake the city."
mon.71.a:0 "We cannot act, leave Ulanqab."
mon.71.b:0 "Send a force under Ma Hongbin."
mon.72.t:0 "We have taken Ulanqab!"
mon.72.d:0 "After Buyandelger began to move toward Guisui to take Ulanqab, he was met with surprisingly little resistance from the Ma Clique. Though he had to fight some small battles with border troops, and had to fight through the Guisui garrison, for now it seems the Ma Clique have retreated from Ulanqab. Finally, Mongolian families have been reunited, and Mongolian rule in the region has been restored."
mon.72.a:0 "Good work Buyandelger."
mon.73.t:0 "Ma Hongkui loses"
mon.73.d:0 "Ma Hongkui's forces travelled for a day and a night to finally reach the Mongolian force. In the early hours of the morning, Ma Hongkui sent in his soldiers to attack the Mongolians, who looked like they were just camping. However, it was a trap! After Hongkui sent his main force in, a group of Mongolian cavalry had snuck behind and attacked on the back lines, at the same time as the battle going on at the front. Ma Hongkui's force was caught in the middle, and beaten. Hongkui was able to make his escape, but he lost the battle, and the Mongol force has almost reached Guisui."

mon.76.t:0 "Ma Hongbin has lost, Mongolians take Guisui"
mon.76.d:0 "Ma Hongbin decided to try to go for a full frontal attack against the Mongolian force with his own force, to avoid being scouted and routed by the Mongols. Therefore he charged directly at the city, but by that point he had already fallen into Buyandelger's trap. From behind hills on both sides of his force emerged groups of Mongol cavalry, who pincered Hongbin's forces, leaving them with 2 options: either retreat and concede the city, or move into the city and try to take it, then deal with the outside cavalry afterwards. In this critical moment, Hongbin decided to push through to try to take the city. However, much of his force had already started to retreat, seeing the city as a death sentence. With that, Ma Hongbin's weakened group were forced to retreat. It seems Ulanqab has now fallen into Mongol hands."

This morning, when his maid came in to serve him breakfast, she dropped the tray in shock, as she saw a frail Ungern laying in his bed, covered in his own bloody vomit. Many monks and lamas were ordered in, bringing many herbs and other tribal remedies. However, it appears the Barons health is not getting much better."

As they entered the room, they saw Ungern’s body, face down on the ground, collapsed. Upon further inspection, they discovered he wasn’t breathing, and quickly rushed to find lamas to try to save him. Alas, it was too late for the Baron. The guards stationed outside his room were executed, for letting him die on their watch, as were many of the lamas who were there to cure him.\n\nWhile investigating the room, a short book was found, written by Ungern, detailing what would happen if he died. It was read to a council of Ungern’s inner circle: Boris Rezukhin, Mikhail Tornovsky, Ferdynand Ossendowski, Agvan Dorzhiev, and Vladimir Roerich. Also present was the powerless 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. It stated that Rezukhin was Ungern’s successor, and that he must be protected so that he could rule in the Barons stead. Tornovsky refutes this, stating that he was Ungern’s rightful successor, but after Rezukhin pulled a pistol on him, he conceded. The book also stated stability of the realm was paramount, and that though Rezukhin will now rule, Baron Ungern-Sternberg will still be used in all propaganda, and his cult of personality will remain."

Any sign of stability that Kerensky brought to Russian politics was lost the moment the bullet struck his body.

Both of them even compared us to the dictator Ungern-Sternberg! Ironic, seeing as the Ünenbayan's aristocratic friends were the ones helping keep the Baron's government alive. However, their reaction to this is unsurprising. What is surprising is the reaction of the people.

The previous government, led by the butcher Ungern-Sternberg, focused too much on control through terror, when that is not what the people need. The beliefs of buddhism, something that Ungern claimed to follow, were noticeably absent in the previous government. The 1930 purge is evidence that Ungern's buddhist claims were little more than lies and deceptions. The Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu lived as little more than a prisoner, not receiving the proper training.

Though he opened dialogue with the MAN rebels at the time, he was arrested by the Chinese, and almost died in his cell. He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall.

Ungern almost had him purged back then, but his high skill during the 1921 MAN Revolution made Ungern let him stay. After that, he travelled to the west of the nation, to put down rebellion and to train anti-Chinese forces in the province of Dzungaria. It is clear that in this mission he failed. At the start of the Western Revolt, he was in Dzungaria, rather than doing his job of putting down anti-government activity. Ungerns mistrust of him was obviously justified.

He was promoted to the rank of general by the Bogd Khan himself, after he came to Urga following the revolution against the Chinese. In expelling Chinese troops, he worked with bandit leader Ja Lama multiple times. This is where the worry about Togtokh Taij lies. It was Ja Lamas Yum-Beise bandits who sparked the start of the Western Revolt just months ago. Perhaps Togtokh Taij organised the bandits into rebelling, so that he could gain power for himself."

With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. Rezukhin commented that it was the fault of the workers doing poor work, a statement Ungern agreed with."

So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."

After hearing that they were going to have their lands seized to be distributed to the populus, a few princes decided to unite their guards to protect their lands. After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."

The particular passage of note describes a beast that resides in the Gobi Desert, slinking beneath the great dunes of that accursed hellscape. Described by Andrews in the novel, supposedly quoting Damdinbazar directly as being ‘...shaped like a sausage about two feet long, has no head nor leg and it is so poisonous that merely to touch it means instant death. It lives in the most desolate parts of the Gobi Desert.' This account has left many readers reeling, with many more seeking to take a trip to the wild Gobi just to catch a glimpse of this living cryptid alive. Though many local nomadic tribes and old explorers may know better to believe these myths, with many believing these supposed ‘Death Worm sightings’ is no more than delirious, water-deprived explorers running scared from sand boas, this has not deterred this myth from spreading like wildfire. From the sands of the Gobi to the hustle and bustle of New York City, all will now know the great and legendary beast that is the ‘Mongolian Death Worm,’ and though that, all who did not once pay attention to Mongolia certainly do now!

What formerly stood here as a colonial settlement of Han Chinese settlers now only existed as a pile of embers and rubble, blood stained and abandoned by all. The center square of the town, once alive with the energy of life, now sat vacant and quiet, save for the cawing of crows that feasted on the scattered remains of this settlement’s former inhabitants. The streets, once busy and packed with caravans and trade stalls, were now filled with towering horrors that spilled a pungent, almost toxic miasma into the air that could bring even the most steeled soldier to their knees, eyes watering and retching. Not beast or being, these decaying, half-burned mounds of flesh and viscera are all that remains of those who once lived here - hastily constructed failed funeral pyres extinguished before reaching full burn, with their fuel melting together and now left to rot in the Mongolian sun as the vultures of the Steppe pick these bones for scraps. Erected by the perpetrators of this horrific attack, their sight and stench now serve as a warning to all who dare enter these lands who are not of Mongolian blood, for these lands belong to Ja Lama now. \n\nOnce a shining example of Chinese colonialism, this smoldering ruin is now nothing more than a black stain the Steppe - a lasting symbol of retribution and pure, unmitigated hatred that shall be repeated a hundred times across Mongolia and more as Ja Lama and his hordes continue their purification crusade across the Steppe.

Combining elements of Mongolian shamanism, Tengirsm, Gelug Buddhism, Eastern Orthodoxy, archaic Altaic prehistorical belief systems, and many other lesser sources, Ak Jang could potentially be the one true faith to unify the Mongolic peoples. \n\nStriving for the Dzungari Ideal and preaching that a legendary heir of Amursana shall ride forth to save and enlighten the Mongolic people, the religion has already been co-opted by our ruling regime as a way to legitimize Ja Lama’s rule. Our Khan supposedly even fancies himself as this promised hero, and has reportedly begun spreading this idea around himself as some sort of prophet of ‘Ak-Burkhan', the main deity of the White Faith, with the aid of his loyal clergymen and shamans who follow his every command as if he were a god himself.

Though Urga still served as the capital of Mongolia and the seat of its government, across the Steppe to the West in Khovd is where the heart of Ja Lama’s domain truly lied. Since his rescuing of the city from its former Han overlords, Ja Lama has spent the last decade and a half or more slowly transforming the once meager settlement of Khovd into his personal fortress. \n\nThe city, once a tiny nomadic village, is now surrounded by barbed wire and tall, jagged fences and walls that keep both enemies out and its occupants within. Each post connecting the interlock wall sections is adorned with the severed head or dismembered limbs of those foolish to ride against the new Khan, and each surface is adorned with the hides of Mongolia’s foes - their skins stretched taught and strained to cover the exposed surfaces of the perimeter walls like goat skin over a drum. Past these flesh-covered metal and wooden barricades lies a sea of gers and yurts, small hovels, and a few larger permanent structures dotted across the expanse of tents like a small archipelago amid a sea of lean-tos and nomadic structures. \n\nIn the center of this sprawl stands the central fortress of Ja Lama himself - a large, walled and equally grotesquely decorated compound where Ja Lama’s personal ger stood as well as the homes of those closest to him in his retinue. In his massive central tent, adorned with the draped and dried skins of hundreds of his foes, dozens of concubines lavished their liege and pranced about as Ja Lama sat and smoked opium in front of the fire. The walls of his ger were adorned with the pelts, skins, and trophies of his most favored prey, man or beast, as well as his large collection of weapons and firearms. In any available open floor space, piles of plunder and treasure sat stacked in meter-high mounds, and smoke from his hearth and his opium pipe filled the room with a smoky haze. This central home stood as the black heart of Ja Lama’s khanate, and from this grisly decorated hold, he rules over all Mongolia."

mon.450.t:0 "The Peculiarities of a God"
mon.450.d:0 "The origins and particulars of Ja Lama have long been shrouded in mystery, largely due to the great effort he goes to in order to obscure his true nature and identity. Across Mongolia and East Asia, reports claim that the man once called Dambijantsan was born in China, either Inner or Outer Mongolia, Kalmykia, or even Shambhala itself, with Ja Lama never giving a solid and consistent answer. How he came to be revealed as a tulku and who elevated him to the position of Lama has never been solidly deduced, and even particulars about when either he or his son were born continue to elude both his allies and the wider public. As always, Ja Lama proves to be an unsolvable enigma, and yet now rules all of Mongolia, for better or for worse. \n\nMysteries about his origins are not the only questions or doubts that have been raised against this living folktale, for this legend among men also claims to hold a myriad of powers and abilities. A fierce practitioner of ‘gun magic’, it is said that Ja Lama could cure the ailment of any many by simply focusing on the disease and firing his trusty rifle in the patient’s general direction. Additionally, he has been reported to carve Tibetan letters and runes into his bullets, granting them divine accuracy and magical properties unfathomable to an ordinary human mind. On top of his dabbling in the arts of gun magic, it is said he is immune to bullets, able to read minds, invincible and invulnerable to any Earthly force, ageless and timeless without withering or decay, and able to conjure the powers and abilities of the Buddhist deity Mahakala itself - these fantastical abilities are just a few of the powers and magics ever-ready and at the disposal of the great Ja Lama, or so he and his supporters vehemently claim. These powerful abilities make Ja Lama a practical legend and demigod in the eyes of many, while to others he just comes across as a conman or a lying fool. However, these naysayers are never around or loud for long about their complaints or doubts, for the eyes and ears of Ja Lama are everywhere, and none shall doubt his powers! And who are they to doubt these clearly true claims? These tales, bizarre as they may seem, when told by the light of a campfire, deep in the Gobi eighty miles from any other human beings, are not so easily dismissed, and they are all the more undeniable when one of Ja Lama’s men has a rifle aimed square in the eye."

mon.451.d:0 "One of the largest aspects of Ja Lama’s ever-shifting and unknowable identity is his supposed lineage. Long has he claimed to be the great-grandson and reincarnation of Amursana. In the 18th century, Amursana was an Oirat taishi, or prince, who led a righteous revolt against the Qing in hopes of freeing the Mongolic peoples of Dzungaria and Altishahr. Instead of victory however, Amursana was cut down and his people, our people, were slaughtered en masse in what has since been called the Dzungar Genocide. Since this fatal loss, the Chinese have subjugated and oppressed our people, and now centuries have passed under this harsh reality. \n\nWith the ascendance of Ja Lama however, all that can finally change. As the reincarnation and blood descendent of Amursana, many in our nation are confident that he is the prince that has been promised in prophecy and White Faith, and Ja Lama uses this faith to his advantage as he rules over all of Mongolia. It is not known if he truly is what he says he is, or if he even truly believes it himself, but he has gone so far as to name his own son after the famed hero, and has seemingly dedicated his entire life to living in Amursana’s image. Whatever the case or reality may be, Ja Lama is the closest thing we have to the fabled last hero of the Oirats, and under his guidance, maybe the Mongolic peoples can finally be truly free."

With his power proving supreme over all others in Mongolia and from his elevated position in the spiritual hierarchy of our Buddhist church, Ja Lama has revealed to the people of Mongolia his ‘true’ identity. Claiming to be the physical embodiment and avatar of Mahākāla, the Buddhist God of Time, Maya, Creation, Destruction, and Power, Ja Lama has heralded the revival of the Dzungar Khanate and declared that Mongolia shall be the heartland of a newly restored Oirat nation. With this declaration, he has recited to his nation in a national broadcast a poem he wrote of such an event: \n\n’I am a mendicant monk from the Russian Tsar's kingdom, but I am born of the great Mongols. My herds are on the Volga river, my water source is the Irtysh. There are many hero warriors with me. I have many riches. Now I have come to meet with you beggars, you remnants of the Oirats, in the time when the war for power begins. Will you support the enemy? My homeland is Altai, Irtysh, Khobuk-sari, Emil, Bortala, Ili, and Alatai. This is the Oirat mother country. By descent, I am the great-grandson of Amursana, the reincarnation of Mahākāla, owning the horse Maralbashi. I am he whom they call the hero Dambijantsan. I came to move my pastures back to my own land, to collect my subject households and bondservants, to give favour, and to move freely. \n\nWith these words, Ja Lama, Avatar of Mahakala and Heir to Amursana, has declared war against modernity and time itself, for from the pages of history and myth and into reality he has revived the dreams of a free Oirat nation. May all the enemies of the Mongolic peoples live in fear and horror, for the God of the Steppe is coming for all who still infect our rightful lands and oppress our kin."

However, none have ever been able to verify where or when he acquired this title and how he came to learn he was a true tulku, or reincarnating custodian of a pure Buddhist soul. Supposedly raised and taught by a lower lama as a boy and raised in the Gelug school long before coming to Mongolia, Ja Lama is the claimed reincarnation of Amursana - a fact never substantiated in any official capacity by other tulkus or priests. Though his claims are wild, this does not mean he is a mere pretender.

In a flash, Ja Lama’s retinue descended upon the settlement, and after a bloody cacophony of horrific screams and clashing steel, yet another Gamin village fell to the might of Ja Lama. With their soldiers, some still barely alive, skinned and flayed as their bodies were dismembered and refigured into grotesque shapes and effigies, the stench of death began to spread throughout the still-burning ruins. While some soldiers continued to make their grisly art of flesh and tissue, others raided the few structures left standing and salvaged them for all valuables and plunder. Like vultures or jackals picking over a carcass, Ja Lama’s men ripped through every last pile of debris and corpses, looting anything of value and claiming the skins of the most ferocious enemy combatants. \n\nAfter their haul was complete and their loot sacks filled, these dark riders took flight once more across the prairie back to the lands of their own, carrying with them the next round of plunder that would fuel Mongolia’s economy and desires until the next round of riders returned. Like clockwork, hordes under Ja Lama’s command repeated this horrific routine, day in and day out, carrying with them the future of Mongolia with each haul. "

The always independent and stubborn Bogd Gegen must be silenced so that Ja Lama’s hold over all of Mongolia can be complete, but to kill a god is no easy task. \n\nIn the quiet of night, agents of Ja Lama shall poison the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in his sleep, and with this act, their final plan to secure Mongolia’s future shall be put into motion. With the old fool out of the way, all attention shall be diverted to finding his reincarnated replacement, the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. Once this infant is found, Ja Lama and his retinue seek to mold the child to their own will and ideas, effectively puppeting the spiritual leader of Mongolia and their people’s one true link to the gods. This child shall be indoctrinated in both the ideas of Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith, cementing our new religion’s importance within Mongolian society and granting it divine legitimacy from our link to the Buddha himself. None in Mongolia may learn of the true and dark deeds we will have committed to get us to this moment though, so utmost secrecy must be assured.

Inside the confines of his own domain, among the people he works so hard to protect, the hard facade of a crazed killer melts away. A fan of leisure and of relaxation, he is frequently spotted near swimming holes or in eateries, relaxing the day away as he enjoys the fineries of life. Smoking opium has long been a passtime of his, but so has volunteering for the local Buddhist monasteries and entertaining the local children while their parents work their fields or earn their livings. This stark dichotomy shocks many who do not know the true nature of Ja Lama. Though he may be a bloodthirsty warlord who flays his enemies alive, he does so for the good of his people. If it were not for these human connections he keeps with his own kin and countrymen, he would be nothing but a beast."

The Dzungar Genocide has been avenged and now our people can roam the Steppe peacefully as their ancestors once did, without fear of death or foreign encroachment. \n\nNow that our new Khanate has risen from the ashes and this pastoralist ideal has been returned to our lands, we must decide on a new banner for our resurgent horde, and before us we have a few options."

As he and his forces remove the Chinese filth and the scars they have left upon our land, our clergymen and monks have been busy proliferating a new syncretic faith to help guide our newly freed people. \n\nBeing called the ‘Red Faith’ by many of its practitioners, this new pantheon is partially based on Gada Meirien’s own shamanistic beliefs mixed with Karma Kagyu Buddhism, Tengri, and even some Socialist principles based on the ideas of the Mongol Ardīn Nam. Though it still pales in comparison to the popularity of pure Gelug Buddhism, this new syncretic religion has already outpaced the vile Chinese belief systems, becoming the second most prominent unified faith in Mongolia."

A beautiful and once-pristine grassland that stretched for hundreds of miles and filled with nomadic idealism has now been turned into a hive of Chinese settlement that scars the land and their massive agricultural initiatives that eat away at the once flowing and unbroken seas of long grass that swayed endlessly in these lands. \n\nNestled at the heart of this flowing grasslands is the once wild and free homeland of Gada Meiren himself, in the village of Jam-Un Tokhui where he was born as Nadmid of the Mültütü clan. Once a small, traditional hub for nomadic clans and Mongolian settlers to live in peace while intertwined with their own culture, now an abomination stands in its place. Massive fields of oats and millet crops now stretch over the once verdant prairie, and where traditional gers and yurts once stood, made from animal skins and timber, now stands large Chinese housing complexes of mortar and stone, imposing and permanent new marks that sully this great paradise that is the Mongolian wilderness. These structures and fields stand as an affront to the very Mongolian way of life! The fools that work these lands are nothing more than mindless parasitic drones raping the natural bounty of our land as they make profit for their masters and breed like vermin in an attempt to suffocate the Monglian people in their own lands. However, with the return of Gada Meiren to his ancestral home, this perversion shall finally be brought to an end. This Banner, once his home, shall be razed to the ground, and by the sword and bow of his riders, every Han settler shall be cut down and laid to rot in the Mongolian sun as their structures are torn to the ground and their fields are burned and salted. Only then shall these rats have finally provided something of use to our people, for their blood and bones shall feed the next generation of grasslands that regrow over this accursed settlement. \n\nOnce this dark but all too necessary deed is complete, Gada Meiren’s horde will ride off to yet another Han encampment and repeat this process once more, until all of the Khorchin plains and all of Mongolia are free and repaid for the hardships we have endured."

mon.459.d:0 "In traditional Buddhist thought, particularly in the ancient Nyingma school that has attracted much interest from Gada Meiren, there exists certain hidden valleys and rifts in this world called Beyuls - physical manifestations of Buddhist purity and Shambhala on Earth in the form of verdant and pure natural paradises tucked away from the world and protected by a powerful guardian deity. Already have examples of these paradises been discovered today, proving the righteousness of our faith. In Tibet, great fissures hidden in the Himalayas like Barun Valley and Puyol offer pristine slices of practical Eden long isolated and preserved from the horrors of Man’s world. In Mongolia itself, similar sites exist in the form of the Ten Sacred Mountains of Mongolia: ten centers of Buddhist serenity and naturalistic purity dotted across the expanse of our nation. However, with Gada Meiren’s efforts to restore the true Mongolian pastoralist ideal and natural beauty that our nation has been blessed with, a new idea has begun to form within the ranks of lamas, other tulkus, and monks within our clergy. /n/nThese zealots have begun to see Gada Meiren himself as a dharmapāla of a newly forming Mongolian Beyul. As the dharmapāla, or a vengeful Buddhist warrior deity of wrath tasked with the protection of holy lands, law, and justice, Gada Meiren is said to be the herald of a new Buddhist golden age in Mongolia. As his war against the foreign forces that plague Mongolia continues and as he spreads both his Red Faith and the established Buddhist schools of Gelug and Nyingma, the Steppe is only made more pure and verdant. Soon, all of Mongolia shall be one large and protected Beyul, with Gada Meiren as its holy guardian."
mon.459.a:0 "A slice of Shambhala here on the Steppe, under the watchful protection of our Dharmapāla."

mon.460.t:0 "The Red Nomads of the Eastern Steppe"
mon.460.d:0 "With his cooperation with the Mongol Ardīn Nam and various other leftist and liberal revolutionary groups, many have begun to see Gada Meiren as not only a champion of the Mongol people and anti-imperialism, but also as a true ally of the proletarian struggle itself. Though it is largely unknown if our hero holds any of these egalitarian and Socialist views himself, it is widely known that he at least is a true champion of the Mongolian people and seeks to see all his people prosper, and this uncertainty has not stopped the MAN from pushing this agenda to the wider nation. \n\nLabeling it as a form of ‘Red Nomadism’, the Mongol Ardīn Nam have begun to influence the younger generations of nomads and riders that still roam the Steppe and the wider Mongolian wilderness. Fusing traditional Mongolia ideals and culture with modern Socialist views, this new strain resembles some Western ideas of anarchism or communalism, without much of the useless theory that has gone into those less forms of living. Our nomadic and commune-like society is not born out of mere fantasy or the ideas of pampered Western nobles - it is instead forged in our own histories and experiences; a proven legacy that has endured for millenia and a way of life that has endured while lesser civilizations have been lost to history. \n\nThese ideas have already become immensely popular with many of the young soldiers that have fallen in with Gada Meiren’s horde, and as he spreads purity across Mongolia, so too does he spread this new school of thought, whether he means to or not. Red Nomadism is the only true future for Mongolia, and Gada Meiren will be the instrument of its proliferation."
mon.460.a:0 "A perfect fusion of tradition and progress."

mon.461.t:0 "Kindred Spirits United Under One Struggle"
mon.461.d:0 "Though Gada Meiren is a man of rare stock and rarer heroics, he is not the only legend of his kind fighting a noble war against the foreign parasites that infest Mongolia’s pristine wilderness. Another hero of the Mongolian people patrols the Korchin grasslands, laying waste to both Russian colonists and Han settlers alike in a holy and righteous crusade against imperialism. However, unlike Gada Meiren, a man of low-birth and humble beginnings, his counterpart is no mere nomad or peasant. \n\n Yangsanjab, Prince Öndür, Favored Son of the Borjigin Clan, and Descendant of Hasar, brother of Temüjin himself, is one of the most honored and revered nobles in all of Mongolia. Even before taking up his current exploits, he has been held in high regards by both the former Qing lords that oppressed Mongolia’s people and the Mongolia people themselves, who have long viewed Yangsanjab as one of the more honorable princes in the Yazgurtan Survaljtan. This adoration is both due to his own heroic and noble actions and his high spiritual significance, being a disciple of the Janggiya Khutuktu and a close friend of the 9th Panchen Lama, and as such has risen to be a popular face of the Mongolian nobility. Now, this high level of reverence has been even further elevated, for this proud noble has proven himself time and time again to be a true ally of the Mongolian people, for like Gada Meiren, Yangsanjab has led his own horde of freedom fighters and insurgents against the Han and Russian colonialists, serving valiantly in the wider flight to uproot this foreign presence in Mongolia for good. \n\nThough in theory, these two forces would be opposed to one another, at least ideologically, for one stands as a rich and proud noble while the other stands as a revolutionary, things could not be further from the truth. Despite these surface level differences, these two forces of nature and Mongolia fury have miraculously become fast friends and comrades, with their hordes frequently coopertting as they mercilessly slaughter the Han and salt their fields for the good of all Mongolians. With these two avatars of the Mongol spirit, our people can rest easy, for Mongolia truly is safe as long as heroes like these patrol the Steppe."
mon.461.a:0 "Together, we shall raise hell and slay these foreign parasites, for all Mongolians!"

mon.462.t:0 "The Red Niō of Mongolia"
mon.462.d:0 "With Mongolia largely secured and the foreign leeches that once drained our nation’s greatness now finally cast out or put down, the hero of Mongolia Gada Meiren has vanished from the public eye just as quickly as he appeared, stunning the clique of Mongol Ardīn Nam associates he had been cooperating with for some time to free Mongolia. Leaving nothing but a short note scrapped on a parchment and stuck to the table with a knife, this spirit of the Steppe has disappeared without a trace. \n\nIn his absence, his instructions to the MAN are clear: Gada Meiren is to stay as the de-facto leader of Mongolia, and as the face of the nation and its government, with his absences being largely kept hidden from the people. In his stead, the MAN is to work with the Bogd Khan to continue his work in purifying and safeguarding Mongolia from any outside threat while working to uplift any and all true Mongolians within our borders. Under this arrangement, the MAN would rule as a sort of shadow-government behind the facade of Gada Meiren’s absolute political authority and under the spiritual and moral guidance of the Bogd Khan. This system shall ensure Mongolia’s continued stability and safety as it progresses towards a truly egalitarian, ‘Red Nomadic’ state. \n\nIn the meantime, as these politicians and monks take the reins of rule, the savior of all Mongolia has returned to the lands of his people in secret, out in the far East of Mongolia’s prairie. Here, he rides with his wife Mudan and their children and the people of their clan in peace, continuing their idealistic life now free of foreign encroachment and banditry. If his people ever need him again, he shall ride forth once more, for he is the Red Niō of Mongolia - its protector and guardian, just as the Niō of legend guard the enlightened Buddha himself. As he rides across the grasslands of his birth once more a free man, may all of Mongolia sing praises of his name, for this Last Son of Khorchin is the true savior of Modern Mongolia, and the greatest Mongol to ride since Genghis Khan himself. Our nation and our people shall forever be in his debt, and may we never be in such a dire position to require his aid again.

It is the destiny of China and the Han people to not only subjugate these lands, but to completely and utterly erase every last facet of the Mongol identity from existence. Our pure race is in a perfect position to be able to do this necessary act, and we have just the way to do so without bloodshed. Copying a tactic of the Chinese people that has persisted for centuries, we shall use our massive numbers to our advantage by genetically assimilating the Mongol race. \n\nThrough a series of forced sterilizations, state-enforced miscegenation quotas, population fracturing, and other forms of population control, we shall totally Sinify the Mongolian people, wiping not only their culture, but their very genes from this planet and replacing it with the pure, righteous Han Chinese identity. ‘Mongolia’ as a concept will be a thing of the past within a few short generations as we make the Steppe truly Chinese."

mon.464.d:0 "To earn our independence and force the Chinese to make good on their deal for autonomy, the Mongolian people must serve as the frontline forces for the coming crusade to retake Beijing. The various nomads and riders of the Steppe and the Gobi have been conscripted to form elite Kheshig cavalry divisions centered around protecting the leaders and generals of the Anfu Club in the heat of battle, while also serving as an elite fast-attack strikeforce and vanguard brigade. Complementing these noble riders and joining them in battle are the numerous masses of arats, or Mongolian peasants, that shall stand together as barely organized rabble serving as a meatshield against the Chinese hordes we are sure to face on the march to Beijing. Though many of these poor, innocent farmers and herders will be brutal cut down, joining the river of blood that flows along these plains with every battle, but so too shall the blood of our enemies join the mix. Without fighting, we will never earn our independence, and fighting, conquest, and war itself is in the very blood of our people.

The Anfu Club has plotted to do the unthinkable - to shackle a god to their own will. The Bogd Gegen is weak and ageing fast, nearly dying in 1924 due to a supposed botched assassination attempt by the MAN. His weak position and vulnerability give us a unique opportunity to bind him to our very will. By threatening his life, the life of his beloved wife, and the life of his people, we can enslave this god amongst men to our will, shackling an entire faith to whims of our regime. \n\nAlternatively, we can simply poison this fool, and instead begin the search for the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. However, instead of looking in Mongolia or Tibet, we know that the next Bogd Gegen shall of course be of Han blood, for it is what the stars and the gods dictate to be true! With a truly Chinese Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the Gelug Bhuddist faith shall forever be tied to China."

mon.466.d:0 "With our government finally beginning the Russification of Mongolia in earnest, one of more controversial questions of Russification has finally reared it's ugly head. That question of course being what to do in regards to the spiritual lives of the Mongolian people. While of course our own colonization efforts have indeed begun to bring the light of Christ and His most holy bride the Church to these forsaken lands, those who adhere to the One True Faith still make up a tiny fraction our total population.\n\nThis being the case, an intense debate has broken out within the halls of power on just what to do with in this regard. On one side lies the more hardline within our administration. They wish to see Mongolia turned into a truly Christian land, free from the stain of paganism. They plan to accomplish this viva the use of both increased missionary work and the use of force. One such target of force would be the Bogh Khan, he would be forced to either convert or meet his maker.\n\nThe other side of this debate lies those who wish for a more moderate approach. While they agree that Mongolia must be an Orthodox Christian nation, they believe that only by working with the local religion, the local myths, can we hope to truly bring Mongolia into the faith. While this method would indeed bring about a unique form of Mongolian Orthodoxy, it would also take much longer, a downside none can refute.\n\nBesides these two options, another does in fact exist. That option, of course, simply being to ignore the question. We have only just begun Russification, the question of religion can wait. Regardless, the choice falls to the wise [MON.GetLeader] to make."

Often depicted as having seven eyes, with two normal eyes, one on the forehead, and one more on each of her hands and feet, this all-seeing goddess of infinite wisdom and compassion is seen to embody the very essence of a true Russian ruler, with the tradition starting in 1764 under the rule of Catherine II. For centuries since, devout Russia Buddhists revered the Tsars as this embodiment, but with Russia’s collapse during their Civil War and with the rise of the Mad Baron, this was all thrown into chaos. \n\nWith Mongolia’s allegiance once more turning to Moscow and the true Russian leader, once more we have decided to hold the traditional ceremony to proclaim their leader, [RUS.getleader], the true embodiment of the White Tara. In an opulent and extravagant ceremony presided over by the highest lamas and tulkus in Mongolia and with hundreds of monks spread out before them, bowing to their grace, [RUS.getleader] has been dubbed the Avatar of the White Tara and has been spiritually enshrined on the Throne of the White Goddess. Now, the one, true leader of Russian Buddhism has taken their rightful spot within the Buddhist hierarchy. May all pious souls rejoice!"

The first plan, based on the namesake and original esoteric aims of the founding Soyombo Revival Society, seeks to replace the Mongol script, known as Qudum Mongγol Bičig, and the Tibetan abugida script with the Soyombo script of Zanabazar as the main writing system of the Buddhist monasteries and their texts and clergy. While this is done, the second plan calls for the laity of Mongolia to abandon the Qudum Mongγol Bičig as well and replace it with a Cyrillic-based alphabetic transliteration of Mongolian.

The esoteric spiritualists and intellectuals who seek to search for the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu after the passing of his predecessor, preferably ‘finding’ him in Russian-dominated Oirat or Altaic lands and forging him as a puppet to our unique, syncretic spiritual connection to both Buddhism and Russian Orthodoxy. On the opposing side, the Ungern loyalists and other Russian military men instead seek to simply murder this old, half-blind fool and end the cycle for good, severing the Mongolian’s connection to their faith without going through the SRS’s sanctioned clergy. The SRS has already heavily slander the Bogd Gegen, calling him a paedophile, a zoophile, an inbred dimwit, and libertine, among many other baseless accusations, and so his reputation in the public eye is already not the best.

##########INTRO Events
mon.600.t:0 "The Mad Baron’s Domain"
mon.600.d:0 "In 1936, Ungern’s rule remains under threat. There are four main cliques that dominate Mongolian political society.\n\nThe Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika are a clique of White Russian officers under the leadership of Ungern-Sternberg. They focus on cooperation with Russia, military strength and anti-socialism. They currently lead the country, working with the Yazgurtan Survaljtan and the Buddyn Zövlöl.\nThe Yazgurtan Survaljtan is the name of the hierarchy of Mongolian princes and nobles, who had been the ruling class of the country for centuries. Focusing on keeping their wealth and power secure, they are larelgely led by the Inner Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub, who leads a  domineering and ambitious group of Inner Mongolian Princes centered around the region of Xilingol.\nThe Buddyn Zövlöl are a council of high ranking buddhists lamas, tulkus, and monks in Mongolia, which was formed following Ungern’s purge of lamas in 1930. Many members of the council are fanatic buddhists, who wish to turn Mongolia into a truly theocratic society under the Bogd Khan. They are led by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, a high ranking lama from Inner Mongolia.\nThe Mongol Ardīn Nam, the socialist party who rebelled in 1921 and 1924 remain in hiding, but are still a strong force to be reckoned with. Led by Soliin Danzan and receiving aid from various other Mongolian democratic parties and even the famed Gada Meiren, they have taken some inspiration from Russia and Chinese democratic regimes, and therefore have begun advocating for multiparty democracy under their control.\n\nAside from these main political cliques, the bandit lord and warrior tulku Ja Lama rules from his bandit fortress in Khovd, seeking to restore ancient glories and vengeance against the Chinese. Foreigners besiege our Khanate as well, for the Soyombo Revival Society has once again begun to rise to national prominence, advocating for the transformation of Mongolia into a Russian colonial satellite. Their main opposition comes in the form of the Anfu Club, remnants of the disgraced Anhui Clique that fled to Mongolia following the disastrous Northern Expedition and now seek to use Mongolia as the launching point of their crusade to Beijing. \n\nAs if our inner-politics could not get more hectic, Mongolia also faces many external threats. For many years, border skirmishes have taken place between the Muslim Chinese Ma Clique and Mongolian troops across the border. A similar situation is taking place in the Dzungaria region of the Xinjiang Clique. The main point of tension is the province of Yushu, which has swapped hands between Tibet and the Ma Clique over the past few years. The province is a powderkeg waiting to explode, and when it does, the opportunity to unite the Mongolian people cannot be ignored. Mongolia sits on the edge of an uncertain future, and it is up to the Mad Baron to steer this unsteady ship in the right direction, lest the whole rotten structure collapse and the various internal forces that assail his regime tear our nation apart."

## Shared Orothdox Event

mon.658.t:0 "Of Buddha and Josaphat"
mon.658.d:0 "In Medieval Europe, one of the most popular folktales of the Saints was that of Barlaam and Josaphat. In the short, the legend tells the story of an Indian prince who, despite his father's hatred and persecution of the Christian faith, ends up converting thanks to the wise guidance of the mystic Barlaam, a hermit. After a time, his father also converts to the Christian religion, after which he abdicates the throne to Josaphat to live as a hermit. Josaphat, like his father before him, abdicates the throne and goes on to live a life of piety, performing miracles and converting souls with his teacher Barlaam before his death.\n\nToo modern scholars, especially those who study Buddhism, the story of Barlaam and Josaphat is little more then a 'baptism' of one of the many stories regarding the Buddha and his life. While this fact is usually of little consequence, with our government beginning to sponsor the Orthodox Church within Mongolia, many wonder if this ancient story could become a boon to our attempts at converting this land.\n\nThose who support using the legend for our own benefit fall into two camps. The first, made up mostly of the rank and file of the SRS, believe we should use our new found connections with the Church to have Saint Josaphat be formally declared both the Patron of Mongolia.  But more then that, declare he is the actual Buddha, and that stories that he was the founder of Buddhism are later fabrications. While such an action would require quite a bit of push on our end for the Church to agree to it, it would also greatly increase our efforts at converting Mongolia.\n\n The second camp, mostly made up of die-hard loyalists of the Mad Baron, call for a much more radical approach. This second camp wishes for us to in essence fully embrace the idea that Josaphat is Buddha, but not in an Orthodox context. Instead, they wish for us to slowly start phasing out use of Buddha from the Mongolian mind, replaced with St. Josaphat. By doing this, they believe, we will slowly the complete synchronization of Buddhism and Orthodox Christianity. While such a proposal is obviously abhorrent to any true Christian, to the followers of the Mad Baron, it is simply recognizing the truth of Divinity present in all forms of Religion.\n\nWhile both ideas are radical in their own right, [MON.GetLeader] could simply elect to ignore them. After all, would need do we have for causing even more religious unrest?"
mon.658.a:0 "Saint Josaphat, Pray for Us!"
mon.658.b:0 "Buddha is Josaphat and Josaphat is Buddha."
