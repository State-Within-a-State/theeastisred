revolutionary_khmerism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Revolutionary Khmerism)§!\n\nRevolutionary Khmerism is an ultra-leftwing ideology that is based of principles of Khmer nationalism and revolutionary agrarianism.  Revolutionary Khmerism(aka Rev. Khmer)is very nationalistic and patriotic and thinks that communism can make Cambodia great again, like in the good ol' Khmer Empire days. It seeks betterment of the peasants and promotes an agrarian society that is extremely hostile to the petty bourgeoisie, tho also having some resentment to urbanism in some noted ideological recordings. Rev. Khmer denotes the emphasis on a national cultural revolution in which the masses destroy reactionary culture in its entirety. Another main point sticks from the fact that its ideological founders are highly egalitarian tho also harbor anti-vietnamese sentiment."
