revolutionary_khmerism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Revolutionary Khmerism)§!\n\nRevolutionary Khmerism is an ultra-leftwing ideology that is based of principles of Khmer nationalism and revolutionary agrarianism.  Revolutionary Khmerism(aka Rev. Khmer)is very nationalistic and patriotic and thinks that communism can make Cambodia great again, like in the good ol' Khmer Empire days. It seeks betterment of the peasants and promotes an agrarian society that is extremely hostile to the petty bourgeoisie, tho also having some resentment to urbanism in some noted ideological recordings. Rev. Khmer denotes the emphasis on a national cultural revolution in which the masses destroy reactionary culture in its entirety. Another main point sticks from the fact that its ideological founders are highly egalitarian tho also harbor anti-vietnamese sentiment."

###Events###
cambodia_civilwar.0.desc:0 "As we secure our independence, the indochinese syndicalists have started to spread uprisings into our lands. The Khmer Issarak has been formed and now causes havoc for our troops. We are now in a state of civil war, as we defend ourselves internally and externally from the syndicalist threat at hand. We shall fight on for a new Cambodia."
cambodia_civilwar.1.desc:0 "As we gain a decisive victory over the Issarak, we now push them out of their siege positions and back into the jungle. As we push, the army command looks at what to do next.Shall we finish just the issarak or strike the mastermind, the Indochinese syndicalists. As we secure the country, we will crush our enemies as if they are fragile eggs."
cambodia_civilwar.2.desc:0 "Finally, we have defeated them. We have stopped the insurgency and agreed to meet with them for their surrender to us. As the country celebrates, we allow the majority of the Issarak forces to join the government, integrate into civilian life and to also allow them to join our army. Finally we have secured the country and the civil war is over. But not so fast. We still deal with Champa ethnic uprisings and splinter issarak forces. But no need to worry, our military shall crush them."
cambodia_civilwar.3.desc:0 "Huzzah! We have liberated Siam and also the Cambodians trapped inside of it. Now as we embark on further uniting the khmer people and marching further than our small borders. We shall honor the legacy of the Khmer Empire of ancient times and make a great international standing for Cambodia. Now we face the decisions of puppeting Siam as revenge for their past or to take their lands & independence from them as they did to us."
cambodia.0.desc:0 "Sadness!!! Our King has been shot!\nWhilst sleeping in his bed at night, the king would be disturbed by a royal guard entering his room. The guard doesn’t answer and walks to him. The king yells for his guards but it's too late, the guard stabs him 42 times. This person was an issarak spy. He is quickly arrested and the regency orders him to be executed.  Now his heir Sihanouk rises to the throne."
cambodia.1.desc:0 "After our victory in the civil war and loss of our former king, the country awaits the actions of the government to decide on what to do for the future. This involves the re-organization of the country in which republicans and the military fight it out. The republicans are wanting an abolishment of the monarchy and establishment of a true democratic republic. Whilst the military prefer either an ultra-nationalist oligarchic republic or at least a monarchist state with the king as head of state. Each side wants a better future for Cambodia in a way that suits them."
cambodia.2.desc:0 "As per issue of the regency, comes the question of the power of Cambodia’s No.1 General Lon Nol, a figure that has beliefs in strange practices who was chosen to lead the military after his success defeating the Issarak forces. After the King’s death many worry about Sihanouk being too young for the throne and insist he become regent for the young king. On the other hand republicans see this as a power grab by him and the military in order to legitimize Lon Nol’s claim to national leadership."
cambodia_power.0.desc:0 "The constitution becomes another major point of contention as per the regency issue, since it is the military wanting more influence in the constitution making rather than unbiased law makers. Same can be said for the republicans as they seek to remove any sort of pro-monarchist ideas being placed in the constitution, not to mention using the document to further limit army powers."
cambodia_power.1.desc:0 "In what was mentioned about the constitutional issues, the republicans are wanting to eliminate the majority of the army influence throughout the country and restore law and order through mainly peaceful means, this though is countered by the military, arguing that by doing such things that the country will fall into chaos. Hence trying to justify that the military needs more powers in order to curb any chaos that occurs."
cambodia_power.2.desc:0 "Yet again another snag in this nation’s making. The republicans and the militarists are arguing over the use of democratic rights. The republicans mainly supported using democracy to allow better freedoms to the Cambodian people, whilst the army want to remove it and save democracy for another day. This issue is by far the most contentious as fist fights break otu of the parliament floor."
cambodia_power.3.desc:0 "Now as the final days of the constitution congress finishes up, the final results shall be delivered on who shall rule Cambodia. With many concerned about the violence during and after this period. The results say…."
cambodia_republic.0.desc:0 "As we secure our rights for a new republic, we shall have our first election to determine who shall lead us to full democracy. After the purge of Lon Nol, we have managed to secure the army and place our loyalists in charge. First candidate is the KPNLF which is a social liberal party that aims to make Cambodia a liberal nation or support the theory of Sangkum, with mixes of state capitalism and a welfare state. Next is Son Ngoc Thanh’s party which is conservative and is pro japanese. It is concerning for him to be in power as he could make us submit to imperialists again. Finally is the democratic party. The democratic party is a socialist party formed from anti-issarak socialists, this include a relative of the former king, who wants to make Cambodia into a socialist kingdom whilst denouncing Sangkum. With Ieu Koeus being the Democratic Socialist wing leader and wanting to make Cambodia a Democratic Socialist state."
cambodia_republic.1.desc:0 "After the success of our election, we now decide on the future of the leadership of the country under our party. Son Sann, is stuck between two roads of social liberalism and the social democratic Sangkum, whilst his opponent Penn Nouth promises a true Sangkum government."
cambodia_republic.2.desc:0 "After the victory of the democratic party in the elections, the party divides further as both sides of the party start to have differing ideas. Keous on one hand supports the continuation of a socialist republic and support for a proper democratic constitutional government, whilst Phurissara desires a socialist kingdom under the rule of him whilst still retaining most democratic principles. The party decides on what to do next."
cambodia_republic.3.desc:0 "As we succeed in our anti-monarchist dream, we question whether to kill the former king to force him into exile. By letting him live in exile, he could stir up sentiments against us, but if we kill him, we might lose some stability."
cambodia_republic.4.desc:0 "As the conflict grows, we need to see if it's wise to negotiate with the socialist rebels. But as we propose this the military proposes a continuation of the fight and to give the rebels no mercy. If we sign peace we save our country from more civil war, but we gain more of a syndicalist threat. By going after them, we can crush them for good, but destroy parts of our country in the process."
cambodia_revolution.0.desc:0 "The issarak has now made their official move toward the capital. We have been taken by surprise by this, but will be able to prepare for when they come. Yet we must slow them down. We must secure Mondulkiri first, defend the western regions and in case we need to, defend the capital of Strung Tung to the last man. We set up forts along with these areas and start training our troops for the fight for their lives."
cambodia_revolution.1.desc:0 "The first battle dawns.\nIssarak troops march from the south into Mondulkiri hoping to encircle our divisions. Intense fighting occurs with both sides taking heavy losses. But now we have a strategic advantage, Question is do we take this way or do we save ourselves from strategic defeat, in order to achieve national glory?"
cambodia_revolution.2.desc:0 "As they bypass Mondulkiri, they hit from the western regions, yet again more heavy fighting breaks out. They take the strategic advantage in terms of numbers and push forward into our lines. We can barely hold them much longer. We need to decide on what to do next."
cambodia_revolution.3.desc:0 "The final battle is the one to end it all. We shall defend the capital to the last cambodian! We shall fight on even if we are disabled! We shall fight on for our freedom! We have strong defenses and are taking heavy tolls on our enemies. But they start to gain some ground, we need to decide our next move. We are under siege and now we must break out before we starve to death."
cambodia_revolution.4.desc:0 "As the battle ends and the dust settles, the victor is…."
cambodia_revolution.5.desc:0 "Huzzah! We have liberated our comrades from the oppressive reactionary royal government and now set on securing our revolution for further strengthening of the Cambodian nation. Now they hide in the jungles. Now we social proclaim a true socialist Cambodia!"
cambodia_revolution.6.desc:0 "We have crushed them! Our defenses worked. We shall proclaim that we have saved Cambodia from the wretched socialists as we push them into the jungles where we can easily force them to surrender or annihilate them all. May we celebrate this day for years to come! Cambodia is free from syndicalist devilry!"
cambodia_revolution.7.desc:0 "As the night falls on the capital, Tou Samouth is fast asleep. Radicals of the Issarak raid his new home and execute him. A coup has started. Khieu Ponnary, a revolutionary legend and hero of the Issarak, has fallen to despise Tou Samouth. Now she seeks to implement her radical agrarian socialist reforms to transform Cambodia into a socialist utopia that is free from the evils of feudalism, capitalism and imperialism. The soldiers march in…"
cambodia_revolution.8.desc:0 "After the initial coup occurs, Khieu Ponnary arrives in Strung Tung to proclaim her victory of revisionism and reactionarism. She stands up on the podium and announces that in order to save the country that a large amount of the population must move to the country side in order to wait out the rebuilding of the capital and to improve farming production in order to stop the mass famine that had occurred due to the civil war and potential bombing by Vietnamese Monarchists (who were supplied with japanese planes)."
cambodia_revolution.9.desc:0 "The Reactionaries here under our custody shall meet their doom! Their blood shall never hurt another one of us proletarians again! We must purify the nation of capitalist-reactionary roaders and make sure they pay for the crimes they have committed."
cambodia_revolution.10.desc:0 "We have suffered enough from the bombings of the Vietnamese reactionaries! We have suffered enough under the Indochinese Union’s pro-vietnamese revisionist agenda, now we shall free ourselves with true Cambodian socialism. We shall show the world how we have liberated ourselves from both reactionary and revisionist oppression!"
cambodia_revolution.11.desc:0 "Now that we have cleared the city, we shall destroy the reaction buildings and culture and replace it with our own. This includes rebuilding the capital from the ground up. Long live our national cultural revolution!"
cambodia_revolution.12.desc:0 "For us the revolution is in full swing. We have been launched to a greater stage of agricultural production and revolutionary spirit. We still though are having issues with keeping the nation alive as we deal with issues caused by external forces. But now that we have started doing our policies, we can surely say that we shall be able to save Cambodia from death and destruction."
