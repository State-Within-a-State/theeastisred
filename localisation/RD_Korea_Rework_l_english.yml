korea_rising_dragon.0.title:0 "The Waves Crash Down on Joeson"
korea_rising_dragon.0.desc:0 "Decades have gone past since we have seen the light of freedom, we face the whip of oppression and the pain of the chains. The land of the Rising Sun has hit our shores and burns us with violent rays. From 1910, we were annexed by the Japanese Empire and made into a colony. Throughout the Great Weltkrieg we were forced to fight along side our overlords against the German imperialists. By 1919, we have become agitated, and sick of the ills of colonial rule. On May 4th 1919, with inspiration from the Chinese students & workers, our own students and workers, walked out and protested, demanding for Korean Indpendence. Though much like what happen in China, blood went flowing down the streets. Though it seem that the Japanese have slightly relaxed their rule, in light of the protests. But then 1923 hits the Empire. As the ground rumbles through Kanto, we here the screams echo through the gun shots at Pyeongyang. Radical army soldiers, blaming Koreans and westernization for the earthquake , brutally attacked and massacred us Koreans. Following this many Korea leftists left from France, there had been some who had joined the Russian Revolution of 1918, but would be driven into hiding and guerilla warfare in the far east and Manchuria. In 1925, a proper communist army was founded in Manchuria in tandem with Korea nationalists and Chinese socialists. Whilst other revolutionaries hide out in France and Asian socialist strongholds, working with syndicalist, communist and Kuomintang groups, with each developing radical views that they believe will save Korea. In 1929 to 1934 Korea had the moderate governor, Saitō Makoto, who was known for moderating Japanese colonial policies. Though this would last for 5 years as, seeing a failure of further expanding Korean integration into Japan, he would be replaced by who would be known as the "Tiger of Korea", Kuniaki Koiso, who'd impose quite harsh colonial policies. Its 1936 and Kuniaki Koiso is 2 years into his term and face still an increasing amount of Korean resistance, but also has managed to increase integration slightly more than Makoto. Yet this brings up a probability that he will be replaced, though who ever does it may set a large fire of this growing powder keg."

There will be tooltips displayed showing whether to increase or decrease Japanese influence.

From our spies and other sources, we can gather that this might reach a climax in a mass uprising in about 2-3 years time. We must inetrage the colony before they can have an ability to cause any major damage to our nation.\n\n§FKorean integration: [?JAP_KOR_INT]§!\n"
