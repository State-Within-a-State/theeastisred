KTG_Dominer_Pour_Servir:0 "Dominer pour Servir"
KTG_Dominer_Pour_Servir_desc:0 "'Rule so we can Serve'. These simple words define the colonial policy that the old Belgian government decreed in the Congo. The Congolese are our children and we have to raise and lift them so they too can enjoy the virtues of Western Progress. This is a slow proces and while it hopes to reward the Congolese in the end, colonial rule isn't supposed to disappear for many more years."
KTG_Restoration_Missions:0 "Restoration of the Missions"
KTG_Restoration_Missions_desc:0 "Due to aggressive German policies against the power of the catholic church, many of our mission posts have been abandoned. Now that we are back in control, our catholic associates are urging us to request new missionaries from Flanders-Wallonia so we can further develop our 'Dominer pour Servir' program."
KTG_Continue_Mission_To_Civilise:0 "Continue the Mission to Civilise"

KTG_Elections_Herminestadt:0 "Allow Free Elections in the Congo"
KTG_Elections_Herminestadt_desc:0 "The only way to consolidate power and satisfy our German overlords is to allow for free and fair elections within the colony. If we are truly a continuation of the Belgian state in Africa, we must appease our white middle class by letting them participate in local democracy."
KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap:0 "Abolish the Invisible Colour Gap"
KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap_desc:0 "While unlike the British or French colonies there never was a distinct colour gap in Congo, a glass ceiling blocked the Congolese from reaching high administrative or political positions. To combat the unrest that this has caused, the new progressive government has started efforts to break through these traditions and has started training the Evolués to replace some of the strictly European posts."

KTG_Limit_Native_Careers:0 "Limit Native Careers"

KTG_Educate_Native_Engineers:0 "Educate Native Engineers"
KTG_Educate_Native_Engineers_desc:0 "German reforms in the last decades have greatly changed the consciousness of the Katangese population.

KTG_Increase_Cobal_Production:0 "Increase the Cobalt Production"
KTG_Increase_Cobal_Production_desc:0 "With rising arms production around the world and the great importance of Cobalt for modern technology, the UMHK has decided to open three more mines around the city of Herminestadt to meet these demands and to further propel ourselves to become the prime exporter of this rare earth material."

KTG_Install_Farming_Quotas_desc:0 "To feed the growing urban populations of Bunkeya and Herminestadt, we have to impose strict farming quotas on the chefferies. These will then be collected by personnel of the colonial government in exchange for money and commodities and transfered to the cities."
KTG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers:0 "Centre Extra-Coutumiers"
KTG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers_desc:0 "While the system of Chefferies worked well in the past, the growing population and the questionable loyalty of the cheffs has pushed the government to create their own economic centres on the countryside. These will take over the task of the chefferies and will be the centre for legal, economic and social gathering."
KTG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies:0 "Monopolise Agricultural Companies"
KTG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies_desc:0 "Currently our agricultural industry constitutes of farming quotas implaced on the villages and the collection of these whenever the district manager passes by the village.

KTG_Technical_University_Herminestadt:0 "Technical University of Herminestadt"
KTG_Technical_University_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Due to the large growth of the UMHK over the last years, they have offered the government a large amount of funds to help in the creation of a technical university in Herminestadt.

KTG_Connect_Bunkeya_Herminestadt:0 "Electrify Bunkeya-Herminestadt"
KTG_Connect_Bunkeya_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Our two main cities are disconnected from each other making communication and transport very difficult. Therefore the railway Bunkeya-Herminestadt is to be expanded enabling larger amounts of both goods and people to use the line."
KTG_The_Colonial_Trinity:0 "The Colonial Trinity"

KTG_Patronisation_of_the_Natives:0 "Patronisation of the Natives"
KTG_Patronisation_of_the_Natives_desc:0 "The Congolese citizen is less developed than his European counterpart and needs careful assistance to guide them on his path.

KTG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life:0 "Control all Aspects of Modern Life"
KTG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life_desc:0 "The UMHK controls all aspects of its workers lives. They work in its mines, eat in its cantinas, buy their groceries in its stores.

KTG_Embrace_Congolese_Belgian_Culture_desc:0 "Herminestadt has grown to become a hub for both Flemish-Wallonians and Katangese who all live next to each other.

#Belgian-German recolonisation effort

ktg.20.t:0 "The mwami has seized control!"
ktg.20.d:0 "Just as the tax collectors were returning from the inland territories and the miners of the Union Minière were enjoying a well deserved peaceful Sunday afternoon, news arrived in the capital that the Mwami of the [ROOT.GetName] people had deposed the German governor, executed his associates and taken control over the province.\n\nWith most of the populace still unaware of these shocking developments and having relatively content relations with the Flemish-Wallonian administration, this comes as a huge shock to the colonials. For over 50 years, the word of the white man was law and every form of disobedience was punished severely. Now a native king of a small village has dared standing up to their command and taken power into his own hands.\n\nA friendly football competition between the Flemish-Wallonians and the Katangese was just underway when news hit the city of Herminestadt. At first the citizens can't believe what they are hearing and life continues as normal. In the Colonial headquarters, chaos has erupted with a split occuring between those that want to stay and fight to preserve that which they have built up for years and those that want to leave the continent as quickly as possible. The bishop of the city can been seen speaking with the head of Askari forces stationed in the city and Pierre Ryckmans, mayor of the city. Should they try and escape the country now that German rule has faltered or should they entrench themselves in the white quarter protected by the loyal Askari forces?"
ktg.20.a:0 "Order a mass evacuation of the colony!"
ktg.20.b:0 "The Flemish-Wallonian administration stays put."

ktg.21.t:0 "Alone on the Dark Continent"
ktg.21.d:0 "With Ryckmans giving the order to entrench in the city of Herminestadt, the Katangese population finally realised what was going on. While a certain part of the population see the rebellion and fall of German rule as their chance at liberation from European rule, the majority of the city's population is less convinced by the arguments of their brothers. While their life in the city has not been easy, many remember the days of their tribal past and the hardships those brought with them. European rule may have been fierce and often unjust, but with it came a certain degree of welfare that many no longer want to abandon and have thus rallied behind the banner of the colonial administration.\n\nTables, chairs, cupboards and more furniture is being dragged onto the streets establishing temporary barricades while citizens from the suburbs are being transferred to the city plaza. Arms and medical supplies, many of which dating back from the Belgian era, are being taken from the kazernes and beds are rolled into the Herminestadt hospital. While many of the men, women and children have no fighting experience, hundreds of young miners, factory workers and colonial employees are being forced to take up arms to defend their families and city from the Mwamis army. Out of a total population of around 45.000 citizens, 35.000 have barricaded themselves with the Flemish-Wallonian forces while the rest has fled the city and taken shelter in the nearby villages. Only small bands of seperatists now remain outside the fortified centre and are plundering and sacking the outskirts of the city, taking their revenge on the évolués and properties of the whites in preparation of the arrival of the Mwamis forces."
ktg.21.a:0 "A soft rain is setting in."

ktg.22.t:0 "Mwami forces approach the city"
ktg.22.d:0 "Three days have passed since the killing of the governor and the collapse of German rule and forces of the Mwami are marching on Herminestadt to once and for all destroy any remainder of Colonial rule. Many of the villages along the road to Herminestadt have already picked their sides and have either sworn loyalty or have been sacked by his forces. Village after village the Mwami approaches the capital, whites from all surrounding villages and labourers of the Flemish-Wallonian companies have travelled to the city seeking refuge behind its barricade. Word of the resistance has been sent to Flanders-Wallonia to inform them of the Mwamis march but with infrastructure in shammbles after the Collapse and roving parties roaming the Congo basin, it has become apparent that no European aid will arrive in time."
ktg.22.a:0 "Finalise all preparations."

ktg.23.t:0 "The siege begins"
ktg.23.d:0 "On the evening of the first week, the mwami has finally reached the city. With rain still pouring down as if God himself has opened the flood gates, life inside the fortifications is becoming tougher with the day.\n\nUnder cover of darkness a perimeter is established surrounding the city by the Mwami while scouting parties are sent inside the outskirts to investigate the fortifications made by the Colonials. While the mwami is outnumbered by the population of Herminestadt, his army consists of trained warriors and disgruntled veterans from the East-Afrika offensive while the defenders only have a small 1000 soldiers armed with Weltkrieg weapons from the Force Publique and a couple of European officers. To frigthen the defenders, the Mwami has commanded a thousand fires to be lit around the city and has initiated a war chant dating back from the Lunda war, to show the colonials that the Stairs Expedition will be avenged with fire and blood."
ktg.23.a:0 "Tighten the perimeter!"

ktg.24.t:0 "Battle for Herminestadt"
ktg.24.d:0 "At 8.00 the Mwami finally gives the signal citizens of Herminestadt have anxiously awaited during the night. Horns are sounded, shouting intensifies and the first charge commences. The assaulting force, numbering over 5000 trained warriors from his capital in Bunkeya, storm through the main avenue while deserted Askari warriors cover their attack."
ktg.24.a:0 "Fix bayonets! Repel them at all cost!"

ktg.25.t:0 "The Mwami falls back"
ktg.25.d:0 "For over 12 hours now, the battle for Herminestadt has been raging with heavy casualties on both sides forcing both parties to fall back for now and cut their losses. While the blockade at the north side of Kamalondo got overrun just after the morning, a concentrated effort of German machine guns, ex-soldiers of the Force Publique and an armed citizen militia was able to reconquer the point just before the evening, thus preventing a major breakthrough in the neighbourhood. While much of the Southern suburbs got overrun in the assault, with parts of the city set ablaze to cover the retreat, the fight did not provide the Mwami the decisive victory he desired and needed for the morale of his soldiers. Even though casualties are hard to estimate with certain parts of the city still in active combat, Ryckmans has estimated casualties on his side to number upwards of 3000. Casualties in the loyal Askari force were quite minimal but the loss of squads in the reconquest of Kamalondo are taking their toll on the already limited force."
ktg.25.a:0 "The future is looking bleak."

ktg.26.t:0 "The Assault recommences"
ktg.26.d:0 "Throughout the rest of the week, the Mwami furiously resumed his attacks on the city, each subsequent attack proving less effective than the last. Seeing the resolve of the Lubumbashi populace and the firm leadership by the Colonial administration, desertion has started to spread through the ranks of the Mwamin causing severe issues to his supply lines and the morale of the remaining warriors. At last the Mwami, sees no other solution than to offer a ceasefire to Pierre Ryckmans. Upon agreement, he offers the Colonials the right to retain their autonomy and power over the city of Herminestadt, control over the mines of the UMHK and a continuation of the pre-Collapse policy as long as he is allowed to rule the Yeke kingdom from his seat in Bunkeya as he pleases."
ktg.26.a:0 "Accept the Ceasefire."

ktg.27.t:0 "End of the siege"
ktg.27.d:0 "With the last of the Mwamis forces leaving the city, the devastation caused by the siege has finally become apparent. Hundreds of houses are burned down, streets are blockaded by debris and thousands of brave Congolese and colonials lay unburied on the battlefield. This fight may be won but the recovery has only just begun."
ktg.27.a:0 "Colonial order is restored!"

ktg.29.t:0 "Appointement of the new colonial governor"
ktg.29.d:0 "After the passing of the previous governor in the chaos of the Mittel-Afrikan collapse, a new governor has to be appointed to rule over the Katanga province. While the Mwami will remain as the official ruler, he will only be used as a titular chieftain while the real power is held by the Colonial office and the UMHK. Due to his steadfast leadership and dedication in the siege, Pierre Ryckmans has unanimously been elected by the Colonial administration until further elections can be held. Although Ryckmans has showed contrary to many of his predecessors that he cares about the native population, the Katangese citizens are worried that a continuation of the old Belgian colonial policy is on hands."
ktg.29.b:0 "Good Luck Pierre Ryckmans!"

ktg.28.t:0 "Riots of Herminestadt"
ktg.28.d:0 "With the Mwami approaching the city, many of the formerly loyal inhabitants see their chance at true independence free from White oppression. Mass rioting breaks out with houses of colonials being plundered and set ablaze. Greek and Italian restaurants and shops are being set alight and the overseers at UMHK decapitated on the streets."
ktg.28.a:0 "Katanga will be independent!"

#Flanders-Wallonia
ktg.40.t:0 "Envoy from Katanga"
ktg.40.d:0 "Through a vast communications network sustained by the catholic church in Congo, news has reached us over the situation of our former colony. Through clever use of the Force Publique and by utilising the population of Herminestadt, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans was able to hold on to colonial rule. Now, a formal request has been made by his government for support from our country. In the chaos that ensued after Black Monday, most of our citizens living and working in the Congo were able to escape to Herminestadt where the central power of our mining operations is located. Reports from the missions indicate that around 10.000 of our colonials were able to retreat to Herminestadt where they proclaimed Pierre Ryckmans as their colonial governor. While our government isn't able to launch a full scale offensive to liberate our citizens, the colonials have requested that we sent them weapons, ammunition and food supplies so they can hold off the African war chiefs."

ktg.41.t:0 "Support from the motherland"

Bringing much needed equipment to fill our shortages, tools and Flemish-Wallonian experts have also been transported to help in the rebuilding of the city. Further aid has been promised by Brussel but is awaiting approval in the port of Antwerp."
ktg.41.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

ktg.42.t:0 "The motherland hesitates"
ktg.42.d:0 "While there is definitely political pressure from within the government to support the Flemish-Wallonian citizens (and more importantly the mines), they have decided to await a German response before fully commiting themselves to our cause."

ktg.43.d:0 "News has reached us that the Colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans in Katanga has requested Flemish-Wallonian aid in the rebuilding of their capital and continued support for their army. With around 10.000 Flemish-Wallonians in the colony, their government has no choice but to support their fellow countrymen. For now, they have however hold off awaiting German response. This could be our opportunity to win their support in our recolonisation efforts if we offer our ports and infrastructure to their mission."

ktg.50.d:0 "After the collapse of Mittel-Afrika, the remaining colonial rule was heavily challenged by the [ROOT.GetName] Mwami untill he was finally defeated in Herminestadt and reduced to a titular king. Due to our ambitions to take over the region and our access to the ports of the Atlantic Ocean, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has offered us a trade agreement where we would allow them to use our ports and railroads in exchange for heavy tarrifs. While this could be a profitable agreement, we have to keep our expansion plans in mind. Supporting a Reichspakt colony could drastically reduce our chances of conquest."

ktg.71.d:0 "After the victory over the Mwami, the reinstated colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has procedeed on their path to consolidate their power. As the Mwami licks his wounds in Bunkeya and with the support of the Herminestadt population, a formal letter has been sent to the Mwami informing him that his services are no longer necessary for Katanga and that he has been removed from power. This will surely upset his most loyal followers but after their defeat, some careful precision strikes by the Force Publique and Flemish-Wallonian paratroopers will hopefully exstinguish their flame of reistance."
ktg.71.a:0 "Ryckmans assumes full control over Katanga."

ktg.72.t:0 "The Mwami refuses"
ktg.72.d:0 "Word has returned from Bunkeya where the Mwami, outraged by our demands, has ripped the letter apart and given the order to remobilize his forces. Due to their loss in Herminestadt earlier this year, his troops are undersupplied and lacking in ammunition. Meanwhile the Force Publique has been preparing their assault unit and paracommandos from Flanders-Wallonia have landed in Herminestadt earlier today."

ktg.73.t:0 "The Mwami has fled!"
ktg.73.d:0 "Realising that his position in Bunkeya is unattainable, he has given the order to retreat to the old fortress of Munema where they will entrench themselves and wait for our forces to arrive. Meanwhile the first trucks loaded with our troops have arrived in Bunkeya and the city has been secured. A temporary airstrip has been created to accomodate the paracommandos, while a new plan of action is being formalised."
ktg.73.a:0 "Offer the Mwami a last chance to surrender."

ktg.74.t:0 "Final assault on Munema"
ktg.74.d:0 "Honouring his legacy, the Mwami has decided to die fighting the colonials like his ancestor Msiri did during the Stairs expedition. In reponse to his decision and uncomfortable with the loss of Force Publique lives, Tombeur has given the order to bomb the Munema fortress and follow up with a combined push by Flemish-Wallonian paracommandos and Force Publique foot soldiers. The ancient fortress was not at all capable to resist this type of modern warfare and fell in under 2 hours with the Mwami leading a desperate charge against the paracommandos when he was finally mowed down by combined gunfire. After the dust settled and the wounded carried off for treatement, the final death count was 24 colonial troops against nearly a 1000 of the Mwamis finest."
ktg.74.a:0 "So falls the house of Msiri."

ktgfla.1.t:0 "Football in Katanga"
ktgfla.1.d:0 "Due to Belgian influence and Catholic missionaries from West-Flanders, football is slowly becoming the most important religion in Katanga. Organised by père Raphaël de la Kethulle football matches and small championships are held throughout Herminestadt. Through growing mining cités and the continued education policy of our governor, the père hopes to improve social promotion of the Africans and has requested the government to further expand his vision by the creation of the Association Sportive Congolaise."
ktgfla.1.a:0 "Approve the organisation."

ktgfla.2.t:0 "Recognition from the Flemish-Wallonian Football Association"
ktgfla.2.d:0 "The FWFA has eagerly observed the growing popularity of football and Katanga and has decided to pump further funding into the Association Sportive Congolaise, upgrading its infrastructure, providing better support and even allowing for promotion into the Flemish-Wallonian cup. To further strengthen the bonds between the two organisation, the Beerschot club has announced their visit to Herminestadt to face off against the best of our nation. To show off the successful return of the colonial regime, plans for a new station are being drafted named after Adalbert I."
ktgfla.2.a:0 "Show them that Katanga has entered the 20th century!"

ktgfla.3.t:0 "King Adalbert Stadium"
ktgfla.3.d:0 "Built under the careful supervision of père de la Kethulle and funded by the Association Sportive Congolaise, hundreds of workers have been building for months to finish the prestige project of the Colonial government. Due to the père hundreds of Katangese school children have volunteered to aid in the construction as well hoping to one day be able to become world starts and play in the Flemish-Wallonian league. Built for over 50.000 supporters the stadion is supposed to become the centre of the Herminestadt sport associations with an athletics club planned as well."
ktgfla.3.a:0 "Slowly the building grows."

ktgfla.4.t:0 "Herminestadt-Beerschot"
ktgfla.4.d:0 "Finally the big day has approached, Beerschot has flown from Brussel to Herminestadt to play against the Herminestadt club who was able to defeat Bunkeya in a close 4-3 last month. Accompanied by loud music and even a performance of the Force Publique orchestra, the stadion has started to fill up with more than 50.000 Katangese already inside and more than 20.000 waiting outside. With a burning sun shining on the supporters, the match begun with a goal from Mokuna against the Flemish-Wallonian keeper. The Beerschot attackers were able to turn the tide around at the 42 minute mark scoring two goals against the failing Herminestadt defence, placing the score 2-1 at half-time. During the second half, three more attacks by Beerschot were blocked by the Herminestadt defence and Mokuna was able to score another goal at the 76 minute placing the final score at 2-2. Extatic with the beautiful performance their team was able to present the Flemish-Wallonians, celebrations continued deep into the night together with the Beerschot supporters."
ktgfla.4.a:0 "A fine day for Katanga!"

ktgfla.5.t:0 "Muhemili Abeli against the UMHK"
ktgfla.5.d:0 "After getting caught for stealing a bed, 7 chairs, 5 tables and even a washbasin, Muhemili Abeli has been brought to trial for repeated theft and trade with the black market. She countered that due to the reforms pushed by UMHK after the Black Monday schandal, many of the workers can't afford their life necessities anymore and that she resulted to stealing to sustain her family. Support for her case has been growing in the cité indigène where many more miners have fallen on tough times after the firing of 300 miners last year."
ktgfla.5.a:0 "Start aid measures."

ktgfla.6.t:0 "Further schandals in the UMHK"
ktgfla.6.d:0 "A study in the Herminestadt paper has been published outlining the atrocities commited by the UMHK against the Hutu population of Rwanda. By promising them wealth and succes, many unemployed men have travelled to Herminestadt to be employed in the mines. Insisting that they are naturally protected against low oxygen environements due to their mountainous home and don't need the 'Chambres à Vapeur' to climatise to the situation down below, many of these men have died from loss of oxygen or malaria and secretly burried away from the general public. Now the study has leaked out to the population of Herminestadt resulting in a massive strike against the UMHK until better working conditions can be guaranteed. Over in the Colonial government, debate is also occuring over the replacement of the Chefs in the mine of question to deter exploding anti-colonialist thoughts."
ktgfla.6.a:0 "Fire all the Overseers."

ktgfla.7.t:0 "Conflict within the UMHK"
ktgfla.7.d:0 "In continuation of the pre-Weltkrieg colonial policy, the UMHK has once again dedicated itself to a combination of complex bureaucracy and a general patronising attitude towards it's workers. Due to the expansion of the corpration over the years however this combination is no longer viable for the entire firm leading to loopholes and unjustified punitive measures against the wrong miner. After the economic crisis of 1936, many of the miners are now completely at the mercy of the company, depending on them for food, social facilities, accomodation. To cut back their losses, the UMHK decided to cut back spending for these facilities, causing a general decline in the welfare of the Katangese and increasing calls for better loans and houses now that the economy is back in upswing."
ktgfla.7.a:0 "Discuss with the UMHK board of directors."

ktgfla.8.t:0 "Workshop burned down"
ktgfla.8.d:0 "Near the Ruashi mines, fires have burned down multiple workshops causing the work to come to a complete stop. It looks like it was a deliberate act of arsonry by some of the workers as a protest against the low wages and old housing facilities."
ktgfla.8.a:0 "Improve the housing facilities."

ktgfla.9.t:0 "UMHK demolishes a cemetery"
ktgfla.9.d:0 "In their recent expansion of the cobalt mines in South-Katanga, a group of Flemish-Wallonian construction engineers has accidently detroyed a local cemetery causing outrage amongst the population who claim that the colonials have no repsect for their culture and traditions and are purely here for profit. In Herminestadt, the situation is escalating with multiple shops and cafes run by colonials getting thrashed and a general strike in the UMHK. The colonial government is debating whether to take this opportunity to finally complete the nationalisation of the UMHK, forcing the company to directly change its policy and offer better working conditions to the native workforce."
ktgfla.9.a:0 "Nationalise the UMHK."
ktgfla.9.b:0 "Leave the company independent."

ktgfla.10.t:0 "General strike of Herminestadt"
ktgfla.10.d:0 "After yet another large amount of lay-offs at the UMHK without compensation, hundreds of miners have gathered in the Stade Roi Adalbert to confront the mayor of the city and discuss possible repurcussions for the UMHK. Due to a planned visit to Bunkeya however, Pierre Ryckmans wasn't able to meet with the strikers and has sent his deputy Amour Maron to handle the situation. When Léonard Mpoyi and his collegues however started presenting their evidence to the gathered council, Amour Maron shot the man next to Mpoyi point blank and ordered the Force Publique to open fire on the strikers. Over 50 miners were shot dead with hundreds of wounded. The strike has been quelled but for how long...?"
ktgfla.10.a:0 "Increase the Force Publique garrison in the cité indigène."

ktgfla.11.t:0 "Mutiny in the Herminestadt Barracks"
ktgfla.11.d:0 "Instigated by the aggressive reaction of Amour against the striking workers of the UMHK, Premier sergent-major Ngoie Mukalabushi has revolted against the colonial administration working together with Mpoyi to undermine the Flemish-Wallonian regime and bring full independence to Katanga. Hundreds of miners following Mpoyi have joined forces with the mutinous Force Publique, forcing themselves a way into the white quarter to topple the regime."
ktgfla.11.a:0 "Reinforcements from Bunkeya quel the revolt."
ktgfla.11.b:0 "Colonial rule is once again overthrown."

ktgfla.12.t:0 "Death of Jeanie Prentice"
ktgfla.12.d:0 "Arriving in Congo in 1900 as part of the English [ROOT.GetName] evangelical mission, Jeanie Prentice greatly defined the influence of the church in Katanga. When she finally died last friday, she was the oldest living colonial in Congo and loved by both the colonials as the Katangese."
ktgfla.12.a:0 "A sad day for Katanga."

ktgfla.13.t:0 "Assassination attempt of Père Raphaël"
ktgfla.13.d:0 "At 5.16 pm today a car bomb shook Herminestadt when the car that was supposed to transport Père Raphaël from the colonial headquarters to the Stade Roi Adalbert exploded killing the driver and wounding 8 more people. It's unclear who could have targeted the much adored père who responsible for the introduction of football in the colony but reports indicate that a radical member of the [ROOT.GetName] tribe may have detonated the bomb to express his distrust of the ever increasing power of the Catholic Church. His attempt seemed to have caused the opposite with more and more citizens deciding to abandon their tribal past and become part of the growing population of évolués in the cities."
ktgfla.13.a:0 "Thank God he wasn't hurt."

conbel.1.t:0 "The Congo Civil War"
conbel.1.d:0 "Communications with Dar-Es-Salaam have gone dark as a wave of chaos sweeps over Mittelafrika. The interconnected patchwork of tribal chiefdoms, protectorates, and colonial holdings has seemingly deteriorated overnight, and darkness reigns across Afrika. Within our own borders, various seperatist movements have taken the opportunity to revolt against our rightful rule! To the north in Coquilhatville, a mercenary state rises to oppose our rule, while to the east, the Kivu Clique and the native Congolese seek to throw off the shackles of colonialism. Seizing on this moment of weakness, Leopoldsville to the west has seceded, taking our only sea access with them, while the Miners Union of the south jungles have declared autonomy from our administration to further their own interests. The Congolese Civil War has begun; may God help us all."

conbel.2.t:0 "The situation in Bunkeya"
conbel.2.d:0 "Bunkeya, the faltering jewel of the Garanganze people, lies nestled deep within the Congo-Vrijstaat's southern jungles. Once a bustling center of trade and culture during the reign of the Yeke Kingdom, Bunkeya has long since stagnated in its fall from prosperity. The rule of the joint Flandro-Wallonian-German mission has cast a dark cloud over the colony. Though these Europeans brought the light of civilization, with all of its accompanying technologies and accouterments, they have also brought death and decay. The colony and its native people are overworked by its overseers who use the natives as cheap labor, harvesting the vast natural and mineral riches of the Congo. Though this system has created vast amounts of material wealth for the Flandro-Wallonians, and for Mitteleuropa as a whole, it has also drawn the ire of many natives in the colony. Most prominent among the dissidents of the colonial regime is the Mwami and his loyal followers. The Mwami is the local, rightful ruler to these lands in the eyes of the natives, and his insurrectionary activities continue to be a thorn in the side of our administration and threaten the very stability of our stake here. Before it is too late, a direction must be chosen if the colony is to survive. Whether we crush the Mwami or decide to tolerate their existence, we must be certain it is the correct path. Despite the growing dark clouds on the horizon, both here in the colony and back home on the European mainland, our colonial government must steer itself on a direct and measured course if it is to survive the coming storm."
conbel.2.a:0 "We must deal with this, one way or another."

conbel.3.t:0 "Approaching the Mwami in Peace"
conbel.3.d:0 "After much deliberation, our administration has begrudgingly come to the decision to approach the Mwami and his forces with some semblance of respect and poise in order to peacefully hammer out a resolution to our current conflict. To achieve this admirable goal, we have called "His Highness" to our colonial capital so we may discuss terms for peace. If these peace talks get anywhere, however, remains to be seen..."
conbel.3.a:0 "The only way forward is together."

conbel.4.t:0 "The Mwami Accepts!"
conbel.4.d:0 "Against all odds and expectations, the Mwami and our prideful colonial government have been able to peacefully broker a peace deal, finally and officially ending all current and future hostilities between the Europeans and the Garanganze natives. Across the colony, sighs of relief are heard and celebrations grow wild as peace and hope has been brought to our slice of the Dark Continent. Now, any conflict we face, we shall face together."
conbel.4.a:0 "This is a great day for all of Congo."

conbel.5.t:0 "Colonial Rule Holds On in Congo"
conbel.5.d:0 "We have received word from our subordinate colony of the Congo-Vrijstaat. For months, Pierre Ryckmans and his administration have fought tooth and nail with the Mwami of the southern Congo in Garanganze. Time and time again, peace talks have almost succeeded, only for such hopes to be dashed by another rise in violent conflict: the region has not known peace or stability for what feels like ages. Finally, through either compromise or force, the last of the Mwami’s forces have been quelled, and it seems peace has been brought to the Congo once more. Whether this peace will last, however, is yet to be seen."
conbel.5.a:0 "Finally, peace has reached the black heart of Afrika"

conbel.6.t:0 "Congo Has Rewarded the Évolues"
conbel.6.d:0 "Within the Congo colony, a certain class of natives who have shown a commendable level of skill and value in their service to the colony exists: the Évolues. Functioning as a sort of "middle-class" in the colony, the Évolues complete vital functions key to keeping the colony running, from fields such as nursing to engineering. In recognition of their great and patriotic service to the Flanders-Wallonian colonial empire, the Évolues of the Congo colony have finally been awarded for their long and unwavering service. Their reward shall take the form of better housing, better pay, and greater freedoms and rights within the colony. They will also be granted representatives in the colonial congress who, while holding no voting power, can act as observers so the native voice can at least be heard in colonial meetings. Though our more cynical citizens see this as no more than a master petting its obedient dogs, others view this as a small but important step on the road to African self-determination."
conbel.6.a:0 "How quaint."

conbel.7.t:0 "Heinous Treachery!"
conbel.7.d:0 "It seems our recent dealings with the Mwami have angered the more conservative elements of our colonial administration. With the news of our new peace deal with the natives reverberating throughout the colony, it seems the mining concerns and their lobbyists and cronies in the capital have risen up and declared our current government dead. These rebels claim the current administration has kowtowed to the Mwami and his followers for too long and seek to continue their operations outside of our oversight. They have seized parts of the capital as well as their mining and harvesting operations across the colony and refuse to deescalate the situation. In response, our cabinet has come up with three possible solutions to our problems. The first and most obviously detrimental option is to simply do nothing and let these rebels continue their operations in peace, with proponents for this plan claiming tensions will cool in the coming weeks and that direct military action would be too hasty or drastic. Alternatively, the main opposition to this plan is to ride out and crush this insurrection now before it can grow out of hand. However, among this faction, two different camps have emerged. The first camp seeks to use only the colonial garrison force to crush these rebels, with its followers putting full faith in our garrison to be able to defeat these well-funded partisans. The other camp, seemingly seeing the writing on the wall, has declared that only with Mwami cooperation under a united front can these rebels be fully crushed. The debate raged far into the next morning but by the end of the conference, a clear victor stood among the factions."
conbel.7.a:0 "Form a united front."
conbel.7.b:0 "Attack them!"

conbel.8.t:0 "Loyalty Questions"
conbel.8.d:0 "After months of unending artillery barrages and gunfire so loud it shook the very ground of these ancient jungles, the last of the guns have fallen silent. As the dust settles and the smoke clears, it seems we are the last men standing in this great Congolese Civil War. Now victorious, our forces may lick their wounds as we work to rebuild our nation that lies nestled in the heart of the Dark Continent. While moving towards reconstruction, the question of our international alignment has come up numerous times, and many in our administration feel that we will need allies in order to maintain order and security. However, a small, stalwart clique in our government still maintains that the Congo needs no ally or hegemon, and that our best possible future lies in our hands and our hands alone."
