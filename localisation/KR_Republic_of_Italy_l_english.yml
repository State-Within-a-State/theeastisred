### Parties ###

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_IVANOE_BONOMI_DESC:0 "When the Sicilians and Sardinians withdrew from the Italian Federation, then Prime Minister of the Federation Ivanoe Bonomi dissolved the Federation. Subsequently elected Prime Minister of the new Italian Republic, Bonomi's willingness to work with the much maligned Austria, while economically beneficial, continues to draw great internal scrutiny. Bonomi struggles to weather these increasingly virulent criticisms while cementing the republic's political institutions."

### Ideas ###
ITA_republic_federation:0 "The Unstable Republic"
ITA_republic_federation_desc:0 "When our nation was saved by Austria in 1920, the Habsburgs forced us to give much power to our constituent states, especially Veneto, as part of the Italian Federation. However, this has been adjourned for seven years, effectively disbanded, creating a confusing bureaucratic situation. The opposition also causes no end of trouble, with some calling for the Federation's restoration and some calling for an end to democracy and Austrian influence altogether. The political situation is unlikely to stabilize any time soon."
ITA_republic_unitary:0 "The New Unitary Republic"
ITA_republic_unitary_desc:0 "The power of the states has been curtailed, and all authority now rests with the central government - a government which has eliminated elections and declared itself above responsibility to the people, for the good of the entire country. While the ANI enjoys a great deal of support, there is still considerable resistance to this new government - particularly from the republicans and old monarchists in the country's former states."
ITA_federation_transition:0 "The Federation Restored"
ITA_federation_transition_desc:0 "Now that the power of the Federation Council has been restored, we face the long and difficult task of getting the people and civil service to accept as their government what they once thought of as a museum piece."
ITA_federation_secure:0 "The Federation Rejuvenated"
ITA_federation_secure_desc:0 "The authority of the Federation Council is mostly undisputed, both internationally and internally. The Council now looks to the restitution of its members' former lands." 
ITA_austrian_influence:0 "Austrian Influence"
ITA_austrian_influence_desc:0 "Austria's influence is felt at every level of our nation, from its ownership over many of our companies to the loyalty owed by many of our most highly-placed politicians. Resentment against that influence is high, for even if they have protected us against the syndicalists they are still responsible for our loss in the Weltkrieg. Even so, cutting ties with Austria will prove a difficult and costly task."
ITA_austrian_sanctions:0 "Effects of Nationalization"
ITA_austrian_sanctions_desc:0 "Our economy will need time to recover from our so-called 'divorce' from Austrian domination."
ITA_decentralize_idea:0 "Economic Opportunities in Decentralization"

ITA_remove_austrian_influence:0 "Remove Austrian Influence"
ITA_remove_austrian_influence_desc:0 "The Austrians still hold a strong hold over the [Root.GetAdjective] economy - too strong, in fact.

ITA_attack_austria:0 "Attack the Austrians"

ITA_war_with_venice1:0 "Venice in Revolt"
ITA_war_with_venice1_desc:0 "The Venetians have risen up against the [Root.GetAdjective] government. We must prove that we are able to deal with them quickly, lest our neighbors grow confident that we are weak enough for them to step in and interfere."
ITA_war_with_venice2:0 "Venice in Revolt"
ITA_war_with_venice2_desc:0 "We have lost control of the situation in Venetia. Now we must deal with foreign intervention, on top of conquering the rebellion itself. If we fail to wrap this up within the next six months, it is likely that the ANI government will collapse."
ITA_call_the_austrians_sri:0 "Call the Austrians"

ITA_rally_supporters_desc:0 "There exists a network of resistance to the syndicalists within [SRI.GetNameDef], those who would rise up if called.

ITA_contain_extermism_desc:0 "While our federation has so far persisted despite challenges from radicals of all stripes, any moment of weakness could become an opportunity for tyrants. Liberty cannot be allowed to perish. We must suppress socialist and ultra-nationalist organisations."
ITA_banking_reform:0 "Banking Reform"
ITA_banking_reform_desc:0 "The inherent vulnerability of the current global banking and financial system can no longer be denied. We should pass emergency legislation to stabilise failing banks and pass the most noncontroversial reforms to the system."

ITA_workers_rights:0 "Workers' Rights"
ITA_workers_rights_desc:0 "Italian labourers should never again be tempted by the insidious siren song of socialism, nor crushed beneath an employer's boot. Let us stamp out abuses against workers."
ITA_economic_recovery_act:0 "Economic Recovery Act"
ITA_economic_recovery_act_desc:0 "Our initial recovery efforts have alleviated some of the hardship brought on by Black Monday. We should now implement a comprehensive plan along the same lines as our previous initiatives to ensure that this depression is put fully at an end."

We should reaffirm our commitment to continued cooperation with the unions."

ITA_italian_militerism:0 "Italian Militarism"

ITA_four_economic_battles:0 "Four Economic Battles"
ITA_four_economic_battles_desc:0 "Our nation lies in ruin, not for the failure of any nationalistically minded Italian, but for the actions of so many buffoons the world over.

ITA_destroy_austrian_influence:0 "Create the Unitary Republic"
ITA_destroy_austrian_influence_desc:0 "The Republic granted too much autonomy to its member states, relics of the vestiges of Austrian influence and the Federation. The time has come to abolish their rights and place all power within the central government's hands - even though this might very well mean a fight with those whose autonomy we strip away."
ITA_corporate_alliance:0 "Corporate Alliance"
ITA_corporate_alliance_desc:0 "The natural human urge to profit and succeed is by no means bad, but it must be harnessed to serve the interests of the people and the nation. We should approach businesses large and small which have shown themselves to be patriotic and begin to integrate them into the apparatus of the state."
ITA_corporate_militarism:0 "Corporate Militarism"
ITA_corporate_militarism_desc:0 "Our corporate allies should be put to work building a series of new state armaments factories."
ITA_purge_opposition:0 "Purge Opposition"

ITA_centralized_power_desc:0 "Venetian dissent has been crushed, and power now lies fully with the central government."
ITA_military_loyalty:0 "Loyal Military"
ITA_military_loyalty_desc:0 "Political challenges from those within the armed forces have toppled countless regimes. To ensure loyalty, we should offer low-level positions in our civilian administration to generals and offer other political favours."
ITA_italian_liberation:0 "Italian Liberation"
ITA_italian_liberation_desc:0 "The day of Italian reunification is quickly dawning, and we must be fully prepared to liberate the rest of the peninsula whenever the opportunity arises."
ITA_italy_is_reborn:0 "Italy is Reborn"
ITA_italy_is_reborn_desc:0 "Like a phoenix rising anew, Italy has been reborn. Now, the very identity of our nation must be cemented. Like the Romans of old, the Republic will be abolished forever, and an Imperium shall rise!"

ITA_invest_in_countryside:0 "Invest in the Countryside"

ITA_decentralization:0 "Decentralizing Ideals"
ITA_decentralization_desc:0 "The Italian Federation promotes economic freedom among its member states, with the central government helping out when needed and staying out when not. This attitude should make our member states richer."
ITA_state_intervention:0 "State Intervention"
ITA_state_intervention_desc:0 "The free market has clearly failed, for if it had succeeded the liberals would have stayed in power. Only through state intervention can we end our markets' plunge."
ITA_build_legitimacy:0 "Build Legitimacy"
ITA_build_legitimacy_desc:0 "To many, the Italian Federation was no more in their lives than a sigil on a postage stamp. They view our government as an irrelevant anachronism that will soon collapse. We must assure them that this is not the case."
ITA_fight_republicanism:0 "Fight Republicanism"
ITA_fight_republicanism_desc:0 "We now have the political clout to more actively fight Republican influence in our government. Through political manoeuvring, the dismissal by the Head of the Federation of the most hostile republican politicians can be justified."
ITA_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
ITA_traditional_values_desc:0 "The revolutionary ideals that have taken hold throughout the world are distasteful and an affront to morality. We must establish ourselves as a bastion of traditionalism in Europe."
ITA_church_ties:0 "Church Ties"
ITA_stable_institutions:0 "Stable Institutions"
ITA_stable_institutions_desc:0 "Though liberals and socialists accuse monarchies and conservative governments of failing to adapt to the times, it is they who act too hastily. We, who have overseen too many changes to count and survived them all, say there is power in traditional institutions, and we shall prove this to the people."
ITA_church_ties_desc:0 "The Catholic faith provides strong moral values and a solid foundation for the proper conduct of governments. We must reaffirm our dedication to Catholicism and draw closer to conservative elements within the Church."

### Events ###

ita.1.t:0 "The History of the Italian Federation: Failure and Civil War"
ita.1.d:0 "With the French defeat and the fall of Rome in 1920, an exhausted Italy was left at the mercy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, seemingly destined to be forcibly reorganized into a federation of pre-unification states. Just a year after our humiliating defeat, a coalition of socialists and nationalists proclaimed the new Republic of Italy in Torino, which maintained that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. All over Italy republicans and socialists rose up against the Central Powers. Austria's plans for reorganizing Italy were quickly torn to pieces. However, despite initial successes, our Federation began defeating the Republic on every front. It seemed as if the Republic would cease to exist. However, with help from the Communards in Paris, they were able to evacuate to the South, which was left unoccupied by Austria, leaving the moderates and nationalists to die."
ita.1.a:0 "Terrible."

ita.22.t:0 "The History of the Italian Federation: The Southern Defeat"
ita.22.d:0 "As the civil war dragged on, the Austrians and their garrisons came to fight alongside the Federalists, finding a common enemy in the New Republic and their French supporters. After a victory at the Po against the Socialists, the Federalist and Austrian forces found themselves forced to swallow the bitter pill of prolonged cooperation. The new Federation was forced to sign the Treaty of Vienna, which balkanized the Kingdom, and forced the king to abdicate; as well as allowing the Austrian Empire to occupy Venice for twenty years. Afterwards to make up for this, the Austrians invited the Pope to lead the Federation.\nThis carefully balanced arrangement fell apart in 1922, however, when the socialists were able to successfully invade Naples, and establish a powerbase in Southern Italy. The Socialists were emboldened and there was talk of war, but the Austrians withdrew their army from Italy to deal with internal issues. This threw the peninsula into chaos, our armies were exhausted and unwilling to fight their brothers, which inevitably led to a ceasefire."
ita.22.a:0 "Interesting."

ita.18.t:0 "The History of the Italian Federation: The Risorgimento"
ita.18.d:0 "Though at considerable cost to national pride, the Austrian connection slowly improved the economic standing of the Federation, which drew strength from the German Mitteleuropa and Austrian investment.  As Italy recovered from the civil war's destruction, however, many in the Federation began to rue their government's deal with the Habsburgs, and popular support for Gsbriele d'Annuzio's anti-Austrian Associazione Nazionalista Italiana (Italian Nationalist Association) grew in Lombardy and Piedmont. \n\nPius XI has ruled the country since formation, but his health is declining rapidly, and should something happen to him, the Government, and the Federation as a whole would be thrown into chaos. One thing every Italian has in common is a desire for a free, united Italy, however, and many are sure a second Risorgimento is coming."
ita.18.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

ita.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the Federation"
ita.2.d:0 "The economic crisis that started in Germany has spiralled out of control and has spread to Italy. The Federation's prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and the confidence in the government has been shaken."
ita.2.a:0 "May God Protect us!"

ita.3.t:0 "Ivanoe Bonomi calls for a General Election"
ita.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting the Republic of Italy, Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi has decided to call for an early general election. Elections will be held in 1936 instead of 1937 as was scheduled. Hopefully, with this election, the Prime Minister will be able to shore up support for his policies to resolve the economic crisis."
ita.3.a:0 "Hopefully..."

ita.4.t:0 "Balbo's Speech"
ita.4.d:0 "Italo Balbo of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana delivered a speech in the city of Verona today. During the speech, he blamed the government of the republic for causing the economic crisis. Moreover, he went on to describe Austria's role in keeping Italy divided and weak, and that the syndicalists were only allowed to continue to exist as a foil to the Republic. Balbo promises that it is only the ANI that is able to restore Italy to glory and destroy all her enemies."
ita.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on him"

ita.5.t:0 "The Church Comments on the Crisis"
ita.5.d:0 "A number of influential figures within the church have been rallying support for political figures during their sermons. Of particular note are the Archbishops of Milan and Venice, who have urged parishioners to follow traditional catholic values during this crisis, a none too subtle nod of support for the conservative Popolare Italiano party. However some bishops, though not as influential as those in Milan and Venice, have instead urged support for Catholic Social Teaching and the ruling Liberal Democratic party. In both cases, people are listening to the advice of the church."
ita.5.a:0 "Let us hope the Church is right"

ita.6.t:0 "Rosselli Supports Bonomi"
ita.6.d:0 "Carlo Rosselli, leader of the Lega Democratica Riformista, the Social Democratic party in coalition with Ivanoe Bonomi, has given a speech in Milan supporting the prime minister. This has given valuable support to the besieged ruling party."
ita.6.a:0 "Thank you, Rosselli"

ita.7.t:0 "Protests Against Farm Auctions"
ita.7.d:0 "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages, and their livestock and property are normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practice is deeply unpopular among Italian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Italian People's Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the government's position on the issue?"
ita.7.a:0 "Allow the auctions to continue"
ita.7.b:0 "Pass the bill and ban the auctions"

ita.8.t:0 "Influence in the Milan Government"
ita.8.d:0 "In 1919, we forced the Kingdom of Italy to sign the Treaty of Rome, which reorganized Italy into a Federation, led by the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany. In the following civil war, however, we allied with the White rebel faction and together we barely held the socialists at the Po, ending the war. Subsequently, we forced the Whites to formally renounce their nationalist claims and, as the Republics of Lombardy and Venice, join the Federation. We did concede that a Republican leader would be the interim head of the Federation, though the Federation Council would retain some power behind the scenes. Unfortunately, the Federation Council was allowed to lapse in 1929, and has not been renewed since. Even worse, we recently withdrew our military from their nation due to the Black Monday crisis, leaving them far more independent than they were.\n\nNow the current liberal government under Ivanoe Bonomi has pushed forward the election in a bid for more support in the legislature. However, their victory is not a sure thing, and we have some leeway to influence the election. The three moderate parties that have a real chance at winning are the Liberal Democrats, currently in power, the People's Party, a conservative party who has enjoyed our support in the past, and the Italian Republicans, hostile to monarchy but also vehemently anti-ANI and anti-socialist. We can give our support and backing to one of the pro-Austrian political parties to ensure that the right one takes power in Milan. Some ministers, however, are concerned that overt involvement might result in further support for the far right and anti-Austrian Italian Nationalist Association."
ita.8.a:0 "Support the Liberal Democrats"
ita.8.b:0 "Support the People's Party"
ita.8.e:0 "Overt influence would merely empower the ANI"

ita.9.t:0 "Austria Supports the Liberal Democrats"
ita.9.d:0 "The Austrians have given support to the ruling Liberal Democrats in an attempt to help them win the election. While this has indeed had the intended effect, and encouraged more support for the ruling Liberal Democrats, it has also drawn far more attention to the far right and Anti-Austrian ANI party."
ita.9.a:0 "Hopefully this helps us stay in power"

ita.10.t:0 "Austria Supports the Partito Popolare Italiano"
ita.10.d:0 "The Austrians have given support to the Partito Popolare Italiano in an attempt to help them win the election. While this has indeed the intended effect, and encouraged more support for the Popolares, it has also drawn far more attention to the far right and Anti-Austrian ANI party."
ita.10.a:0 "Even our allies want regime change, it would seem"

ita.12.t:0 "The General Election"
ita.12.d:0 "Today, the Italian people choose a new parliament. The election is tightly fought and very likely will decide the course of Italy for the near future, with four predicted outcomes. Firstly, the liberal democratic coalition under Prime Minister Bonomi can continue, or a liberal coalition led by the anti-autocratic and center-left Liberale Italiano party could ride to victory. Alternately, the conservative coalition led by the Popolare Italiano could be victorious, but few can afford to forget the surprisingly popular Associazione Nazionalista Italiana.

ita.23.t:0 "Dealing with the Syndicalist Economy"
ita.23.d:0 "Now that we have taken control of the territory of the Socialist Republic of Italy the question of what to do with the Syndicalist factories and farms has been brought forth to the Parliament. Those on the left believe in largely leaving the collective farms and factories alone, and letting new companies be private enterprises. This notion has already been denounced by right-wing members of parliament as 'siding with syndicalism', and suggest they should be de-collectivized and privatized. Those in the centre believe that the economy should be de-syndicalized, but slowly, as to not arouse the anger of the syndicalists."

Members of the academy are granted first-class travel on the national railroads, are to be addressed as 'Your Excellency', and receive 3,000 lire a month. While one of the stated goals was to support and promote the sciences, literature and the arts, another goal is to help the new monarchy be better accepted by the people of Italy. To both ends it is succeeding, if slowly."

ita.30.d:0 "It has become increasingly clear that the ANI cannot control the situation in Italy - though neither can the Venetian revolt get the upper hand. If we were to consider intervening, now would be the time to do it - though with an eye towards restoring the power of the Italian Federation under a Habsburg Head, and not towards restoring the failed Italian Republic. Of course, it would require Venetian agreement, but surely they would not refuse our help?"

ita.31.t:0 "Help from the Austrians?"
ita.31.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has offered to help in our battle against [ITA.GetNameDef]. If they intervene, and succeed, it will mean submitting to Austrian influence once the war is over - they will want to dispense with the Italian Republic, and instead restore the power of the Italian Federation of old... no doubt under the domination of a Habsburg ruler, such the Grand Duke of Tuscany. However, we have been assured that our autonomy will be restored to what it was before the election"

ita.33.d.austriawar:0 "It is clear that [ITA.GetNameDef] has lost control of the situation in their country, unable to gain the upper hand against the Venetian rebels. This has brought [AUS.GetNameDef] into the war on the side of the Venetians, and it prompts a question for our government as well: should we make a move to attack? It will mean a race against the Austrians to be the first to capture Milan, and runs the risk of direct contact with Austrian units on the battlefield... a situation which could escalate, if we are not careful."
ita.33.d.austriarefuse:0 "It is clear that [ITA.GetNameDef] has lost control of the situation in their country, unable to gain the upper hand against the Venetian rebels.

ita.33.d.noaustria:0 "It is clear that [ITA.GetNameDef] has lost control of the situation in their country, unable to gain the upper hand against the Venetian rebels.

ita.35.d:0 "[SRI.GetNameDefCap] has fallen to [ITA.GetNameDef]'s troops, and we must ask ourselves whether pressing further into Italy is actually worth it.

Who heads that council will have considerable power, and the main candidates are the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany, Count Visconti of Milan, and Venice's own leader of the revolt, Giuseppe Volpi. Even so, there are others who say that Venice should remain independent, and has no reason to join a federation at all."

The ANI party line is that this is 'for the good of the country', an explanation which also applies to the suspension of future elections. Italy cannot afford to weaken itself to greed and outside loyalties, not now and perhaps not ever. This news has not gone over well in Venetia, however, where the state legislators have expressed fury as what they see as a power grab by the central government. Already people are taking to the streets, and we may expect more formal action to be taken in the days to come."

ita.55.d:0 "Opposition to the unitary republic has grown throughout Italy, with much of it concentrated in the city of Venice. There, Partito Republicano Veneto leader Giuseppe Volpi has given fiery speeches denouncing the ANI and calling on 'loyal Venetians' to rise up and fight against its tyranny. Riots have broken out throughout the city, with violence concentrated against central government offices and troops. Officials fear it is just a matter of days before the state legislature takes a vote on whether or not to withdraw from the republic."

ita.56.t:0 "The Venetian Revolt"
ita.56.d:0 "As predicted, the vote in Venice - with the controlling Partito Republicano Veneto voting unanimously in favor - has led to the declaration of their opposition to the unitary republic. Until, and if, state rights are restored they will see the Republic of Venice separated from [ITA.GetNameDef]. Last-minute talks are being held, but at the moment all government troops are being ordered out of Venetia, and militia forces are quickly being assembled - most likely with aid and assistance by the Austrians."

With the ANI having won the Italian elections, they have attempted to turn the nation into a unitary republic, stripping the composite states of their rights - and now Venetia has rebelled against them. Venetia has called for our help, though we must wait at least a few months before we can directly intervene without it appearing like we are interested only in conquest. If we do intervene, many within the Austrian government are suggesting that our only interest would be in restoring the old Italian Federation, this time under a Habsburg ruler. Indeed, the Italians are so fed up with this failure of democracy, they might welcome such an option with open arms."

It is highly unusual that a lady would make such a request, and a number of ministers believe that she should be refused. However, as a personal friend, the great statesman Italo Balbo believes that a compromise could be reached where she can lead a force of female aviators to fly non-combat missions. This would allow more men to actually fly."

ita.68.d:0 "The Greenshirts, founded during the Civil War, are formally the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (Voluntary Militia for National Security) or MVSN for short, but are most often called by their informal name due to their distinctive green shirts. The Greenshirts are organised in a military fashion modelled on the Arditi soldiers, which also extends to the Uniforms.

The threat of the Socialist Republic of Italy has always kept the alliance in check and the Republic acted as a bulwark against the tide of Syndicalism. Now that threat is gone, and the question is whether should we send an ultimatum to demand that the Republic reform into a Federation, something that will be more acceptable to Vienna.

However, a spokesman for the ANI has declared that next time they will not fail at ridding the world of the 'Austrian lapdog'."
ita.94.d.visconti:0 "Today an attempt on life of the head of the Federation, Count Adriano Visconti, was foiled by the brave men of the Carabinieri.

ita.94.d.volpi:0 "Today an attempt on life of the head of the Federation, Giuseppe Volpi, was foiled by the brave men of the Carabinieri. The news has shaken the government and the people have already declared their wish for the ANI to be found.

ita.95.t:0 "Minister assassinated"
ita.95.d:0 "Today a member of parliament, known for his outspoken royal views, was assassinated by one of the ANI as he was giving a speech in Padua. While the Assassin was caught, the leaders of the ANI still remain at large."
ita.95.a:0 "Damn ANI."

ita.96.t:0 "The ANI Strike"
ita.96.d:0 "Today the Greenshirts of the ANI managed to capture the city of Brescia. The fall of Brescia to these terrorists represents the greatest victory for the ANI in their war against the regime so far. The people of Brescia have welcomed them as liberators, flying a flag of Italy with its centre coat of arms cut out. Greenshirts patrol the streets of the city and violence against anyone suspected of being a monarchist has already begun."
ita.96.a:0 "We must reclaim Brescia!"

ita.97.t:0 "Liberation of Brescia"
ita.97.d:0 "We finally were able to liberate the city of Brescia from the ANI scum. The battle was bloody and fighting was block by bloody block but we were able to drive them out of the city. Though the ANI were welcomed at first as liberators, the terror the Greenshirts inflicted in their purge of monarchists soured their opinions. Today the Army is being welcomed as the real liberators of the city."
ita.97.a:0 "They're on the run."

ita.98.t:0 "Ringleaders caught"
ita.98.d:0 "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the ANI organisation were apprehended by Carabinieri investigators. This is a serious blow to the nationalistic terrorists, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
ita.98.a:0 "It's only a matter of time."

ita.99.t:0 "The Anni di Piombo is over"
ita.99.d:0 "Today, we have declared victory against the ANI terrorists. They are finally destroyed. No more will these far-right nationalists trouble our country."
ita.99.a:0 "Finally they are destroyed."

ita.102.t:0 "Creation of the Mille Miglia"
ita.102.d:0 "With Italy once again reunited a number of automotive companies and auto-enthusiasts have come up with what they believe will be the premier racing competition in Italy – The Mille Miglia. The Mille Miglia or 'Thousand Miles' starts in Brescia and goes all the way down to Rome before returning via a different route to Brescia."
ita.102.a:0 "See them go!"

ita.103.t:0 "The Palazzo Mezzanotte"
ita.103.d:0 "In Milan, the Palazzo Mezzanotte was unveiled today. The Palazzo Mezzanotte is to be the replacement for the old Stock Exchange of the Republic, designed with a tasteful mixture of neoclassical and modern architecture. With Black Monday now dissipating, the Palazzo Mezzanotte is already being considered the principal stock exchange in Italy."
ita.103.a:0 "Money is good."

ita.104.t:0 "Legnano"
ita.104.d:0 "Today, the Historical Epic film 'Legnano' was released across the republic to widespread acclaim. The film tells the story of the Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa and his attempt to control Italy, leading to the creation of the Lombard League and the Battle of Legnano. It was directed by Romolo Marcellini, and stars Fosco Giachetti, Luisa Ferida, and Osvaldo Valenti and funded by the ANI. Due to obvious parallels with the Austrian Empire, it has drawn criticism from the Austrians, despite that the Italian public seems to enjoy the film."
ita.104.a:0 "Today we expel the Black Eagle from Lombardy!"

ita.105.t:0 "1936 Cansiglio Earthquake"
ita.105.d:0 "In the early hours before dawn, the regions of Northeastern Italy on the Cansiglio were shaken by a terrific earthquake. Tragically 19 people were killed and countless more injured. Many of the smaller towns in the region were destroyed or damaged."
ita.105.a:0 "May God save them."

ita.106.t:0 "Anniversary of the Golden Ambrosian Republic"
ita.106.d:0 "500 years ago in Milan, the citizens of the city chased out the Visconti and set up a Republic in the city. Though the city would be betrayed and become a monarchy again, the ideas of the Republic still resonate with the people in and around Milan. Within Milan, there is a big celebration and a week-long festival celebrating the 500th anniversary of their attempt at a republic."
ita.106.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

ita.107.d:0 "With the economy strong, a number of fashion designers in Milan have decided to set up a week-long event in the Spring so that Milan, and with her Italy, can become the fashion capital of the world.

ita.107.a:0 "Milan shall be the fashion capital of the world!"

ita.108.t:0 "Carina Massone Negrone Sets a New Record"
ita.108.d:0 "The famed Italian aviator Carina Massone Negrone has set a new record for aviation by flying up to 12,043 meters(39,402 feet) in her biplane and breaking a new record. A personal friend of Italo Balbo himself, her new record has made her popular within the republic, especially in nationalist circles."
ita.108.a:0 "A new record for Italy."

ita.109.t:0 "Gabriella Angelini's Solo Flight"
ita.109.d:0 "Gabriella 'Gaby' Angelini has just completed her solo trip from Delhi. Already famous for visiting eight different countries, the young Aviator has become one of the most popular figures within Italy. At 25 years old she has captivated the people within the republic and even from outside of the republic. The Corriere della Sera was quoted as writing, 'This young Italian girl showed how females can be daring and not lose any of their truly exquisite femininity'."
ita.109.a:0 "Three cheers for Gaby Angelini!"

ita.110.t:0 "The Enciclopedia Italiana"
ita.110.d:0 "The Enciclopedia Italiana project has finally been completed. The Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti or just 'Enciclopedia Italiana' for short is a 35 volume encyclopedia of the sciences and arts. Meant to showcase the intellectual might of the ANI who sponsored it, it has proven rather popular throughout the intellectual community of the Republic. Even those that against the ANI find the work an achievement to be proud of."
ita.110.a:0 "A valuable work, regardless of the intent."

ita.120.t:0 "The War Against Italy"
ita.120.d:0 "We are losing badly in the war against [ITA.GetNameDef]. While it's possible we might still be able to turn things around, we do have another option: offer them our lands in southern Tyrol and the Littoral, and hope they will take that offer and leave us be. If they do not... it is entirely possible they might reach all the way to Vienna, and then our empire is lost to us for good."
ita.120.a:0 "Let's end this while we can."
ita.120.b:0 "Surrender to the Italians? Never!"

ita.121.t:0 "Austria Proposes Peace"
ita.121.d:0 "The Austrians are on the run, and have clearly realized they stand no chance against Italian forces. In exchange for peace with [Root.GetNameDef], they have offered us our claimed lands in Trentino and the Littoral. Shall we take their deal and walk away now?"
ita.121.a:0 "Yes, let's end this while we can."
ita.121.b:0 "No - we wipe them out here and now."

ita.122.t:0 "Venetia is Lost"
ita.122.d:0 "The war against [ITA.GetNameDef] has definitely not gone as planned. We were unable to prevent them from overtaking Venetia, and now we must make the decision whether to continue the war or pull out completely and leave Italy to its own fate. Any peace could be temporary, of course - it's not impossible that the Italians could turn around and attack us again, but perhaps the breather would be worth it?"
ita.122.a:0 "We must pull out at once"
ita.122.b:0 "Surrender to the Italians? Never!"

ita.123.t:0 "Austria Withdraws from Venice"
ita.123.d:0 "We have taken control over Venetia, despite the Austrian intervention, and now they are busy pulling their troops out as quickly as they can. So much for their lordship over Italy."
ita.123.a:0 "We will come for them later."

ita.124.t:0 "Austria Winning in Italy"
ita.124.d:0 "Our allies in Italy have surrendered to Austria, and now we are bogged down in a southern war which could drain our strength needlessly. Should we call an end to this?"

ita.125.t:0 "Sicilians Winning in Italy"
ita.125.d:0 "Our allies in Italy have surrendered to [SIC.GetNameDef], and now we are bogged down in a southern war which could drain our strength needlessly. Should we call an end to this?"

ita.126.t:0 "Venice Has Fallen"
ita.126.d:0 "Venice has fallen to the forces of [SRI.GetNameDef], and now they threaten [Root.GetNameDef] itself. Should we call an end to this war, while we still can?"

ita.127.t:0 "Austria in Trouble"
ita.127.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has pushed far into Austria, and apparently intends to conquer the entire thing instead of sticking to its claims. It is clearly dangerous."
ita.127.a:0 "We should help Austria!"
ita.127.b:0 "There is nothing we can do"

ita.128.t:0 "The German Intervention"
ita.128.d:0 "It seems that [From.GetNameDef] has become alarmed by our aggressive invasion of [AUS.GetNameDef]. Fearing our intention is to conquer it outright, the Germans have come to the aid of their former Weltkrieg allies."
ita.128.a:0 "Damn it!"

ita.150.t:0 "Withdrawal from the Italian Republic"
ita.150.d:0 "Black Monday has hit [AUS.GetNameDef] hard... hard enough that many of our companies have been forced to withdraw from [ITA.GetNameDef]. Not only has our economic hold over the Italians weakened, we also cannot afford to maintain our occupation forces there. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent. We will have to maintain a working relationship with them, at least until we can restore our own strength."
ita.150.a:0 "Our sphere of influence retracts."

ita.151.t:0 "The Austrian Withdrawal"
ita.151.d:0 "Black Monday has hit [AUS.GetNameDef] hard. Their markets have plunged so low that many Austrian stockholders of Austro-Italian companies have panicked and sold countless bonds to native Italians, weakening the Austrian stranglehold over our economy. Not only have we rid ourselves of foreign economic influence, the Austro-Hungarian Reichskriegsminister has recalled the divisions stationed in our territory, unable to afford the financial burden of keeping us safe from what many in Vienna foolishly believe to be an empty Socialist threat. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent of Austrian domination, at least until they regain their full strength. Many Italians are worried about whether or not this will leave us exposed to attack by [SRI.GetNameDef]. A war right now would be a terrible prospect."
ita.151.a:0 "Is this a step towards a free Italy?"

ita.152.t:0 "ANI Protests Elections"
ita.152.d:0 "Massive demonstrations were held today in Milan as well as other cities throughout [Root.GetNameDef], with ANI leader Italo Balbo accusing the government of rigging the elections with Austrian assistance. Austrian influence is felt everywhere throughout the country, Balbo said, and suggested that Italians would never have true independence until they overthrew their oppressors. While Balbo has yet to show any true evidence of rigging, his words still found many eager listeners... and there is a growing concern that his cadre of followers might cause trouble for the government."
ita.152.a:0 "Outlaw the ANI and shut them down."
ita.152.b:0 "Keep a close eye on him - this is still a democracy."

ita.153.t:0 "Greenshirts Wreak Havoc"
ita.153.d:0 "In response to the recent government crackdown, Italo Balbo's most ardent supporters within the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, dubbed 'Greenshirts' by the media, have been spreading chaos throughout the nation. Already they have been directly implicated in two riots and several bombings, with posters accusing the Italian government of conspiracy and selling out to foreign interests being plastered everywhere in the capital. Their wave of chaos is spreading, and many are accusing Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] of incompetence for taking too strong a stance against the ANI and provoking the violence."
ita.153.a:0 "How long will this go on?"

ita.154.t:0 "Anti-Government Demonstrations"
ita.154.d:0 "As the terror campaign by the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana continues, protests against the government's inept handling of the violence have erupted throughout the country. The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not round up the ANI ringleaders soon. Despite the protests, it is clear that the police actions against Balbo's group are having limited effect - indeed, he appears to be gaining as many followers as he loses to the mass arrests."
ita.154.a:0 "We are doing what we can!"

ita.155.t:0 "The March on Milan Fails"
ita.155.d:0 "With the government crackdown growing more severe in recent days, Italo Balbo called on his supporters to march on the parliament building in Milan today - provoking a massive demonstration which turned into a full-on battle in the middle of the city as the police and military took prompt action. With hundreds of casualties, Balbo and his supporters were eventually dispersed. Italo Balbo remains at large, however, and despite his failure to enact a coup there are now calls for the government to step down. Opposition parties claim the republic is in chaos and intend to force a vote of confidence in the Italian parliament as soon as possible."
ita.155.a:0 "At least Balbo is out of the picture."

ita.156.t:0 "The Vote of Confidence"
ita.156.d:0 "Today the vote of confidence will be held in the Italian parliament. At stake is the very survival of the republic - if the government falls, it will be a clear sign that the system is considered dysfunctional, and many are reluctant to turn to yet another chaotic election campaign. Indeed, members of the nobility have been gathering supporters around them and are already suggesting that an empowerment of the monarchical Federation Council might be preferable. The threat of this has pulled other officials to call for votes in support of the government, no matter what."
ita.156.a:0 "The government narrowly survives the vote."
ita.156.b:0 "The government falls."

ita.157.t:0 "Return to the Federation?"
ita.157.d:0 "With the government fallen and faith in the republic destroyed, there are two options for how the government can proceed. One is to restore the power of the Federation, where members of the nobility would take up administrative posts on the Federal Council, to be led either by the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany, Pietro Ferdinando, or Count Adriano Visconti of Lombardy. Elections would be restricted throughout parts of the country and democracy as we know it would end. While many favor the stability that route would bring, there are others, among them Venetian nationalists, who suggest disbanding the Federation in its entirety - the states of Venetia and Lombardy would become independent entities, even though such a separation might only prove an opportunity for outside forces to pounce."
ita.157.a:0 "Restore the Federation under the Grand Duke of Tuscany."
ita.157.b:0 "Restore the Federation under Count Visconti."
ita.157.c:0 "Disband the Republic completely."

ita.158.t:0 "ANI Recruiting in the Military"
ita.158.d:0 "The popularity of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana continues to grow unchecked, and now it appears Italo Balbo has been campaigning hard amongst the generals of the Republican army. It is unknown whether any have agreed to join his cause, but rancor against the government has been increasing and many officials fear a coup could be in the offing. Taking a stand against the ANI now, however, could provoke the kind of violence which might drive the army towards supporting Balbo even if they weren't already considering it. What shall we do?"
ita.158.a:0 "We must act now, no matter the consequences."
ita.158.b:0 "Campaign for our own support and prepare for the worst."

ita.159.t:0 "Massive ANI Demonstrations"
ita.159.d:0 "As support for the ANI increases, and violent riots in [ITA.GetNameDef] become commonplace, protests against the government's inept handling of the situation have erupted throughout the country. The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not deal with the ANI ringleaders soon. Protestors are suggesting that the government's inaction is tantamount to incompetence."
ita.159.a:0 "We are doing the best we can!"

ita.160.t:0 "The March on Milan"
ita.160.d:0 "Italo Balbo, leader of the ANI, today called for a massive march on the royal palace in Milan, suggesting that a show of force is the only way to force the government to resign and clear the country of Austrian influence and corruption. The crowds pouring into the central square are massive, and as the Italian police and military move in it is clear that the resulting bloodshed will be horrific. Already, even before it is determined whether Balbo's coup might be successful, there are members of the opposition calling for a vote of confidence concerning the government's handling of the situation. Such calls might be moot, however, if Balbo's sheer numbers win the day..."
ita.160.a:0 "Balbo's coup is successful."
ita.160.b:0 "Balbo and his supporters are dispersed."

ita.161.t:0 "ANI Ringleaders Finally Caught"
ita.161.d:0 "While the leader of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, Italo Balbo, remains at large, today it was announced that most of his co-conspirators in the nationwide terror campign have finally been captured. Most are now awaiting trial, while the country breathes a sigh of relief. Many consider this to be a sign that the worst of [ITA.GetNameDef]'s political struggles are over."
ita.161.a:0 "It's about time!"

ita.170.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims [claimed_state.GetName]"
ita.170.d:0 "With a resurgence in irredentism since reuniting the country, [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [Root.GetNameDef]. [Root.GetAdjective] citizens in the region are understandably alarmed, although native Italians have already started protesting in the streets and demanding that they be reunited with the motherland."
ita.170.a:0 "They dare!"

ita.171.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the [Root.GetFactionName]"
ita.171.d:0 "With a resurgence in irredentism since reuniting the country, [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [claimed_state.Owner.GetNameDef]. Since the state is already claimed by a member of the [Root.GetFactionName], the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided that its goals are incompatible with those of the alliance and has elected to withdraw. Whether this means a war with [From.GetNameDef] is in the offing remains to be seen."
ita.171.a:0 "A foolish move"

ita.172.t:0 "Anti-Syndicalist Partisans Rise Up"
ita.172.d:0 "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network preparing for the day when we and [ITA.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
ita.172.a:0 "It will change nothing"

ita.175.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims Libya"
ita.175.d:0 "Citing the fact that their Libyan colony was only unjustly wrested from Italy thanks to their loss in the Weltkrieg, the [From.GetAdjective] government today announced that it was now claiming the entirety of Tripolitania as their own. Whether that will mean a demand is forthcoming, or even war, remains to be seen."
ita.175.a:0 "How dare they!"

ita.176.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Libya"
ita.176.d.owns:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has issued an ultimatum to us: turn over all our territory in Tripolitania at once - which they claim, in its entirety - or they will be forced to invade. Already, [From.GetAdjective] ships are crossing the Mediterranean and making their intentions rather obvious."
ita.176.d.subject:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has issued an ultimatum to us: turn over all our territory in Tripolitania at once. This includes cutting [LBA.GetNameDef] loose from our control. which [From.GetNameDef] would presumably then invade. Already, [From.GetAdjective] ships are crossing the Mediterranean and making their intentions rather obvious."
ita.176.a:0 "Fine, give them what they want"
ita.176.b:0 "If it's a war they want, they'll get it!"

ita.177.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons Us"
ita.177.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has responded to a demand by the [From.From.GetAdjective] government, which claims Tripolitania as its own, by agreeing to cut us loose - already [From.GetAdjective] officials and [From.GetAdjective] forces are busy leaving [Root.GetNameDef]. One assumes that a declaration of war from [From.From.GetNameDef] will be forthcoming shortly."
ita.177.a:0 "We shall see!"

ita.178.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Relented"
ita.178.d.give:0 "Apparently too terrified at the prospect of starting a war with us over the territory, [From.GetNameDef] has relented to our ultimatum and turned over all their owned land within Tripolitania. Diplomacy has won the day!"
ita.178.d.abandon:0 "Apparently too terrified at the prospect of starting a war with us over the territory, [From.GetNameDef] has relented to our ultimatum and cut [LBA.GetNameDef] loose. They are no longer responsible for the [LBA.GetAdjective] government and will not protect them. We are free and clear to invade, if we should so wish."
ita.178.a:0 "Excellent"

ita.179.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
ita.179.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has utterly refused our ultimatum. It seems we have little choice but to go to war."
ita.179.a:0 "So be it!"

ita.180.t:0 "The Italians are Winning"
ita.180.d:0 "The war is going poorly. [libya_italy.GetNameDefCap] has succeeded in occupying Tripolitania, and we are so far unable to dislodge them from it. Nor have we been able to occupy any of their mainland territory. Many within the [Root.GetAdjective] government feel that now is the time to sue for peace and stop this war before it goes on any longer."
ita.180.a:0 "End this now"
ita.180.b:0 "We must keep fighting!"

ita.181.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
ita.181.d:0 "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided it would rather sue for peace than keep on defending Tripolitania. If we end the war now, they will hand it over - and that will be that."
ita.181.a:0 "That's all we want"
ita.181.b:0 "No, we shall pursue this to the end!"

ita.182.t:0 "We Are Losing"
ita.182.d:0 "Our attempt to regain Libya has led to disastrous results, and now we are in danger of losing the entire country. Perhaps if we offer to simply give up our claims on Libya entirely, and hand over any lands claimed by [peace_country.GetNameDef] or its allies, they might be willing to simply end things now?"
ita.182.a:0 "We must try"
ita.182.b:0 "No, we can still win!"

ita.183.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
ita.183.d:0 "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided its pursuit of Libya has come at too high a price. They have offered to give up their claims on Tripolitania entirely, and hand over any land that we or our allies claim (if any exist), if we will simply call off the war now."
ita.183.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
ita.183.b:0 "They started this, now we will see it through"

ita.184.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Resistance Collapses"
ita.184.d:0 "Since the [Root.GetAdjective] government went into exile, it has been difficult to maintain resistance in the face of our fellow Italians. They have worked hard to erode our legitimacy, and now it seems all our efforts have come to naught. They have proven themselves victorious."
ita.184.a:0 "Porca miseria!"

ita.185.t:0 "The War Drags On"
ita.185.d:0 "The war against [peace_country.GetNameDef] and the [peace_country.GetFactionName] has dragged on for months, and considering we've already defeated their Italian allies it seems pointless to continue. Perhaps we can suggest they agree to a simple truce, where all we gain is the land we already have and any claims of ours held by [peace_country.GetNameDef] or their allies. Nothing more."
ita.185.a:0 "Let's make the suggestion"
ita.185.b:0 "No - we will fight this to the bitter end!"

ita.186.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Proposal"
ita.186.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has approached us suggesting peace - we end this war now, with them walking away with whatever they've already taken and any claimed lands still held by us or other members of the [Root.GetFactionName], and call it even. The alternative is to continue this war even longer, one where we have made absolutely no headway."
