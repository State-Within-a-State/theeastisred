###Tooltips###
KTX_darkest_hour:0 "The Texan Kaiserreich"

KTX_kili:0 "Der Schuss am Kilimandscharo"
KTX_kili_desc:0 "When we fled our homeland we did not manage to bring much of our infrastructure or equipment. What we did manage to salvage was our vital nuclear research. We shall conduct a test at El Paso to help us maximise the potential of these weapons to help us to return us home."
KTX_air:0 "Fünf Wochen in der Luft"
KTX_air_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly our air force was all but lost in the flight to Texas. We must retrain and drill the former Texan air force to our imperial standards or else retaking the mainland will prove to be a near-impossibility."
KTX_exiled_eco:0 "What Little We Have Left..."
KTX_exiled_eco_desc:0 "What little we have left we need to maximise and use to its full capability. 110% production quotas and squeezing every drop of productivity out of our workforce will go a long way towards achieving this."
KTX_exiled_mil:0 "... We Need To Make Great"
KTX_exiled_mil_desc:0 "Old guns, new guns, it doesn't matter. If it can kill a Frenchman we will build it and use it as effectively as we are able. We have no other choice."
KTX_exiled_eco2:0 "... We Need To Make More"
KTX_exiled_eco2_desc:0 "Our previous initiatives have been successful in providing us with a greater industrial base, but it is simply not enough. We must expand our industries even further if we are to take back the Fatherland."
KTX_exiled_infra:0 "... We Need To Bring Together"
KTX_exiled_infra_desc:0 "Our African domain is vast and hard to traverse making it difficult to pool our limited resources together. We need to improve our infrastructure situation in order to amend this problem."
KTX_exiled_total:0 "Waste Not, Want Not"
KTX_exiled_total_desc:0 "While our industrial programs have borne fruit we are always in need of more production to help us reclaim the birthright. We shall order all factories and local officials to redouble their efforts."
KTX_spirit_of_resistance:0 "The Spirit of Resistance"
KTX_spirit_of_resistance_desc:0 "The Fatherland is lost. In this time of absolute crisis we must place our faith in Kaiser and Country. Already the people are uniting around the Lion of Afrika, Lettow-Vorbeck, and many are seeing the return of a Weltkrieg-style burgfriedenspolitik truce in party politics."
KTX_afrikakorps:0 "German Cowboys"
KTX_afrikakorps_desc:0 "Cowboys are a essential part of Texan Culture, but with Germany arriving, the cowboys have become a vital tool to reclaim the birthright"
KTX_the_way_home:0 "Our Only Way Home"

KTX_walking_over_water:0 "Walking Over Water"
KTX_walking_over_water_desc:0 "We must travel long and far to return to the Fatherland, and as such we must plan and prepare accordingly. A determined effort to produce and requisition troop transports is an absolute must."

KTX_old_enemies_new_allies_desc:0 "The Panama Canal is a vital port to control if we want to retake the Vaterland. We need to buldoze the pathetic microstates that stand in our way"

KTX_our_continent_desc:0 "Ever since the continent's fate was decided at the Berlin Conference in 1884 we have held certain affinity for it as part of our desire for a Place in the Sun. Now that we reside on the dark continent we shall make sure our ties to the land are borne out in practice, at both a national and local level."
KTX_crush_france:0 "Crush France"
KTX_crush_france_desc:0 "While there is a cruel irony in that we and the French have both been exiled from Europe, it is the only affinity that we share. We should crush them, seize their holdings and adapt their industries to better forge the way for our homecoming. There can be no mercy."
KTX_afrikakorps2:0 "Museum Pieces"
KTX_afrikakorps2_desc:0 "No longer can we let our old arms sit in glass cabinets to be ogled by gentlemen in their hunting lodges. Every musket and elephant gun we have must be thrust into the hands of those capable of bearing them. After all, they did help win us one Weltkrieg. They shall win us a second."
KTX_afrikakorps3_1:0 "A New Berlin"
KTX_afrikakorps3_1_desc:0 "We will grant the exiled Germans further powers in return for their loyal service to the Vaterland in its time of despair. Hopefully this will encourage more to sign up."
KTX_afrikakorps3_2:0 "Texas Forever"
KTX_afrikakorps3_2_desc:0 "Though there have been calls to throw our principles to the wind in order to sign up more Native Germans, they should be ignored. We will not return to Berlin by any means necessary, and extending suffrage and protections to Afrikans is intolerable to any good German."

KTX_business_desc:0 "Canada has been a useful ally in helping us to reclaim the homeland, and for this they have our respect. This does not however mean that they are no longer a threat to our Empire, and realpolitik comes before all other concerns. After all, it is only business."

KTX_aog_desc:0 "The Loyal forces of the AOG have been figting on in our abscence. It is time to intergrate their forces back into the Vaterland"

KTX_dei_desc:0 "The Dutch East Indies have been abandoned, but, we cannot let them survive as an independent nation. They are weak, and we need to pick them off. They just have too many valuable rescoursces to let go"
KTX_eyes_south:0 "Eyes South"
