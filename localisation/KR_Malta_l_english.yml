## Events ##

malta.1.t:0 "Whispers from Malta..."
malta.1.d:0 "The Abteilung has received word of a mysterious organization, believed to behind many of the turbulent events of the year. This secret society, based in Malta is causing global instability through both international terrorist attacks, giving power to fringe groups, and killing high-profile political leaders, creating political instability, and creating global economic collapse; as well as much more. After tracing back several bonds from German industrial titans, tracking the location of prominent Junker executives as well as tracking back hundreds of different offices worth paperwork’s, the Abteilung has identified a secret organization based in Malta as a key player in the Black Monday collapse, which the organization has played a key role in causing. \n\n This organization, known as the “New Sons of Malta”, has been key in many major events from the last year such as the Pope’s death, the Black Monday Crisis, several terrorist attacks in the United States. As well, the Assassination of President Alexander Kerensky is rumoured to be their work; and many more events across the globe have been tied to this group, who seek to create instability worldwide. The roots in this organization run deeper than ever imagined, as nearly the entire German economic elite, half of the Abteilung high command, as well as having informants in the FBI. In addition, traced fund networks in America link this order to prominent Mafia officials, and fringe political groups such as the Spiritualist Party. They can also be tied to Mercenaries in Africa, Cult leaders in China and Imperial Officers in Japan; as well as many more groups that can not directly be linked to them. \n\n The Abteilung has now managed to identify the heads of this organization, who want revenge on the German Empire for controlling Malta. Causing instability and chaos worldwide appears all part of their scheme to cripple Germany and bring down the German Empire.""

Many of their plans have been lost to time, and the heads of this shadowy organization will remain forever unknown, we can only guess just how deep their roots run. The operatives of the Sons of Malta are now left stranded, the organization on their payroll now left without a benefactor, and their work left unfinished.
