SRD_entente_cold_shoulder_desc:0 "While the Entente was fine with using us as a tool against the socialists and competing imperial powers they are less fond of defending us from a better claimant to the House of Savoy in the same region that is commanding an army of even more fanatical anti-socialists whom will also cause problems for the Socialist Republic of Italy. They obviously hope to simply side with whomever comes out on top as their Italian ally and therefor resolving this war ourselves with prove our worth."
