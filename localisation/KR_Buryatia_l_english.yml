### Semyenov Events ###
transbaikalia.1.t:0 "Dealing With the Current Troubles"
transbaikalia.1.d:0 "Ataman Semyenov finally has the entire Transbaikal region at his disposal and can restore order in it with a firm hand.\n\nThe main problems at the moment are rampant crime, Siberian regionalists, socialist partisanship and Buryat-Mongolian separatism. To solve all the pressing problems, it is necessary to make a primary decision: to convene a People's Regional Council, or to leave the region in a state of martial law, so that nothing prevents the ataman from pursuing his policy."
transbaikalia.1.a:0 "Form the advisory council."
transbaikalia.1.b:0 "Maintain the martial law."

transbaikalia.2.b:0 "Demand he gets rid of the council."

transbaikalia.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Disbanding the Council"
transbaikalia.3.d:0 "Central Government in Vladivostok has demanded that we immediately disband the Council we have just established as this decision was made without permission of the Supreme Ruler."
transbaikalia.3.a:0 "Well..."
transbaikalia.3.b:0 "Who they are to tell us what to do?"

transbaikalia.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Disbands the Council"
transbaikalia.4.d:0 "As demanded earlier, the People's Regional Council in Transbaikalia has been disbanded by Ataman Semyenov, bringing back the martial law. At least, they are still loyal to us."
transbaikalia.4.a:0 "Great."

transbaikalia.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Disband the Council"
transbaikalia.5.d:0 "Despite our demands, Ataman Semyenov refused to disband the council. Although this would normally be regarded as a betrayal and refusal to follow the order of the Supreme Ruler, in the conditions of martial law in Transbaikalia, it seems that we have no choice but to accept the Transbaikal Council as a fact."
transbaikalia.5.a:0 "This raises suspicions."

transbaikalia.6.t:0 "Semyenov's Appeal to the Buryat-Mongolian Nation"
transbaikalia.6.d:0 "Today, Ataman Semyenov, the governor of the Transbaikal Military District, appealed to all citizens who identify themselves as Buryat-Mongols with promises to soon give them broad autonomy and grant legislative and executive rights to Burnatskom.\n\nThe Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy will be officially established on the territory of Verkhneudinsk and in the surrounding lands. Nevertheless, as long as martial law is in effect in the region, all supreme power will belong to Ataman Semyenov."
transbaikalia.6.a:0 "A great victory for Buryat-Mongol people."

transbaikalia.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Established Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy"
transbaikalia.7.d:0 "The recent news from the wild Transbaikalia are the following. Ataman Semyenov has established the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy in Verkhneudinsk and around it. Moreover, he has given legislative and executive power to the Burnatskom - a local Buryat-Mongol Council, which goes against our interests."
transbaikalia.7.a:0 "This will gain some sympathy towards our government."
transbaikalia.7.b:0 "Demand he reverts the autonomy."

transbaikalia.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands We End the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy"
transbaikalia.8.d:0 "Central Government in Vladivostok has demanded that we immediately revert the Buryat-Mongolian autonomy we have just established as this decision was made without permission of the Supreme Ruler."

transbaikalia.10.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Keeps the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy"
transbaikalia.10.d:0 "Despite our demands, Ataman Semyenov refused to end the autonomy for Buryat-Mongols. Although this would normally be regarded as a betrayal and refusal to follow the order of the Supreme Ruler, in the conditions of martial law in Transbaikalia, it seems that we have no choice but to accept the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy as a fact."
transbaikalia.10.a:0 "This raises suspicions."

transbaikalia.11.t:0 "Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"
transbaikalia.11.d:0 "Ataman Semyenov decided to create a new Cossack Host in the Military District, consisting of Buryat-Mongols and controlled by the Transbaikal Cossacks. Such an initiative, according to the ataman, will contribute to the creation of a strong army, relying on horses, that have served the Buryat-Mongols faithfully for centuries."
transbaikalia.11.a:0 "Great!"

transbaikalia.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Established Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"
transbaikalia.12.d:0 "The recent news from the wild Transbaikalia are the following. Ataman Semyenov has established the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host, under control of the Transbaikal Cossacks. Even if the establishment of the Cossack Host is a full right of Ataman Semyenov, it may go against our interests."
transbaikalia.12.a:0 "He can do it, we cannot resist it."
transbaikalia.12.b:0 "Demand he disbands the Host."

transbaikalia.13.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands We Disband the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"

transbaikalia.15.a:0 "This raises suspicions."

transbaikalia.16.t:0 "Sacred War Against Bolshevism"
transbaikalia.16.d:0 "Now that we have more or less strengthened the power in Transbaikalia, it is time to fight the main enemy. There is no one whom Ataman Semyonov would hate more than the Bolsheviks. Having been one of the first to declare war on Lenin, Semyenov has long established himself as a militant fighter against everything Bolshevik. In Transbaikalia, the so-called partisan army of the NRA is most active. Partisan cells are everywhere, irritating the people and enslaving their minds with fairy tales about communism. The most prominent of them are the so-called Godless - near-proletkultist accomplices of Satan, destroying churches and killing priests, as well as disturbing peaceful Buddhists. It is necessary to destroy this Bolshevik scum as soon as possible!"
transbaikalia.16.a:0 "Catch these outlaws!"

transbaikalia.17.t:0 "Preparation of Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.17.d:0 "Yemelyan Yaroslavsky - the leader of the Union of the Militant Godless is none other than an ordinary fatman hiding under a false name and afraid to appear in the light, while crowds of his fanatics shed blood for false ideas. He is a coward and a traitor to the Motherland, who tries to decompose it at the expense of others. At the expense of people who could faithfully serve the Motherland. But we have some good news. Our informant reported about a meeting of the Union of the Militant Godless in Chita, where Yaroslavsky himself is rumored to be. It is necessary to carefully prepare an operation to eliminate this fat scum and destroy his best fighters. So this God-defying movement will fail.\n\nWe have several options for how to arrange a raid. The first is to blow up the building where the meeting will be held. Despite the fact that in this way we cannot avoid civilian victims, this guarantees us success in the fact that Yaroslavsky will not only be destroyed, he will honorably burn in hell for his sins. The second option is not to blow up the building, but to send a detachment of armed Cossack formations there, which will arrest the Godless, and they will be brought to an honest trial. The third option is to arrange an ambush, and wait until the Godless leave the meeting and then arrest them."
transbaikalia.17.a:0 "Blow up the building!"
transbaikalia.17.b:0 "Send Cossack Divisions."
transbaikalia.17.c:0 "Set up an ambush."

transbaikalia.18.t:0 "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.18.d:0 "The demolition of the building turned into a complete disaster! It was successfully blown up, becoming a burial ground for several civilians, however, there was no meeting in the building. The informant who gave us the information turned out to be a traitor and set us up. While we were dealing with the blown-up house, we received information that the Militant Godless mobilized NRA partisans and captured some villages and towns in the Chita province. The partisans are approaching Chita, and we need to urgently organize a defense."
transbaikalia.18.a:0 "Protect the Chita approaches"
transbaikalia.18.b:0 "Defend the city center"

transbaikalia.19.t:0 "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.19.d:0 "The Cossack divisions sent by us broke into the building, but did not find any traces of the presence of the Godless. It seems that we were tricked. Moreover, the informant turned out to be a traitor who distracted our attention. While we were focusing on the building, the Godless mobilized partisan detachments and moved to Chita. We can only send the distracted divisions to the city center, where they will have time to meet with the NRA."
transbaikalia.19.a:0 "Send them to the city center!"

transbaikalia.20.t:0 "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.20.d:0 "Our ambush revealed that no meeting was actually held in the building. The informant was exposed and we successfully learned about the impending coup. The partisan cells near Chita were quickly discovered and destroyed as a result of a short battle. Moreover, the informant-traitor told about the real shelter of Yaroslavsky, to which a Cossack patrol arrived in order to arrest the sinner. He really was there, and was caught red-handed. By order of Ataman Semyenov, he will be executed in the coming days."
transbaikalia.20.a:0 "Finally we will deal with them."

transbaikalia.21.t:0 "Defending Chita"
transbaikalia.21.d:0 "The Cossack troops defending the approaches to Chita managed to withstand the onslaught of the partisans and successfully destroyed them. The city was saved. The informant who betrayed us, under torture, confessed to where Yaroslavsky's real refuge is located. A Cossack patrol arrived there in order to arrest the sinner. He really was there, and was caught red-handed. By order of Ataman Semyenov, he will be executed in the coming days."
transbaikalia.21.a:0 "Finally we will deal with them."

transbaikalia.22.t:0 "'Chita Slaughter'"
transbaikalia.22.d:0 "The Cossack detachments did not manage to get into the center of Chita in time. Already on the approaches to the city, they were ambushed by partisans who struck from the rear and destroyed one of our best divisions. The city was left virtually unprotected, and soon partisan detachments captured it. The situation in the Military District has become like anarchy, and according to rumors, Ataman Semyenov is preparing for a retaliatory strike, mobilizing Buryat-Mongolian divisions and the best Cossacks in Verkhneudinsk. However, with Chita under the control of Atheists, to whom factory workers have openly begun to join, our chances of success are extremely small."
transbaikalia.22.a:0 "Wait for them in Verkhneudinsk."
transbaikalia.22.b:0 "Quickly mobilize and try to recapture Chita."

transbaikalia.23.t:0 "Transbaikal Civil War"
transbaikalia.23.d:0 "A civil war has almost begun in Transbaikalia. With Chita under the control of the Godless and the NRA, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky himself came out of the shadows, declaring the victory of socialism in the Chita Labor Republic. Addressing the masses from the balcony of the Chita State Council, Yaroslavsky promised the citizens the immediate nationalization of resources and de-cossackization, as well as the liberation of the local population from the centuries-old slavery of capitalism. The industrial city, a major transport hub, was under the control of the partisans, and we were cut off from Vladivostok.\n\nHaving prepared the defense of Verkhneudinsk, Ataman Semyenov did not take into account only the fact that many Buryat-Mongols were completely unable to fight and were not ready for a civil war to break out in their region. Their political apathy led to the fact that many simply went home, not wanting to fight for the ataman, who had his own goals that did not meet the interests of the Buryat-Mongols.\n\nTogether with the NRA offensive on Verkhneudinsk, Ataman Semyenov was faced with a choice - to try to escape to wild Mongolia and stay there, surrendering Verkhneudinsk to the socialists, or to give the last fight. A fight that can be lost."

transbaikalia.24.d:0 "A civil war has almost begun in Transbaikalia. With Chita under the control of the Godless and the NRA, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky himself came out of the shadows, declaring the victory of socialism in the Chita Labor Republic. Addressing the masses from the balcony of the Chita State Council, Yaroslavsky promised the citizens the immediate nationalization of resources and de-cossackization, as well as the liberation of the local population from the centuries-old slavery of capitalism. The industrial city, a major transport hub, was under the control of the partisans, and we were cut off from Vladivostok.\n\nIn an unsuccessful attempt to capture Chita back, Ataman Semyenov made the main mistake, relying on the forces of the Buryat-Mongols. Many refused to go into battle for the ataman and deserted, leaving the Cossacks alone with the red partisans.\n\nThe Cossack troops were defeated, and their leader, Ataman Semyenov, was captured and arrested by the partisans. A few hours later, he was taken to Chita under escort, where he finally saw his enemy in the face. Yaroslavsky, surrounded by armed partisans, ordered the hanging of the enemy of the socialists as a war criminal on the main Chita Square, taking revenge on him for the long-term oppression of the socialists in the Far East.\n\nWith the death of Semyenov, the last minutes of the life of the Military District came, which was now under the full control of the NRA and the Godless."

transbaikalia.34.d:0 "Right now the Burnatskom, or the Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of Eastern Siberia, is nothing more than an advisory body, that claims to be the supreme institution of the Buryat-Mongols. Though it does not have any power comparable to the Ataman's, its influence among local Buryat-Mongols is increasing. Probably, we have to make more loyal people in charge of Burnatskom, as now it mostly consists of Buryat-Mongolian Socialists-Revolutionaries and they are motives cannot be clear for us.\n\nIn this case, Semyenov has several choices. The first one is to leave Burnatskom as it is, hoping it won't do any trouble to us. The second option is to lobby the Burnatskom to make Tsogto Badmazhapov, a national-democrat, who is sympathetic towards Cossacks, its Chairman. The third option is the most radical one: get rid of SR-led Burnatskom and place a Cossack as its head. Though this will probably provoke some local unrest, we can be sure in its loyalty."
transbaikalia.34.a:0 "Leave it as it is."

The situation is tense to the limit and it seems that clashes between protesters and Cossacks are about to begin. We can either try to settle everything in peace, or we can brutally suppress the protest and show who is the boss here."

transbaikalia.36.d:0 "Quite obviously, the protesters have demanded the retirement of the Cossack Burnatskom Chairman and restoration of Mikhail Bogdanov, a Buryat-Mongolian SR as the leader of Burnatskom. Though giving up will grant some sympathy towards our government and perhaps the incident will be resolved, we can still try to ask for a compromissable candidate - Tsogto Badmazhapov, a national-democrat, benevolent towards Cossacks."

transbaikalia.40.t:0 "The Unrest Escalates"
transbaikalia.40.d:0 "With the unwillingness of either side to go to reconciliation, discontent turned into riots and armed clashes.

It is brought to our attention that Ataman Semyenov is gathering his forces to march out of Transbaikalia and declare war on Kolchak. His plans include the creation of a full-fledged White Cossack state in the Russian Far East, the existence of which would be conditioned by Japanese patronage in exchange for simplified customs duties and gold. In return, the Japanese Empire undertakes to attack the Transamur in the event of the beginning of the offensive of the Transbaikal Cossacks."

transbaikalia.50.d:0 "By the creation of the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Republic, Semyenov means the endowment of its citizens with the rights and part of the duties of the Cossacks. Thus, the Buryat-Mongols will be able to use the traditional right of the Cossacks to own land. Forming the Buryat-Mongolian identity as a Cossack, Semyenov not only gives the Buryat-Mongols broad autonomy, but also offers them a successful option for implementing their national state. If the project is implemented, the Buryat-Mongols will most likely forever become part of a large Cossack family, but they will also receive their own developed armed forces and support from other atamans."

transbaikalia.50.b:0 "This what Buryat-Mongols need."


### Burnatskom Starting Events ###
burnatskom.1.t:0 "Burnatskom Consolidates Its Power"
burnatskom.1.d:0 "The Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of Eastern Siberia, or shortly Burnatskom, has now consolidated its power in the Transbaikal region. With the power finally in their hands, it is time to solve some important issues and convene the national parliament to hold the first free elections in Buryat-Mongolian history."
burnatskom.1.a:0 "Let's start!"

burnatskom.2.t:0 "The Matter of Religion"
burnatskom.2.d:0 "Buryat-Mongolia is a country of Buddhists and Buddhism has been practiced here for centuries. However, Burnatskom needs to make an important decision on the state status of religion, since representatives of other faiths live on our territory. Our subsequent policy towards the non-Buddhist minority, as well as State policy in the field of education and, possibly, even international relations, will depend on this decision.\n\nThe 4 parties that are members of the Burnatskom have different ideas about the future of Buddhism in Buryat-Mongolia. Buddhist socialists believe that Buddhism should not be the state religion, but nevertheless, socialist and Buddhist principles can be counted together, given the religious history of the people. The Buryat-Mongolian social revolutionaries advocate the secularization of Buddhist society and a gradual departure from Buddhist dogmas as the basic rules and norms of society. The National Democrats are in favor of giving Buddhism the status of a state religion, since it is inextricably linked with the Buryat-Mongolian people. Radical Buddhists believe that Buddhism should not just be a state religion, but new laws and regulations should be based only on religious dogmas, and monasteries should have political power."
burnatskom.2.a:0 "Endorse Buddhist Socialism idea."
burnatskom.2.b:0 "Secularize Buryat-Mongolia."
burnatskom.2.c:0 "Buddhism is our state religion."
burnatskom.2.e:0 "Buddhism should have an overwhelming influence."

burnatskom.3.t:0 "The Cossack Issue"
burnatskom.3.d:0 "It so happened that Transbaikalia is a home not only for the Buryat-Mongols, but also for the local Cossack army, which has its own rights and duties, as well as privileges. Thanks to the ten-year dominance of the Transbaikal Cossacks of Semyenov on the territory of Transbaikalia, many associates of the creation of the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack army, as well as the "cossackization" of the local population, appeared among the Buryat-Mongols. Such people were called "kazakomans". Nevertheless, the question of the Cossacks remains open for Burnatskom.\n\nThe opinion of the parties on this issue is also divided. Buddhist socialists believe that the Cossacks should not have any privileges, and, moreover, there should be a raskazachivanie and the abolition of the Transbaikal Cossack Host. The social revolutionaries support them in this regard, since as a result of the socialization of the land, the Cossacks will lose their monopoly on land ownership. At the same time, they are ready to make concessions and save the Transbaikal Cossack army. The National Democrats advocate the preservation of the Cossack class and closer cooperation with them for the sake of common peace. Radical Buddhists believe that the Cossack class should be destroyed and expelled from the territory of Buryat-Mongolia."
burnatskom.3.a:0 "Full decossackization"
burnatskom.3.b:0 "Cossack should lose their priveleges."
burnatskom.3.c:0 "Cooperation with Cossacks."
burnatskom.3.e:0 "Expel the cossacks from Buryat-Mongolia."

burnatskom.4.t:0 "Russian Minority"
burnatskom.4.d:0 "The lands of Buryat-Mongolia are the homeland of not only the local population, but also a fairly large number, but nevertheless, a minority of the Russian population.\n\nBuddhist socialists advocate the preservation of the status quo, that is, the absence of any privileges of the Russian population. Socialists-revolutionaries believe that a small autonomy should be created for the Russian population, and the Russians themselves should have the same rights and obligations as the Buryat Mongols. The National Democrats are in favor of depriving Russians of any privileges, since they now live in a national republic. Radical Buddhists are quite keen on this issue, believing that any resident of Buryat-Mongolia is obliged to profess Buddhism, and in case of refusal, should be extradited from the territory of the state."
burnatskom.4.a:0 "Status-quo."
burnatskom.4.b:0 "Small autonomy for Russians."
burnatskom.4.c:0 "Deprive Russians from any privileges."
burnatskom.4.e:0 "They should profess Buddhism or be extradited."

burnatskom.5.t:0 "Status of Land"
burnatskom.5.d:0 "An important issue discussed in Burnatsky was also the issue of land. Buddhist socialists and social revolutionaries are convinced that the land should be socialized and belong to society for the self-organization of the Buryat-Mongolian peasants. The National Democrats believe that private property should be preserved on the land for the sake of the development of capitalism in the country. Radical Buddhists advocate the transfer of land to monastic parishes, which will have the power to distribute this land among the population or even have it in their property."
burnatskom.5.a:0 "Socialization of land"
burnatskom.5.b:0 "Private land ownership"
burnatskom.5.c:0 "The land should belong to local Monasteries"

burnatskom.6.t:0 "Reviving Burnarduma"
burnatskom.6.d:0 "During the short existence of Buryat-Mongolia during the civil war, the Buryat-Mongolian People's Duma, the parliament, was established by the Burnatskom of those times. After the liberation of Transbaikalia from the Bolsheviks, the Burnatskom also formally recognized the regime of Semyenov and in November 1918 the committee was transformed into the Buryat-Mongolian People's Duma. Thus, in 1918-19, Burnatsky's policy was to prevent attempts to interfere in the process of establishing national autonomy by both the Soviet government and the White Regime. On January 23, 1919, the Burnarduma issued a decree on the mobilization of Buryat-Mongols into the army, in the ranks of the Mongol-Buryat brigade 'Zrikto-Bator' as part of the troops of Ataman Semyenov, about 2000 people were subject to mobilization. However, in the autumn of 1919, the Burnarduma was actually defeated due to disagreement with the policy of Ataman Semyenov. Since then, the Burnarduma has ceased to exist, and now it is time to restore it as a full-fledged parliament of our state."

Armed detachments, mainly consisting of NRA partisans, have captured several settlements near Verkhneudinsk today. Strongly opposed to the decision of the Burnatskom on the issue of religion, the SVB demands the immediate dispersal of the Committee, the establishment of the Transbaikal Soviet and transfer of the power to the workers and peasants. We need to fight back against the Godless before it's too late."

We have three options: the first is a blue-white-yellow tricolor with a Buryat-Mongolian soyombo; the second is the same tricolor, but vertical; the third is a dark blue canvas with an enlarged soyombo in the center."

bry.12.d:0 "The Transbaikal Cossacks are actually our neighbors in the region. For a long time, the Buryat Mongols and the Cossacks lived together, but this cohabitation on the same territory was not always beneficial and friendly. Our new government believes that if there was a feud, then it needs to end. The Transbaikal Cossacks will receive autonomy and retain their privileges, but in return they will have to defend our interests and fight on a par with our army."

bry.13.t:0 "Evaluating Our Policy Towards Russia"
bry.13.d:0 "Since the end of the civil war, relations between our people and the Russians have been strange. Hoping to get at least some autonomy, for 5 years after the end of the civil war, Burnatskom remained a temporary authority under the leadership of Bogdanov, and the elections in the region were constantly delayed. In 1925, when these lands were again seized by Ataman Semyenov and were annexed to Transamur, hopes for autonomy dried up for good. Now that we are independent again, it is time to decide what to do with our Russian neighbors."
bry.13.a:0 "We should work towards becoming Russian autonomy"

Religion is a regression, and from now on millions of beggars, whose lives have been ruined by faith, will not pray, but work for the good of the Motherland.\n\nAccording to the decree, the new ban applies to the entire territory of the former Russian Empire within the borders of 1914.

The Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of East Siberia, or Burnatskom, shall now organize a republican government so that some form of representation for the people can finally be established.

With the Militant Godless and Buddhist extremists at each other’s throats, and with the vast array of moderates caught in the middle, our council has been wracked by the inability to cooperate and agree on matters of the faith and faithless.

Though they have helped us in the past, they have also been responsible for our oppression and the degradation of Buryat culture. A final stance on these rough riders of the Steppe must be made before our provisional government can give way to a true republic."

From the age of the old tsars to the rise of Transamur and the splitting of the old empire in the wake of the Weltkrieg, these Slavs have lorded over us as friends, as enemies, as oppressors, and as liberators. This unique and varied history has left our people with many mixed feelings about the sizable Russian minority that exists within new Buryatia.

Claiming Buddhism to be only a tool of oppression and control, the SVB has villainized both the Buddhist clergy and the laity, and seek to rid Buryatia entirely of this wretched influence while also rapidly militarizing the nation to serve as a barrier to keep our revolution safe.

The resources and mineral wealth of the nation shall be collectively owned by everyone in the nation, with control of its allocation going to the government. Large, successful, and modernized farmlands that already exist are to be converted into model farms and staffed by our best farmers. The right to use the newly nationalized land is to be guaranteed to all citizens, with many more clauses being listed in the full document.

No longer can the rough-hewn hands of the peasantry - the very peasantry that forms the largest foundation of our society - be left to support our entire nation without anything in return. Through new pro-worker and lower class legislations and policies, as well as a new campaign from the government aimed at improving the wider image of these ‘dirty’ laborers, we shall build a new Buryat man for all to aspire to - the humble but noble and ever important peasant with whom our entire destiny lies."

These entrepreneurs and captains of industry, though small in number, would be vital to creating a stable market-based economy here in Buryatia.

Though Moscow feels like a world away, Siberia is just a stone’s throw from our borders, and with their proximity and power, they could either prove to be a great ally or a nearly unbeatable enemy.

BRY_Theocratic_State_desc:0 "Emphasizing his Buddhist faith and dedication to the philosophy it entails, our national leader Bidia Dandaron has proclaimed that Buryatia is to be reforged into a true theocracy, with himself ascending to a position similar to the Bogd Khan of Mongolia. Rising to become the new religious, political, and military leader of this Kodun State, ‘Lama Dandaron’ shall guide every facet of our reforged and pious nation into a prosperous and pious future."

BRY_Fight_The_Cossacks:0 "Fight the Cossacks"
BRY_Fight_The_Cossacks_desc:0 "The cossacks have long pervaded this nation like a tumor, copying our nomadic lifestyle while living as disgraceful bandits. We must work to purify their ranks, converting the few that we can while fiercely combatting those we cannot in order to stop their vile influence from pervading throughout our society. Through faith and flame, sword and shot, these rough riders shall be purged from our new Buryatia so that we may prosper as a homogenous and united people."

BRY_Empower_The_Monasteries:0 "Empower the Monasteries"
BRY_Empower_The_Monasteries_desc:0 "The various monasteries across Buryatia form a key facet of both our cultural society as well as our political administration. As our strongest allies and closest supporters, they shall be empowered and granted far greater autonomy and freedoms, both allowing them to function more as they see fit while also giving them greater sway within the government. With our ideals aligning more and more, this shouldn’t be an issue, and with larger monasteries such as Tamchinsky Datsan and Hambyn-Hire Datsan rising to become strongholds for our party, we have no worries about their loyalty."

BRY_Neobuddhism:0 "Neobuddhism"
BRY_Neobuddhism_desc:0 "Promoted by Bidia Dandaron, ‘Neobuddhism’ is a new strain of thought calling for a synthesis of Buddhist religious practice and tradition with the politics, economics, culture, and wider society of the nation itself. Essentially the complete opposite of Western Secularization programs, Neobuddhism seeks to fully integrate the Buddhist Church as not only an aspect of our society, but as the wider foundation of it that all other facets link back and relate to. Fiercely popular among much of the lower classes who view it as their ticket into a more pure, just, and pious society, the movement has already begun to spread like wildfire, and soon it shall hopefully come to consume all of Buryatia, furthering our transformation into a true theocracy."

BRY_Greater_Buryat_Mongolia:0 "Greater Buryat-Mongolia"
BRY_Greater_Buryat_Mongolia_desc:0 "Placing emphasis on our distinct Buryat heritage while pushing for Panmongol ideas is no easy task given the great influence of the Southern Mongolias in Ulaanbaatar, but it is our destiny. We shall be the ones to unite the Mongolic race. We shall be the ones to wrap the Mongolic peoples in the embrace of Neobuddhism as we uplift the Buryat-Mongols specifically as an exemplary people. Panmongolism will be achieved at all costs, and our Buryat identity shall finally get the recognition is so rightfully deserves!"

BRY_Buddhist_Brethren:0 "Join Our Buddhist Brethren"
BRY_Buddhist_Brethren_desc:0 "Though national unity is a great dream, it would only serve to  muddy our distinct yet linked identities as the varied and mighty Mongolic peoples. Instead, we shall pursue close diplomatic, martial, and economic ties with our Mongolian brethren instead, so that both of our nations may reach prosperity together without either of our specific peoples being trampled beneath the other."

BRY_Support_Buryat_Autonomy:0 "Support Buryat Autonomy"
BRY_Support_Buryat_Autonomy_desc:0 "Though cossacks reign supreme here in Buryatia now, that is no excuse to oppress these people who have long been our allies. The Buryat-Mongols shall be given their long-promised autonomy, and be spared from the raids of our men. They shall be protected by our Host and nurtured, allowed to rule their own as they see fit and allowed to ride across and live on the lands that they have done so on for centuries before our arrival."

BRY_Create_Buryat_Cossack_Host:0 "Create Buryat Cossack Host"
BRY_Create_Buryat_Cossack_Host_desc:0 "To foster closer cooperation between our cossacks and the Buryats, Ataman Semyenov has called for the creation of a true Buryat Host. This would make all Buryats honorary cossacks, and slowly introduce them to our culture and beliefs. Over time, they hopefully will take in some aspects of this culture, creating a new syncretic identity loyal to our Ataman."

BRY_Anti_Socialist_Raids:0 "Anti-Socialist Raids"
BRY_Anti_Socialist_Raids_desc:0 "Socialism is a cancer. It snakes its way into the brains of the downtrodden, filling their heads with false promises and unachievable dreams of utopia. We must cease the call of these siren’s, and the easiest way to do so is to raid their meeting places and properties until all those guilty can be arrested, their works destroyed, and their radical taint eliminated for good."

BRY_Ally_Mongolia:0 "Mongolian Allies"
BRY_Ally_Mongolia_desc:0 "To the south lies Mongolia proper - a vast nation surrounding the Steppe and the Gobi, filled with potential and danger. Despite our differences, they are our natural ally out here in the Far-East, for we both oppose the ambitions of the greater powers around us, instead pushing for our own. These kindred spirits would make excellent allies as we both strive to bring greatness to our nations."

BRY_Loyal_Burnatskom:0 "Loyal Burnatskom"
BRY_Loyal_Burnatskom_desc:0 "In order to appease our Buryat allies, who vastly outnumber us out here in the heartland of Buryatia, Ataman Semyenov has expressed his interest in reviving Burnatskom. Short for the Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of East Siberia, Burnatskom is a united council of Buryat political, religious, and military figures who come together to represent Buryat interests. We shall revive and shackle this council to our Host, allowing them to be the voice for the Buryats within our nation, giving them some sense of national representation."

BRY_Buryat_Mongol_Cavalry:0 "Buryat-Mongol Cavalry"
BRY_Buryat_Mongol_Cavalry_desc:0 "Pulling from our Buryat allies once more, we shall move to incorporate their vast number of able horse riders into our army, for their skill in the saddle is nearly unmatched anywhere else in the world. These expert riders shall form the core of our elite cavalry corps, serving as shock troops and vanguard units to our main force."

BRY_Connections_With_Japanese:0 "Connections With the Japanese"
BRY_Connections_With_Japanese_desc:0 "Despite their ambition, the Empire of the Rising Sun is our only hope to combat Russian dominance in the Far-East. Calling on old ties through Ataman Semyenov, an audience with the Emperor’s court in Tokyo has been scheduled, where we shall attempt to garner their favor and their aid without losing our hard-fought sovereignty."

BRY_Ignore_Banditry:0 "Ignore Banditry"
BRY_Ignore_Banditry_desc:0 "Banditry is part of cossack life. Supplies, loot, food, weapons, clothing, money, and everything else our cossacks use is frequently sourced from raids and bandit action. Though this angers many within our lands, it also is necessary for our Host to function, for raiding doesn’t just put food on the table, it also puts the love of life and high spirits in the hearts of all our riders. We will suggest to our men to raid outside our borders instead, but shall overall turn a blind eye to these actions, unless they grow too out of hand."

BRY_Buryat_Cossack_Republic:0 "Buryat Cossack Republic"
BRY_Buryat_Cossack_Republic_desc:0 "With our new Host solidified and and our new regime consolidated, Ataman Semyenov has moved to proclaim the Buryat Cossack Republic of the Far-East. Though far from democratic and with most power residing with the hands of the Ataman, this new state still puts the needs and desires of its varied peoples first - whether they be cossack or Buryat. With the people having free local government and our national administration standing resolute with a powerful army at its back, our new state is the pride of Semyenov and one of the first semi-representational states in the region. Though our destiny is far from complete, our nation and our peoples have come a long way."

BRY_Liberate_The_Far_East_Cossack:0 "Liberate the Far-East"
BRY_Liberate_The_Far_East_Cossack_desc:0 "Now is the time we ride for our destiny, deep and far across the frozen Far-East. Our Host shall charge into this new dawning age of cossack dominance, and under Ataman Semyenov’s wise and calculated command, we shall be victorious! We shall liberate the Far-East and from the ashes of Russian and Japanese ambition, we shall carve out our own Cossack Republic as we face the rising sun head on to claim our birthright."

BRY_Army:0 "Form the Buryat People's Army"
BRY_Army_desc:0 "To protect our newly sovereign nation and to eventually project our own ambitions, we will need a well-tuned and veteran army in order to do so. To this end, the Buryat People’s Army shall rise, and under their watch, Buryatia shall be kept safe from any and all threats - no matter if they are foreign or domestic."

BRY_Develop_A_National_Doctrine:0 "Develop a National Doctrine"
BRY_Develop_A_National_Doctrine_desc:0 "To have an army is not enough, for if they are not trained in modern tactics and strategies, they are nothing more than armed rabble ready to be mowed down by machine gun fire. We must develop a new national doctrine that takes into account our environment and our realities, and then utilize these ideas as the foundation for our military’s training."

BRY_Rely_On_Cossacks:0 "Rely on Cossacks"
BRY_Rely_On_Cossacks_desc:0 "The cossacks are a rowdy and sometimes untrustworthy bunch, but their skill in the saddle and behind a rifle is nothing to ignore. We shall conscript them into our ranks to serve as veteran cavalrymen and shock troops, bolstering our army’s proficiency even further."

BRY_Use_The_Nomadic_Legacy:0 "Harken to Our Nomadic Legacy"
BRY_Use_The_Nomadic_Legacy_desc:0 "As Mongols, nomadism is in our blood. Though not conducive to modern urban living, nomadic traditions are useful for their military applications. With an intimate knowledge of the land around them and how to live off of it, nomads make ideal soldiers. They shall be taken in as teachers, as officers, and as veterans where they can put their knowledge to good use for the state."

BRY_Lessons_Of_Siberian_Army:0 "Lessons of the Siberian Army"
BRY_Lessons_Of_Siberian_Army_desc:0 "The Siberian Army of the Russian Civil War earned many victories against the Reds, and regardless of our views today, their martial skill cannot be denied. We should move to emulate their doctrine as masters of winter and tundra warfare. We too shall rise to be masters of these wastes."

BRY_Buryat_Officer_School:0 "Buryat Officer School"
BRY_Buryat_Officer_School_desc:0 "In order to train a new generation of native officers, a local officer academy shall be built in the capital. Here, we shall finally have a center of higher military education capable of training our own general staff, with our nation no longer forced to rely on foreign expertise."

BRY_Rally_The_Masses:0 "Rally the Masses"
BRY_Rally_The_Masses_desc:0 "For any war to be won, the masses must be behind the nation and the army lest the whole nation collapse. As we move to build up our military, we must also instill a deep sense of patriotism and respect within the populace towards our men in uniform. Who knows, this may even get more to volunteer for our ever hungry armed forces."

BRY_Improve_Artillery:0 "Improve Our Artillery"
BRY_Improve_Artillery_desc:0 "Much of our heavy guns and canons are relics of the Weltkrieg or are museum pieces ransacked and pushed into service out of necessity. By studying more modern designs from Russia and Japan, we shall modernize our artillery corps so that we may rain down heavy ordinance upon any foe."

BRY_Increase_Military_Spendings:0 "Increase Military Spendings"
BRY_Increase_Military_Spendings_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex is an ever growing and ever hungry machine. In order to fuel this rampant growth, we must allocate more of the national budget towards the armed forces. Though other sectors of our society may take a slight hit, it is worth it for national security."

BRY_Buryat_Mongol_Cavalry_Army:0 "Buryat-Mongol Cavalry"
BRY_Buryat_Mongol_Cavalry_Army_desc:0 "The Buryat-Mongols have a long history of cavalry warfare and should form the basis of our fast-attack troops. Though they still ride flesh and blood horses with more archaic weaponry, they are deadly effective and lightning quick while simultaneously able to live entirely off the land, reducing supply consumption. They shall be the backbone of our new doctrine."

BRY_Modernized_Cavalry:0 "Modernized Cavalry"
BRY_Modernized_Cavalry_desc:0 "Though troops on horseback are the basis of our martial tradition, they have little place in a modern army. Instead, their tactics and traditions shall be translated to new, modernized divisions utilizing the latest armored vehicles in order to get similar results. The cavalry of the past shall fold before the cavalry of the future!"

BRY_Mechanization:0 "Mechanization of Cossacks"
BRY_Mechanization_desc:0 "In order to improve the combat effectiveness of our recruited cossack warriors, we shall replace many of their horses with mechanized and motorized vehicles. Though this might cut their speed and their flexibility on rough terrain or when without supply, they shall be far more effective at fighting in this modern style of warfare that has become the dominant form of combat."

BRY_True_Heirs_Of_Gengis_Khan:0 "True Heirs of Genghis Khan"
BRY_True_Heirs_Of_Gengis_Khan_desc:0 "We are the sons of Temujin, the heirs of Genghis and his children. His martial talent, his traditions, and his successes flow through our veins as true heirs of the Mongol Empire. We shall tap into this martial spirit and tradition and channel the might of Temujin directly. We shall be his heirs, and we shall make our national hero proud."

BRY_Socialist_Army:0 "People's Revolutionary Army"
BRY_Socialist_Army_desc:0 "In order to safeguard the revolution, the People’s Revolutionary Army shall rise to take the place of the disorganized militias that have served our movement thus far. This professional army shall take time to develop and train, but it shall be worth it as a guarantee of national sovereignty."

BRY_From_Militia_To_Army:0 "From Militia to Army"
BRY_From_Militia_To_Army_desc:0 "We must transform the disorganized yet experienced rabble that makes up our militias into an effective, modern, and professional military. Through total mobilization and thorough training, we shall forge the PRA into the stalwart sword and shield that defends both our revolution and the Buryat proletariat without fail."

BRY_Conscript_Buryats:0 "Conscript Buryats"
BRY_Conscript_Buryats_desc:0 "In order to fill the ranks of our growing military, conscription must go into effect, and who better to recruit for our army than our own people. The Buryat people are hardy, and shall form a sturdy, reliable foundation for our manpower pool."

BRY_Centralized_Command:0 "Centralized Command"
BRY_Centralized_Command_desc:0 "In order to better defend the revolution and to better command our quickly-growing army, our administration has pushed to create a centralized command hierarchy directly keyed into party leadership. With our government and our military staff working in concert with one another, there shall be no room for mistakes and no room for errors caused by mismanagement or lack of attention, for from this lofty hierarchy, our generals and commanders shall see and control it all."

BRY_Reorganize_Armament_Production:0 "Reorganize Armament Production"
BRY_Reorganize_Armament_Production_desc:0 "Every man in our army needs a rifle, and we cannot keep requisitioning them from scavenging operations or from the dusty old storerooms of foreign powers. We must create a domestic gunsmithing industry here in Buryatia so that no soldier within our army ever needs for a rifle or some ammunition to defend the nation with."

BRY_Dedicated_Artillery_Batalions:0 "Dedicated Artillery Battalions"
BRY_Dedicated_Artillery_Batalions_desc:0 "In order to effectively fight in modern war, combined arms tactics must be utilized, and the easiest additional ‘arm’ to give our infantry is heavy artillery. Independent artillery battalions giving support to our troops shall aid any future war effort greatly. We shall split the skies and rain hell down upon our enemies with these newly created or purchased gun batteries, showing all who dare to mess with Buryatia that we have the means to defend ourselves, so if any dare assault our bastion, they best be ready to face the fire of our heavy guns."

BRY_Encircled_By_Enemies:0 "Encircled by Enemies"
BRY_Encircled_By_Enemies_desc:0 "We are surrounded on all sides by enemies of the revolution who only seek to consume and devour our nation and our people. We must fortify and dig-in, never faltering in our watch as the rest of the world eyes us with hungry looks and greedy ambition. Buryatia shall stand for a thousand years, and our dedicated armies shall ensure this reality!"

BRY_Air:0 "Form the Buryat Air Forces"
BRY_Air_desc:0 "We shall fill the skies with metal birds of prey in order to protect our newly-freed state. No longer shall the simple hawks, falcons, and songbirds of Buryatia inhabit our skies alone, for soon with the creation of our own airforce, we too shall take flight in order to preserve the nation and our sovereignty."

BRY_Buy_Japanese_Planes:0 "Purchase Japanese Planes"
BRY_Buy_Japanese_Planes_desc:0 "We lack much of the heavy industry and resources needed to develop our own planes from scratch. However, just next door is Japan who is always eager to sell their arms to fellow Eastern nations in need - especially when those nations oppose Japan’s many enemies. We shall reach out to Tokyo and buy as many aircraft as they’ll allow, giving our air programme a jumpstart."

BRY_Use_The_Russian_Knowledge:0 "Utilize Russian Knowledge"
BRY_Use_The_Russian_Knowledge_desc:0 "Though the Russians are largely reviled here, you cannot ignore their amazing aptitude for war. By pulling designs and ideas from the Russian air force, we shall further hone our own force into a far more effective arm of the military."

BRY_Buryat_Air_Academy:0 "Buryat Air Academy"
BRY_Buryat_Air_Academy_desc:0 "In order to train our pilots natively without the need for help from foreign powers, we must construct our own air academy here in Buryatia. Serving as a flight school, an officer academy, and a research and development center all in one, this new academy shall become the centerpiece of our attempts to rule the skies."

BRY_Expand_The_Airfields:0 "Expand Our Airfields"
BRY_Expand_The_Airfields_desc:0 "The airfields in Buryatia are few and far between, with those few paved ones built by the Russians being far outnumbered by simple stips of prairie cordoned off for take-off and landings. We must rectify this reality immediately and construct a new series of permanent airfields across Buryatia. Without these landingstrips and hangars, our air force shall remain largely grounded."

BRY_Air_Force_Investment:0 "Air Force Investments"
BRY_Air_Force_Investment_desc:0 "With the first developments coming along well, our administration has now found it agreeable to expand the air force further. The initial creation of this branch has gone well, but now it requires more funding to truly be effective. We shall grant out flyboys these funds, for they are the new swift riders of Buryatia, and upon their wings they carry our future and security."

BRY_Improve_Air_Fleet:0 "Improve Our Air Fleet"
BRY_Improve_Air_Fleet_desc:0 "Though our imports from Russia and Japan have served us well, our air force needs to be expanded with domestically-produced aircraft. We must improve the air fleet with better, more innovative designs while building it all within our borders so that we can finally have total military independence and proficiency."

BRY_Seek_International_Recognition:0 "Seek International Recognition"
BRY_Seek_International_Recognition_desc:0 "We are a new and relatively illegitimate state in the eyes of the wider international community. With our army modernized and our state secured, we should push for closer diplomatic ties with the Great Powers so that all come to recognize and respect our hard-fought sovereignty."
