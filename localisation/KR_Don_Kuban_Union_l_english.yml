POLITICS_PETR_KRASNOV_DESC:0 "The Krasnov Clan is perhaps the most famous among the Don Cossacks, its members have been generals, officers and intellectuals, and Pyetr Krasnov was just the most recent manifestation of this heritage. Though raised as a Cossack, Krasnov is extremely well read - he holds great interest in literature and writes fiction, has studied the nations of the Far East and Africa while serving in the Life Guards Ataman Regiment, and was even an acquaintance of Tsar Nikolay II himself. Having risen to lead the Regiment, he swore fealty to the Provisional Government, but did not hold warm feelings towards it, and so chose to not save Kerensky during the October Revolution. When he arrived back to his home in the Don Host, he was elected their Ataman and announced a crusade against the revolution in the north.\n\nThe Don Cossacks would prove to be the most loyal and effective force among the South Russian Whites, and periodically received German support, which the Ataman did not forget. Once the Bolshevik revolution concluded, Krasnov returned to his Host, but the Republic in Moscow did not leave him satisfied. The Tsar was nowhere close to being restored, the Republic itself was weak, and Krasnov personally despised Kerensky. During the Kolchak Coup of 1925, he decided to strike. Supported by German arms and a clique of loyal officers, he organized his own putsch in Rostov-on-Don, moved onto the rest of the Don-Caucasian region, and cut all ties with the regime in Moscow. The Kaiser's support meant that Russia was forced to back down, although it claims the region to this day. Krasnov continues to run the clique as a personalistic regime, suppressing all of Kuban Host's calls for union with Ukraine and keeping the North Caucasian tribes down. For now..."

### Focus ###

DKB_after:0 "Black Monday Reaction"
DKB_after_desc:0 "The Berlin Stock Market has crashed, causing shock waves to ripple around the entire world. Those shock waves have finally hit the Don Republic. We must deal with Black Monday, and how we go about doing that may just change the course of the Don Republic forever..."

DKB_ataman:0 "Increased Cooperation with Germany"
DKB_ataman_desc:0 "In these times of great economic strife, calls for the Don Republic to leave the German Sphere, and go forwards on our own are growing by the day. However, if we truly wish to remain free of the talons of Russia, we must not only stick with Germany, but increase our ties, to be closer then ever before."
DKB_voennya_sdelka:0 "Military Deal With Germany"
DKB_voennya_sdelka_desc:0 "As one of the first steps in our journey for closer ties with the Kaiserreich, members of our government have suggested reaching out to Germany for aid with military matters. After all, we may soon find ourselves as the newest section of Germany's Eastern Flank, making military aid against the Sleeping Bear all but a necessity. "
DKB_german_officer:0 "Invite German Officers"
DKB_german_officer_desc:0 "As we begin the modernization of our armed forces along German lines, the first and perhaps most obvious step is to invite German officers to our nation. With this first step underway, our armed forces will soon be the envy of the Caucasus!"
DKB_ger_partner:0 "Partnership With Germany"
DKB_ger_partner_desc:0 "With our German ties closer then ever, the time has come for a formal treaty of partnership with the German Empire. While this will basically only be putting on paper what is already a reality, it is a necessary step if our relationship with Germany is too progress further."
DKB_german_nayka:0 "Scientific Cooperation With the Germans"
DKB_german_nayka_desc:0 "As we grow ever closer to Germany, the next logical step is to increase scientific cooperation with the Kasierreich. By doing this, not only will we gain access to the cutting edge of German research, but our own scientific minds that would otherwise go unnoticed by the world will have the chance to prove their intelligence!"
DKB_make_administration:0 "Krupp Investments"
DKB_make_administration_desc:0 "As we work ever closer with Germany to battle the effects of Black Monday, an interesting letter has crossed the desk of [DKB.GetLeader]. Krupp, the Germany armaments company, has formally request a large (but temporary) tax break. In change for such a break, they would be willing to substantially invest in the Don Republic. For course this comes with the risk of even more German control of our nation, but that is a small risk compared to the reward..." 
DKB_progerman_politic:0 "Pro-German Politics"
DKB_progerman_politic_desc:0 "With German agreement to aid us in rebuilding our economy following Black Monday, the time has come to finally codify what has so long been the case. Germany is our most important ally, economically, politically and militarily. It was solely due to Germany that we have been free of the Bear to our north for so long, and it shall be with Germany that we remain free!"
DKB_ger_ammo:0 "Import German Equipment"
DKB_ger_ammo_desc:0 "The armed forces of the Don Republic, with the aid of German officers, are looking more and more like the Heer by the day. However, one thing is stopping them from fully looking like their German counterparts: equipment. To rectify this, the government has approved a mass shipment of German equipment. Soon our boys will not only fight like the Germans, but will have the same guns!"
DKB_KONR:0 "KONR"
DKB_KONR_desc:0 "The Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia is a body that has existed almost as long as the Petrograd Regime itself. Formed by those in opposition to Kerensky with German backing (due to Kerensky's  socialist leanings), the committee has existed in a state of limbo since the attempted assassination of Kerensky a short time ago. At German urging, and to gain the Don Republic’s backing as we stake our bets in opposition to Russia, the Committee shall formally be invited to the Don Republic. This will allow them to both operate closer to Russia itself and to bolster our own legitimacy when the inevitable war with Russia comes."
DKB_ostlegonien:0 "Form the Ostlegionen"
DKB_ostlegonien_desc:0 "As our armed forces are evermore Germanized, a great problem and yet perhaps even a great solution has shown itself. All throughout the Don Republic, there are seemly countless ethnic minorities, all who, while loyal to the Republic, fear joining the army due to it's over cossackization. At the suggestion of Germany, these minorities are to be formed into the first so-called Ostlegionen, a division that will take any man, regardless of ethnicity into it's ranks."
DKB_ger_traning:0 "German Tactics Training"
DKB_ger_traning_desc:0 "With our armed forces moving ever closer to the German standred, the time has come atlast for training in German tactcis. All our efforts have led up to this, and with this completed, we will finally have a modern, German-style army!"
DKB_ROA:0 "ROA"
DKB_ROA_desc:0 "With the Committee for the Liberation of the People's of Russia now firmly established with the Don Republic, the time has come for the next phase of the Committee's plan to liberate Russia from the ghost of Kerensky.  The Committee has approved the creation of the Russian Liberation Army, which in essence is little more than our own armed forces, although bolstered by Russian defectors and some more... rowdy German battalions. Regardless, the Russian Liberation Army shall be the bulwark against Russian imperialism and be the first soldiers of a truly free Russia."
DKB_propoganda:0 "Propaganda"
DKB_propoganda_desc:0 "With the KONR and ROA quickly becoming more and more entrenched within the Don (even superseding the government on certain levels), there is one massive problem that must be addressed. Namely, the people don't view either the KNOR or ROA as legitimate. They see both as an attempt by Germany to completely overtake our local government. This is simple not true! To teach the people the truth about our necessary contact and ties with Germany, the government has approved a campaign to teach the people the truth. While some will call this a propaganda campaign, they are clear wrong. We are simply teaching the truth, our truth."
DKB_new_patriot:0 "Gleichschaltung"
DKB_new_patriot_desc:0 "With the people finally accepting the truth in regards to our German allies, the German Administration present within our country has proposed a radical idea. They call it 'Gleichschaltung' or 'Coordination'. In essence, the plan would slowly begin to eat away at local institutions, the media, and even the economy to fully unite the nation under one vision. While indeed this proposal is radical and would be highly unpopular should it be discovered, the potential befit to our national stability is too good to pass up, even if it may give the Germans unprecedented control over the country."
DKB_form_base:0 "Rostow Militärbezirk"
DKB_form_base_desc:0 "With German influence even greater in the Don, our contacts within the German Heer have proposed a plan that may just change the region forever. They call it the Rostow Militärbezirk or Rostow Military District: in essence, the plan would turn the current attache into a full blown station of the Heer in Eastern Europe. While perhaps problematic and a possible sign of things to come, due to the amount of German influence within the Don, we can do nothing but smile and nod, lest the Heer turn their guns towards us and install a more friendly regime in our place."
DKB_fol_pol:0 "Foreign Policy"
DKB_fol_pol_desc:0 "With Black Monday finally behind us and the Heer fully supporting our government, the time has come to begin expanding the Don Republic to the furthest reaches of the Caucasus. The journey ahead will be hard, and much blood will be spilled, but in the end it will all be worth it."
DKB_annex_kuban:0 "Annex Kuban"
DKB_annex_kuban_desc:0 "The Kuban People's Republic has long been a thorn in the side of the Don government. With German backing, we will make short work of this thorn, at last."
DKB_annex_kalmykia:0 "Annex Kalmykia"
DKB_annex_kalmykia_desc:0 "Breaking off from us following Black Monday, the treacherous government of Kalmykia has been a target since their deceleration of independence. With aid from the Heer, there is no doubt we will be able to deal with these up starts as fast as they left the Republic."
DKB_annex_causasus:0 "Annex the Mountain Republic"
DKB_annex_causasus_desc:0 "The Mountain Republic has existed since it declared Independence from Russia following the Russian Revolution in 1917. While it was Germany that kept the Mountain Republic alive from the Russian Bear, it shall be German arms in Cossack hands that puts the Republic down."
DKB_automonic_state:0 "Proclaim an Autonomous State"
DKB_automonic_state_desc:0 "German influence can be felt on every level of our government, from the lowest tax collector to the High Command. German Marks fuel our economy, German gas drives our trucks, and German hands control the strings of power. Only one man remains to prevent total German control over the Don: Ataman Krasnov. That man will be made to bend to the German will or he will be... dealt with. And, once he is gone?

dkb.1.d:0 "The Don Republic was proclaimed by Pyetr Krasnov on the 18th of May, 1918, when he was elected as the 'Ataman' ('Leader') of the Don Cossacks. Since then, Krasnov, who used to be a connecting link between the leadership of the White Army and the Germans, started to strengthen his regime in southern Russia by improving his relations with the separatist leaders of the Kuban and Terek Cossacks. With the German help, the Don-Kuban Union could finally break away from Russia, which Krasnov as the Ataman of the Union condemned for its new republican system, using the conservative and pro-monarchist feelings of the South Russian population. But, the newly established Union still has to face lots of problems. The lack of modern industry weakens the army of the Union, the people want land redistribution and reunification with Russia, and separatist tensions in various parts of the Caucasus grow. If Pyetr Krasnov wants to stay as the Ataman of the Don Republic, he will have to deal with all these problems in his country."

dkb.3.d:0 "As predicted, the Don's finances and economy are in deep crisis. The average Cossack faces problems selling his products, and a number of factories are closing. This means that various dangerous elements will have a greater impact upon the political landscape of the Cossack country."
dkb.3.a:0 "God save us from the worst."

dkb.4.t:0 "The Germans Withdraw Capital"
dkb.4.d:0 "Various German businessmen and investors are withdrawing money from the Caucasus. Krasnov is loosing his political power as more and more Cossack are looking towards a union with Russia."
dkb.4.a:0 "Damn."

dkb.5.t:0 "Kalmykia Secedes"

dkb.6.t:0 "Bogaevsky Criticize Krasnov"
dkb.6.d:0 "Bogaevsky, the leader of the pro-Russian faction in the Cossack Circle has criticized Krasnov and denounced his policy of appeasing the Germans. With the Berlin Stock Crisis and Germany slowly loosing its supreme role in world politics, cooperation with them won't bring stability to the country like it may have a few years ago."
dkb.6.a:0 "He's only talking."

dkb.7.t:0 "Radicalization of the Circle"
dkb.7.d:0 "After Bogaevsky's speech, the Cossack Circle has quickly become a rhetorical battlefield between pro-German and pro-Russian factions. Even if the Circle is not a parliament in any sense, they will have to negotiate and choose a side."
dkb.7.a:0 "Support Bogaevsky - Russia is an ally we need."
dkb.7.b:0 "Support Krasnov - Germany will protect us."

dkb.8.t:0 "Clashes in Rostov"
dkb.8.d:0 "Since the Circle decided to support Krasnov, Bogaevsky has been vigorously opposing the organization. To this end, almost all the pro-Russian cossacks have left the Circle. Even worse, yesterday saw violence on the streets of Rostov between Bogaevsky's and Krasnov's cossacks; we must immediately stop the civil unrest."

dkb.9.b:0 "Try to negotiate with Krasnov."

dkb.10.t:0 "Bogaevsky's Coup"
dkb.10.d:0 "It was impossible to negotiate with already radicalized Cossacks. In order to prevent further bloodshed, Afrikan Bogaevsky, with the help of loyal cossacks, has seized the administrative buildings in Rostov. Krasnov has been arrested and Bogaevsky was proclaimed the new ataman by the loyal Cossack Circle. It is over!"
dkb.10.a:0 "Glory to Bogaevsky!"

dkb.11.t:0 "Krasnov Secures His Power"
dkb.11.d:0 "The militia of Bogaevsky has finally been crushed with their leader arrested. Krasnov consolidated his grip over the Don Republic and stayed as the ataman. Now, the Republic will face further cooperation with Germany."
dkb.11.a:0 "Glory to Krasnov!"

dkb.12.t:0 "'And Quiet Flows the Don'"
dkb.12.d:0 "A prominent young author, Mikhail Sholokhov, has published his monumental novel: 'And Quiet Flows the Don'. It tells a story about the Don Cossacks in the First World War and the Civil War, which combines several storylines. A conservative writer who was on the side of the Whites during the Civil War, Sholokhov devotes a significant place in the novel to the Red Cossacks, and his main character, Grigory Melekhov, at the end of the story never 'comes to the Whites'. While the novel received a lot of criticism for its pro-socialist ideology, many consider it to be a reaction towards Russian post-war policy. The novel is going to be translated into German, French, and English and is predicted to become a bestseller among leftist and rightist readers alike."
dkb.12.a:0 "A great book!"

dkb.13.t:0 "Dawn of the Red Don"
dkb.13.d:0 "The Don Republic has been finally liberated from the yokes of the capitalism. The Don People's Socialist Party, led by Chairman Syrtsov, with the help of Budyonny's Red Cossacks has finally achieved the victory in the long class war against rich Cossacks, who were too busy serving German capital to stop us. Many things should be done before we are strong enough to defend our borders from an invasion, but the groundwork is now laid for such an effort. The dawn of a new socialist republic has begun - and it will end only with the river Don painted dark red with our workers' blood. Regardless, we will fight and endure the rigours of this violent capitalist world."
dkb.13.a:0 "A good start."

dkb.14.t:0 "Syrtsov Delivers Speech"
dkb.14.d:0 "Prime-Minister of our republic, Sergey Syrtsov, has delivered a speech in the centre of Rostov, in front of a square, crowded with workers and peasants. As Syrtsov observed the crowd, he noted that 'hard times are coming, comrades. We should be more consolidated nowadays. We are surrounded by enemies, but a bright future for our nation is near.

dkb.16.d:0 "Sergey Syrtsov, prime-minister of our government, has proclaimed that even if our republic to become the successor of the first proletarian state, thought to be lost in the history books, but now remembered widely in our nation. The legacy of Lenin lives on, and his last hopes are concentrated in the hearts of fellow comrades, who live on the banks of the river Don."
dkb.16.a:0 "Let the world hear."

dkb.17.t:0 "Red Cossacks"
dkb.17.d:0 "During the Russian Civil War, the south of Russia was a great battlefield for all the sides. Here General Kornilov led the Volunteer Army, Denikin and Wrangel competed for the control of the South Russian Front, and, finally, our comrades established various Soviet republics. Premier Syrtsov still remembers these times when he served as a Commissioner for National Economy and vice-chairman of the Don Soviet Republic. A lot of time has passed since those days, and now the Red Cossacks of Semyon Budyonny lead the second Socialist Republic in Don. He will never forget the help of the cossacks that supported the Soviet power in this region. The so-called 'Red Cossacks' will help us this time as well - the cossacks are still respected in our population - and they will be eager to listen to the cossacks who are serving the proletariat."
dkb.17.a:0 "Cooperation instead of enmity."

dkb.18.t:0 "Gosplan"
dkb.18.d:0 "The new economy of the Don Republic should be planned. To this end, we will pursue the 'Gosplan', established by chairman Syrtsov as an efficient state body that will carry out national planning for the development of the national economy and control over the implementation of national economic plans."
dkb.18.a:0 "Much better than the market."

dkb.19.t:0 "Private Property?"
dkb.19.d:0 "While the ownership of private property is generally banned in our republic, some officials believe that we should allow cooperatives to exist. Not only will they ensure better cooperation between proletariat and peasantry and give them a reason to work; they will also allow the state to implement a special tax for profit."
dkb.19.a:0 "Ban any private ownership."
dkb.19.b:0 "Allow cooperation."

dkb.20.t:0 "Council of People's Deputies"
dkb.20.d:0 "With our republic stabilizing more and more, it is time to end the transitional period of the supreme power of the party's head. The legislation initiative shall now belong to the Council of People's Deputies - an elected parliament of our socialist republic."

dkb.21.t:0 "Council of People's Cossacks"
dkb.21.d:0 "With our republic stabilizing more and more, it is time to end the transitional period of the supreme power of the party's head. The legislation initiative shall now belong to the Council of People's Cossacks - and elected parliament of our socialist republic, consisting of 'People's Cossacks' - the most prominent party members."
dkb.21.a:0 "Socialism with Cossack characteristics."

dkb.22.t:0 "The Role of the Chairman"
dkb.22.d:0 "At this moment Semyon Budyonny has almost unlimited power, being a kind of a dictator in the country. From this perspective, he's no better than good old Ataman Krasnov, who ruled our country for 15 years, being a German puppet and a kleptocrat. Some people in the party believe that his role should be limited and he must step down - not only by the parliamentary Council, but also by the party and the government. Budyonny is a good man and a good leader - he won't confront the party in this question, but his authority is high enough to stifle initiative and consolidate power in his hands. What will happen?"
dkb.22.a:0 "Budyonny increases his role."
dkb.22.b:0 "Budyonny steps down and let Syrstov become a new Chairman."

dkb.23.t:0 "Remnants of Russian Socialists"
dkb.23.d:0 "After the Civil War, the majority of the Bolsheviks left for the French Commune. Those who stayed were either repressed or murdered.

dkb.25.t:0 "The 'NÈVE' Nationalization"
dkb.25.d:0 "The Taganrog iron and steel plant was originally founded by a Belgian industrialist named Albert Nève. During the Civil War, we nationalized the factory, but Nève managed to privatize it again three years later. It is now time to restore the Taganrog plant to the hands of the proletariat- all steel belongs to the workers and our republic!"
dkb.25.a:0 "Get rid of this pathetic excuse of a Belgian entrepreneur."

dkb.26.t:0 "French Commune Refused!"
dkb.26.d:0 "The French Commune has just proven that it is nothing more than a capitalist nation that hides under syndicalist banners! This is outrageous!"
dkb.26.a:0 "Disgrace!"


dkb.40.t:0 "Initial stabilisation"
dkb.40.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less-affected branches of the economy have bounced off the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."
dkb.40.a:0 "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon."

dkb.50.t:0 "Further stabilisation"
dkb.50.d:0 "The economy continues to regain pre-crisis efficiency."
dkb.50.a:0 "Keep it up!"

dkb.60.t:0 "An Illegal trade union was found"
dkb.60.d:0 "We have found another secret trade union in one of our factories. Workers have united to demand higher wages and better workplaces in this factory, and we now know the cause of this activity! We must blame the spread of syndicalist propaganda for this!"
dkb.60.a:0 "Allow it to operate but watch them closely."
dkb.60.b:0 "Disband the union and arrest the workers!"

dkb.61.t:0 "Unrest in Rostov"
dkb.61.d:0 "While the Cossack Circle was busy in their feud, the workers organized a large strike in Rostov and Taganrog. In the times of the already destabilizing Berlin Stock Crisis, this is a disaster. If we give up and accept their demands though, it is likely we won't risk revolution."
dkb.61.a:0 "Give in their demands"
dkb.61.b:0 "Never believe a syndicalist."

dkb.62.t:0 "Clashes in Rostov"
dkb.62.d:0 "There are reports of armed clashes in Rostov, with socialist protesters demanding the resignation of the Ataman and an immediate transition to a socialist republic. We can try to stifle the revolution, but our success is not guaranteed."
dkb.62.a:0 "Do something!"

dkb.63.t:0 "The unrest crushed!"
dkb.63.d:0 "The socialist protesters were crushed and their leader, Syrtsov, was arrested. Nothing will stop us now from improving the economy and politics."
dkb.63.a:0 "Great!"

dkb.64.t:0 "Revolution!"
dkb.64.d:0 "The rebellion has quickly spread, with Rostov lost to the socialists first, and then Taganrog and Nakhichevan. The Cossacks have refused to shoot these workers, and some of the Cossacks have even joined the rebels! The Cossack Cirle was disbanded, with Krasnov fleeing to Germany and Bogaevsky fleeing to Kuban. Now all the power is in the hands of Budyonny, who triumphantly united the Red Cossacks and Workers under the Banner of Socialism."
dkb.64.a:0 "Long live the socialist republic!"

dkb.65.t:0 "Second Soviet Russian Republic"
dkb.65.d:0 "Today, the new socialist government in the Don Republic, south of Russia, has proclaimed itself the successor of the nearly forgotten Soviet Russia, a nation destroyed in the chaos of the Russian Civil War.\n\nThe Chairman of the Don Socialist Republic, Semyon Budyonny, has stated that the revolutionary struggle of the Russian proletariat has not ended, but if we don't let up, the power of the Soviets will be eventually restored in Russia.\n\nIt is still a hot topic for discussion: how will the Russian government react to such statements, and will it tolerate the aggressive neighbour in its southern frontier?"
dkb.65.a:0 "The Russian Eagle will be destroyed by the Hammer and Sickle!"
dkb.65.b:0 "Will Russia ever rest?"

dkb.66.t:0 "Revolution in the Don Republic!"
dkb.66.d:0 "The socialists came to power in the Don Republic in the aftermath of the Black Monday catastrophe. While this is bad enough, the new leader of the nation has gone so far as to openly criticize our government, and has proclaimed himself the successor of Lenin. How shall we react?"
dkb.66.a:0 "Remind him how Lenin finished."
dkb.66.b:0 "Destroy them later."

dkb.67.t:0 "Opposition to the Regime"
dkb.67.d:0 "Before the fall of the old regime, the Russian state was a battlefield for many political factions, from the far-left to the far-right. Russian society was very polarized, and it is even more polarized now that our government rules all of Russia. Though we are Russians ourselves, from the people's view, we are invaders. We should begin stabilizing our regime with dealing with the most fierce opposition - especially amongst the conservative and rightist parties and organisations."
dkb.67.a:0 "Cleanse the opposition."

dkb.68.t:0 "Fate of Socialist Parties"
dkb.68.d:0 "The second part of our regime stabilization is to solve the question of what to do with socialists. While our ideas are almost the same, some of the socialist parties, like the social democratic Mensheviks and even the liberal Socialists-Revolutionaries are spreading their anti-government propaganda. We should deal with them now, or face the consequences of neglecting this threat later..."
dkb.68.a:0 "Arrest their leaders and ban their party."
dkb.68.b:0 "Execute their leaders."

dkb.69.t:0 "Trade Unions Issue"
dkb.69.d:0 "The Trade Unions are strong in Russia, and so, we should decide what to do with them. While some believe that trade unions are a truly socialist democratic phenomenon that we should use for our own interests, others believe that trade union policy should be dependent on the party politics."
dkb.69.a:0 "Independent Trade Unions"
dkb.69.b:0 "State controlled Trade Unions."

dkb.70.t:0 "Fate of the Russian Army"
dkb.70.d:0 "The Russian Army was much more organized and, frankly, massive than ours, and it is time for us to catch up. While many of the officers and soldiers have joined our side in this liberation war, some of them cannot be trusted. Some high military leaders have left the country, but the ones who stayed could be dangerous for the regime."
dkb.70.a:0 "Purge the army..."
dkb.70.b:0 "...and recruit new soldiers"

dkb.71.t:0 "The GlavVoyenSovet"
dkb.71.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetLeader] along with the supreme military stuff has proposed the establishement of the GlavVoyenSovet or the Main Military Council, that will be the head office of our new armed forces. The Council will be headed by the Chairman of Military and Navy Affairs, and will maintain and manage the Army."
dkb.71.a:0 "New to some, old to others..."



dkb.70.t:0 "Ukrainian language in the Don region"
dkb.70.d:0 "The Ukrainian officials, who once tried to include Don region with our capital Yekaterinodar into Ukraine, but were stopped by Krasnov and the local Cossack and White armies, haven't stopped their attempts to gain an influence in our country. This time, the Ukrainians are asking us to acknowledge Ukrainian as the second official language in Kuban. They have support from some members of the Kuban Cossacks in the 'Krug', who hope that this Ukrainian help will allow them to strengthen their position in the country. On the contrary, the Don Cossacks are sure to reject any agreement with the Ukrainians, since the Kingdom of Ukraine occupied a large part of the Don lands at the end of the Russian civil war."
dkb.70.a:0 "The Don Cossacks are right - we should claim our lands!"
dkb.70.b:0 "Make a compromise - the Ukrainians can fund some schools in the Don."
dkb.70.c:0 "The Ukrainian language is the second language in the Don region!"

dkb.80.t:0 "Land redistribution in Stavropol"
dkb.80.d:0 "The Stavropol region has a Russian majority, but the Kalmyks, who live in the Steppes near the Caspian Sea, claim that some of these lands in Stavropol should become a part of the Kalmykia. On the other hand, the Russians point out that the Kalmyks took lots of the peasant's lands in Stavropol during the civil war, and that the government must launch a land redistribution in the northern part of Stavropol region. What should we do?"
dkb.80.a:0 "The Russians are right - give these lands back to them."
dkb.80.b:0 "We won't start any land redistribution."
dkb.80.c:0 "The Kalmyks will get new lands!"

dkb.90.t:0 "Sharia courts in Chechnya"
dkb.90.d:0 "The Terek river divides the lands of the Terek Cossacks in the North and the Chechen lands in the South. The Chechens have asked us to allow them to use Sharia law and have Sharia courts. The Terek Cossacks think that this decision will lead to the radicalisation in this region, as well as new clashes between the local Cossacks and the Chechens. That's why the Cossacks suppose that they should have a right to arrest the radical Muslim priests who use the rules of Islam to solve different cases in the Chechen region. We have to give them our answer."
dkb.90.a:0 "The Cossacks will bring order to Chechnya!"
dkb.90.b:0 "We are a secular state, but only state authorities will arrest lawbreakers."
dkb.90.c:0 "The Chechens can use the Sharia law; it is a Muslim tradition..."

dkb.100.t:0 "Assassination attempt!"
dkb.100.d:0 "Today the Ataman's residence was attacked by a group of unknown terrorists who intended to kill our leader Pyots Krasnov! It seems that the main reason was the unpopular reforms he has implemented, which provoked significant instability in the Don-Kuban Union. From now on, the Ataman and his supporters have to pursue much more elaborate -and careful- policy efforts to restore order in the country and reduce the dissent of the nation."
dkb.100.a:0 "Keep calm and carry on!"

dkb.101.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Invites Us In Their Alliance"
dkb.101.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] decided to form an anti-Russian political and economic alliance. Their final goal is to unite all cossack hosts in the territories of former Russian Empire and proclaim a new Russian Government. How will we react to this?"

dkb.104.t:0 "Fate of PSR and RSDRP"

dkb.105.t:0 "Fate of Eurasianists and NRPR"
dkb.105.d:0 "The right-wing parties of Eurasianists (EP) and Savinkov's NRPR are a threat to our state. While Eurasianists want to get rid of our traditional Russian Culture, the methods of the NRPR are too radical for some. Moreover, the NRPR are criticizing our government, and see us as traitors. We should decide what to do with them."
dkb.105.a:0 "Ban the NRPR and the EP."
dkb.105.b:0 "Ban only the NRPR."
dkb.105.e:0 "Allow the EP to exist, but ban from elections."

dkb.106.t:0 "Reform the Senate"
dkb.106.d:0 "The reforms to the Senate, suggested by [ROOT.GetLeader], consist of creating a new proportion of representators in the body. Half of the senators should be cossacks, and the other half should be nobles, aristocrats, professors and industrialists."
dkb.106.a:0 "Approved."
dkb.106.b:0 "Let the other half be elected directly by the people!"

dkb.107.t:0 "The Role of President"
dkb.107.d:0 "In the old Russian Republic, the president was just a nominal figure, appointed by the Senate, who could do something only if the Duma and the Prime-Minister were on his side. This greatly destabilized the system, and many argue that it led to the assassination of Kerensky. In the new republic, as proposed by the Transitional Government, the president should have full authority over the parliament and the executive branch."

dongerman.1.t:0 "Cooperation With Germany"
dongerman.1.d:0 "Pyetr Krasnov, Ataman of the Don Host, has presented a bill, entitled the "Law on Cooperation with the German Empire to the Cossack Circle".

As was said by Krasnov, only Germany can protect our free Cossack state from Russian expansionism and aggression."
dongerman.1.a:0 "Send the proposition to the Kasierreich."

dongerman.2.t:0 "An Offer From the Don Republic"
dongerman.2.d:0 "The Don Republic has announced it's desire for cooperation with the Kasierreich. We definitely have an interest in the Caucasus, most notably being the oil fields. Our presence in the Caucasus could also possibly prevent Russia from intervening in Eastern Europe."

dongerman.4.t:0 "The Don-Kaukasien Deutsche Verwaltung"
dongerman.4.d:0 "With our clear direction and desire to further integrate with Germany, the German Administration, sent as part of the Treaty of Friendship with Germany, can now affect our economy. Depending on the influence of the German Administration, our economy will get buffs. But should the influence of the German Administration become too high, it will become harder and harder to keep our sovereignty."
dongerman.4.a:0 "We should watch them closely..."

dongerman.5.t:0 "KONR"
dongerman.5.d:0 "The German Administration has made us an offer that we simply can't refuse; to host the KONR - the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. The chairman of the Committee, Pyetr Krasnov himself, has proclaimed that the main aim of the Committee is to liberate the peoples of Russia, who are suffering from the inefficient and harmful reforms of Kerensky. The attempted assassination of President Kerensky and the political crisis have shown that Russia is unable to exist under a liberal or democratic government, and a firm hand is needed. Instead, Russia must be governed by a military cabinet or a council of professionals. Among them, there is Krasnov and the Dictator of Transamur, Kolchak. However, the future organisation of the Russian state is still not fully decided on. With his manifesto published, Krasnov expects long queues of refugees at the borders with Russia."
dongerman.5.a:0 "Russia simply can't be ruled by liberals."

dongerman.6.t:0 "ROA"
dongerman.6.d:0 "With the KONR firmly establishing itself in the Don, the next step towards a free Russia is the creation of a new army: the Russian Liberation Army. Ataman Krasnov has appointed Konstantin Mamontov as Commander-in-Chief of the army of Free Russia. The army will use German tactics and strategy to defend against Russian forces, should they once again draw their attention to our region."
dongerman.6.a:0 "An army to protect us."

dongerman.8.t:0 "Ostlegionen"
dongerman.8.d:0 "The German Administration has presented us with an initiative calling for a so-called "Ostlegionen" or Eastern Legion, consisting of ethnic minorities that live in the Don region. The Ostlegionen would be directly integrated into the ROA, and it will no doubt be a mighty force that will put the fear of God into our enemies."
dongerman.8.a:0 "An excellent idea! Conscript the minorities!"

novoros.1.t:0 "Bogaevsky's Republic"
novoros.1.d:0 "With Afrikan Bogaevsky quickly rising to become the Ataman of the Don Host, it is time to decide what to do next. While Afrikan himself is looking forward to cooperating with Russia, he has ambitions of his own.

novoros.5.t:0 "Customs Union With Ukraine"
novoros.5.d:0 "The region of Don is heavily populated by Ukrainians, consisting of about 30% of our population. During the rule of the previous government, despite its connections with Germany, the Ukrainians were oppressed, their language was prohibited, and they had no official residence permits. By granting these privileges to the Ukrainians, we can hopefully gain more sympathy from the Ukrainian minority."
novoros.5.a:0 "Let's see how they answer."

novoros.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Offers a Customs Union"
novoros.6.d:0 "The government of the recently established [FROM.GetNameDef] has offered us a customs union. Moreover, they are willing to give residence permits for all Ukrainians, who now live illegally in their territory. They are also willing to allow the Ukrainian language to be used in official settings. While the offer is good, we know that the [FROM.GetAdjective] government is pro-Russian and could be considered hostile."
novoros.6.a:0 "This will help make life better for our countrymen! Approved!"
novoros.6.b:0 "They are a hostile government! Rejected!"

novoros.7.t:0 "Ukraine Refuses"
novoros.7.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] govement has refused to establish a Customs Union. In retaliation, we shall not grant residence permits for Ukrainians. This will escalate the relations between our two nations, but they have made their choice."
novoros.7.a:0 "Odd, they don't seem too worried about their own citizens."

novoros.8.t:0 "Ukraine Accepts!"
novoros.8.d:0 "Ukraine has agreed to establish a Customs Union with us! We shall grant residence permits for all Ukrainians, as per our arrangement. Hopefully, this will help to establish good relations between our two nations."
novoros.8.a:0 "Here's to our new Ukrainian friends!"

novoros.9.t:0 "The Constitution of Novorossiya"
novoros.9.d:0 "Today, at long last, marks the completion of the Novorossiyan Constitution. Based heavily off of the Russian constitution of 1920, with influences from both the Kaiserreich and the United States's own constitutions. In effect, Novorossiya is to be a free, bicameral representative republic, with the head of state still maintaining enough power to effectively overrule the Duma and Council of the Republic respectively. The document also guarantees the right of assembly and free speech, as well as enshrining the Russian language as the official state language of Novorossiya. Overall, the document is a great increase for freedom and civil rights within Novorossiya."
novoros.9.a:0 "Glory to Bogaevsky!"

novoros.10.t:0 "Novorossiya Demands International Recognition!"
novoros.10.d:0 "The recently established state of Novorossiya has demanded international recognition. While this state is allied with Russia, we can support its independence."
novoros.10.a:0 "It is an artificial state."
novoros.10.b:0 "Recognize their government as legitimate, perhaps this could gain us a new ally?"

novoros.11.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Recognized Our Government!"
novoros.11.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has recognized our state and our independence."

novoros.12.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to recognize our state, and has decried us as an illegitimate government."
novoros.12.a:0 "We can count on no one but ourselves..."

novoros.13.t:0 "Expel German Delegations"
novoros.13.d:0 "The German presence in Novorossiya is, to put it mildly, against us due to us persuing closer ties with Russia. We simply must expel the German delegation as soon as possible. Their attempts to intervene in our internal affairs are reason enough to justifiably remove them from our glorious nation."
novoros.13.a:0 "Back to Germany you go, you rotten snakes."

novoros.14.t:0 "Council of the Republic"
novoros.14.d:0 "Bogaevsky has ordered the creation of the Council of the Republic as part of his political reforms for the new Novorossiyan Republic. The Council shall act as the upper house of the new Parliament. Modeled after the Russian Senate, the Council shall represent the upper class of the Novorossiyan population. The members of the Council are to be directly appointed by the Ataman of the Republic, and in turn, the Council shall elect the Ataman for life, as well as review any and all bills passed by the future Duma before their implementation into law." 
novoros.14.a:0 "The first step towards becoming a true republic."

novoros.15.t:0 "The State Duma of Novorossiya"
novoros.15.d:0 "The lower chamber of the parliament - the State Duma - has been established as a result of Bogaevsky's reforms. Consisting of representatives elected by any man over the age of 18, the new Duma shall form the basis of our new Republic. Following it's creation, a snap election was called and already the NSPN has achieved an absolute majority. However, the Kadets and Mensheviks have also gained a sizable mandate in recent elections."
novoros.15.a:0 "The foundation stone of the Republic has at last been laid."

dkbfor.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Incorporation!"
dkbfor.1.d:0 "The hostile government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has demanded our immediate incorporation into their state. While their army is large, we may still be able to defend ourselves."
dkbfor.1.a:0 "They are too strong."
dkbfor.1.b:0 "Never!"

dkbfor.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has Agreed!"
dkbfor.2.d:0 "The cowardly government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join our country without bloodshed."
dkbfor.2.a:0 "A wise choice."

dkbfor.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejected The Ultimatum!"
dkbfor.3.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] believes it is strong enough to defend themselves, and so has rejected our righteous demands. How shall we proceed?"
dkbfor.3.a:0 "Leave them alone, we have bigger fish to fry..."
dkbfor.3.b:0 "To arms!"
dkbfor.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Donbass And Crimea"
dkbfor.4.d:0 "Claiming that the majority of these territories are populated by the Russian, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has demanded we cede this territory to them. While transferring land in the East would only make us more vulnerable to Russia, many advisors urge us to avoid risking a war."
dkbfor.4.a:0 "These lands our rightful ours! We will stand our ground!"
dkbfor.4.b:0 "Peace is always preferable to war."

dkbfor.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns Donbass And Crimea"
dkbfor.5.d:0 "Following our demands, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to cede Donbass And Crimea to their rightful owners.."
dkbfor.5.a:0 "The pen is mightier then the sword."

dkbfor.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses To Cede Land!"
dkbfor.6.d:0 "Unfortunately, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused to cede us our rightful territory! How shall we deal with this going forward?"
dkbfor.6.a:0 "They called our bluff; we are not ready for war."
dkbfor.6.b:0 "They want to do this the hard war way? So be it." 

dkbfor.7.t:0 "Peace With [DKB.GetNameDef]?"
dkbfor.7.d:0 "The government of [DKB.GetNameDef] has occupied our eastern provinces. This war is beginning to threaten the existence of our very nation. Perhaps we should sue for peace?"
dkbfor.7.a:0 "Let's start peace talks."
dkbfor.7.b:0 "We shall crush this artificial Cossack state!"

dkbfor.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace!"
dkbfor.8.d:0 "The [FROM.GetNameDefCap] government, following our recent glorious victories, is ready to throw in the towel. They have agreed to cede the contested lands so peace can return between us. Of course, we don't have to agree. After all, the breadbasket of Europe in it's entirety is a very nice prize... "
dkbfor.8.a:0 "Deal, peace shall once more reign between us."
dkbfor.8.b:0 "No, all of Ukraine shall be ours!"

dkbfor.9.t:0 "Socialist Insurgency In Yekaterinodar"
dkbfor.9.d:0 "With the establishment of a socialist republic in Don, the powerful cooperative movement in our country has begun to radicalize. Unless we deal with it soon, our rule may not survive."
dkbfor.9.a:0 "Try to suppress the movement."
dkbfor.9.b:0 "Deal with the leadership!"

dkbfor.10.t:0 "Violent Protests in Yekaterinodar"
dkbfor.10.d:0 "Our attempts to deal with the socialists have been in vain. The protesters have somehow become armed and are demanding more freedom for trade unions. If we won't give up, they are likely to overthrow our government."
dkbfor.10.a:0 "Give them what they want"
dkbfor.10.b:0 "Do anything to suppress these rebels!"

dkbfor.11.t:0 "The Insurgency Suppressed!"
dkbfor.11.d:0 "The socialists have given up, and our country appears to be stabilizing from the shock of the near overthrow of our government. We need to be prepared for anything else the vile Socialists in the Don have planned..."
dkbfor.11.a:0 "The Red Menace is once more defeated!"

dkbfor.12.t:0 "The Socialists Overthrow the Government"
dkbfor.12.d:0 "The protesters have managed to overthrow our government. The vile Cossacks have been over thrown, and our county is under the Red banenr of freedom atlast!. As a first offical act, the new Worker's government has requested annexation into the last bastion of Socialism in Russia, the Don."
dkbfor.12.a:0 "Only together with the Don can we avenge Lenin!"

dkbfor.13.t:0 "Kuban Falls to Socialism"
dkbfor.13.d:0 "The protesters and workers have managed to overthrow the corrupt Kuban government, and are willing to unite with us into a single socialist republic."
dkbfor.13.a:0 "A great success!"

dkbfor.14.t:0 "Socialist Protest crushed in Kuban"
dkbfor.14.d:0 "The Revolution has been crushed in Kuban despite our best effots. With this, the only chance to spread the Revolution to the oppressed workers of Kuban is with war."
dkbfor.14.a:0 "Declare war at once! Workers of Kuban, your liberation is at hand!"
dkbfor.14.b:0 "We can't risk war with them now!"

dkbfor.15.t:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] Meets Korkmasov"
dkbfor.15.d:0 "Two leaders have met recently to talk about the future of the Mountain Republic. The violent and corrupt government of the Mountain Republic, which has violently crushed socialist opposition in the country, will do anything to prevent the Caucasian peoples from the liberating light of Socialism, thus [ROOT.GetLeader] and Korkmasov have agreeed to..."
dkbfor.15.a:0 "...bring the Revolution, with war."
dkbfor.15.b:0 "...aid Socialist rebels, to bring the Revolution internally."

dkbfor.16.t:0 "Don Socialists Support Revolutionaries"
dkbfor.16.d:0 "The Reds of the Don has been aiding the Socialist rebels within our nation! This is unacceptable! If they succeed, our nation would cease to exist! What should we do?"
dkbfor.16.a:0 "Declare war on the rebels!"
dkbfor.16.b:0 "Our nation is too stable! We will never fall to socialism!"

dkbfor.17.t:0 "Armed Revolt in Makhachkala!"
dkbfor.17.d:0 "Revolutionnaries have literally started a war in Dagestan. Supported by some of the workers and peasants of Makhachkala, they are building barricades in the city centre, demanding a transition to a Socialist governemnt!"
dkbfor.17.a:0 "Crush them!"

dkbfor.18.t:0 "Socialists Crushed in Makhachkala"
dkbfor.18.d:0 "We managed to destroy the socialists in Dagestan. However, we still should expect a reaction from the Reds in the Don. Perhaps they will try to cross the borders and overthrow us where the rebels failled."

dkbfor.19.t:0 "Korkmasov Rises to Power!"
dkbfor.19.d:0 "The socialists have seized administrative buildings in Dagestan, soon followed by Ingushetia, Karachay-Circassia and North Ossetia. In order to avoid a bloody civil war, we are allowing Korkmasov to form a new government."
dkbfor.19.a:0 "The Revolution triumphant!"
dkbfor.20.t:0 "Rebel Victory in the Mountain Republic!"
dkbfor.20.d:0 "Our covert support for the rebels has worked! Korkmasov has overthrown the corrupt capitalist regime and has begun to install socialism within the former Mountain Republic. With his victory comes the question, what next? Some are calling for us to directly annex the Republic, while others say we should let them exist, but under supervision from the heirs of Red October. What shall we do?"

dkbfor.20.b:0 "Annex the Mountain Republic."

dkbfor.21.t:0 "Rebels Crushed in the Mountain Republic!"
dkbfor.21.d:0 "The rebels we having been aiding the Mountain Republic have been crushed! Following new purges and arrests, Korkmasov has had to flee the country.

dkbfor.22.t:0 "Smolensk Conference"
dkbfor.22.d:0 "We have decided to hold a Conference in Smolensk between us and the Kaiserreich, to decide the future of our two nations. Our country is big and strong, and the German Empire is weak and it cannot risk the war on two fronts. We must claim our sphere of influence and hope that Germany will agree. Of course, we should expect that the Germans will want something from us in return. But it will be better for them to avoid war."
dkbfor.22.a:0 "We demand our rightful borders!"

dkbfor.23.t:0 "The Conference Continues"
dkbfor.23.d:0 "Russia has demanded control over our allies in the East. While this will help us to avoid war, we should ask for something in return."

dkbfor.24.t:0 "German Demands"
dkbfor.24.d:0 "Germany has agreed to our terms, but it has suggested that we join the Reichspakt - and, therefore, the war against Communards."

dkbfor.24.b:0 "An alliance with Germany? Never."

dkbfor.25.t:0 "Russia Refused!"
dkbfor.25.d:0 "Russia has refused the offer to join the Reichspakt. What shall we do now?"

dkbfor.26.t:0 "The German Response..."
dkbfor.26.d:0 "Our diplomats received a response from the German government this morning... and it's not entirely what we wanted to hear. While they agreed to most of our demands, they also made it clear that the Baltic shall remain as their sole zone of influence. Some in our government find those terms unacceptable, while others don't want to provoke the Germans further. What should we do now?"
dkbfor.26.a:0 "No point in risking a strong response. We agree."

dkbfor.28.b:0 "We will not agree with those dogs!"

dkbfor.29.t:0 "Russia Refused!"

dkbfor.29.a:0 "Agree of the previous terms"
Dkbfor.29.b:0 "We will not agree with such dogs!"

dkbfor.30.t.:0 "Germany Accepts, but asks for Compromise.”
dkbfor.30.d:0 "Germany has agreed to our terms, but it has suggested that the Baltics and Belarus should stay in their sphere of influence. The Germans so far have been fair and reasonable. Though these lands have long been ours, and the Baltics have the only warm water ports will we possibly get in this region. We could just just ask for Belarus then be done with it."
dkbfor.30.a:0 "Estonia, Latvia and Belarus should be ours."
dkbfor.30.b:0 "Belarus is Russia.

dkbfor.31.t:0 "Russia asks For Estonia, Latvia and Belarus"
dkbfor.31.d:0 "Russia has asked for Estonia, Latvia and Belarus. While these could appease the Russian Bear it will only do that. Appease it can be only a matter of time before they come and ask for more and more and more. Eventually they’ll be right in Berlin and ready to strike. Of course that in theory and it is all just paranoia. The decision is up to you, Kaiser. "
dkbfor.31.a:0 "Deal!"
dkbfor.31.b:0 "We can only agree on Belarus."
dkbfor.31.c:0 "No, they are our natural allies."

dkbfor.32.t:0 "Germany has refused.”
dkbfor.32.d:0 "Germany has refused to give us Estonia, Latvia and Belarus. This clear act of holding back of Russian Greatness should also be seen as an act of fear of it. They thought we were weak, why would they not give it to us? Ultimately it is up to you to decide what our next course of action is."
dkbfor.32.a:0 "Agree on their previous terms."
dkbfor.32.b:0 "Ask only for Belarus."
dkbfor.32.c:0 "We shall not agree with those wolves!"

dkbfor.33.t:0 "Germany has agreed to give us only Belarus."
dkbfor.33.d:0 "German Demands are firm on this, they shall not concede on only but Belarus. This topic seems to be at a closing and we won’t be getting anything else. We could take what we can get or leave the tables and decide on the Field of Mars who deserves these lands!"
dkbfor.33.a:0 "Deal!"
dkbfor.33.c:0 "We should probably walk away from these Mudaks."

dkbfor.34.t:0 "Russia Asked For Belarus"

dkbfor.36.t:0 "The Talks Between Us and Germany Continues"
dkbfor.36.d:0 "Germany has agreed to our terms, but it has suggested that the Baltics and Ukraine should stay in their sphere of influence. Ukraine among our wants in Eastern Europe is the most important. They are the breadbasket of Europe for a reason and having them there could aid us in feeding the people. We could simply just leave it there and take the Warm Water ports and take things and stuff them in the Kaiser’s face."
dkbfor.36.a:0 "Let them have the Baltics, but we will take Ukraine."
dkbfor.36.b:0 "Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine should be in a package."
dkbfor.36.c:0 "We need Estonia and Latvia in a package."

dkbfor.37.t:0 "Russia Askes For Ukraine"
dkbfor.37.d:0 "Russia has asked for Ukraine. This is our major bread basket and one of our only places we can acquire steady food, without it and if we fail to manage the food we must suffer turnip winters like we did in the First Weltkrieg and that is most unacceptable, Kaiser. People starved to death then and they can starve to death now. Please Kaiser, I beg of you to not let the Russsians have that land back. We cannot simply trust them. However the choice is yours, my Kaiser."
dkbfor.37.a:0 "We can trust them, we have to!"
dkbfor.37.c:0 "We cannot suffer another Turnip Winter!"

dkbfor.38.t:0 "They have refused Ukraine!"
dkbfor.38.d:0 "The Germans wrapped with fear of us have refused! Of course we should have expected that the Germans are forever fearful of us! They can’t forget the past to forge such an alliance between us and them. Maybe we should reconsider these talks?"
dkbfor.38.a:0 "We must accept the previous agreement."
dkbfor.38.c:0 "Mudaks...Germans are always mudaks."

dkbfor.39.t:0 "Russia Asked For Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine."
dkbfor.39.a:0 "Let them have Ukraine, but we will leave Baltics for us."

dkbfor.40.d:0 "Germany has seen the light thanks to our diplomats! They showed enough trust to hand over such an important area to us and hopefully we can move hand-in-hand into the future together."

dkbfor.43.t:0 "Germany Leaves the Conference."
dkbfor.43.d:0 "As he saw the Germans, he knew what it meant. It was the end of the conference, and there was nothing gained from either side. Dimitri left with his colleague heading back to the hotel the Russian Delegation has been attending during the whole conference. It was a building not fit for a person, let alone an international delegation. This whole conference stunk of Germany doing this to save face. As he returned to his room Dimitri wrote up a report informing the Government of what had happened."
dkbfor.43.a:0 "Their loss."

dkbfor.44.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Wants To Join Our Faction"
dkbfor.44.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has seemingly decided to harken back to our previous cooperations by asking to join our alliance. Though they lie on the far side of Eastern Europe, they might prove to be a valuable ally. How shall we respond?"
dkbfor.44.a:0 "Sure!"
dkbfor.44.b:0 "We are better off without them..."

dkbfor.45.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refused To Join Our Faction"

We must not let the next war devolve into the slogging horror that was the Weltkrieg, so new solutions must be imagined. Without developing modern tactics, we will be consumed by those who surround who have!"

DKU_Produce_More_Equipment:0 "Produce More Equipment"
DKU_Produce_More_Equipment_desc:0 "With our growing armies and our new doctrines developed, the demand for fresh equipment has never been higher. We must expand quotas, build new factories, hire more workers, and anything else we can do to increase our industrial output. Every hand a rifle!"

DKU_Military_Industrial_Complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
DKU_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc:0 "Our private defense industry shall pursue far closer ties with the military and military’s administration in order to smooth cooperation between the two. Like two pieces of the same puzzle, they shall feed off each other, rapidly fueling the rise of our military’s size and strength while also furthering their influence in our government."

DKU_Modernize_Artillery:0 "Modernize Artillery"
DKU_Modernize_Artillery_desc:0 "Modern artillery’s effectiveness has been proven since its inception in the 19th century, being used in every major conflict on Earth since. The next war shall likely be no different, so we must keep pace with the times and our neighbors by modernizing our arsenal at once. Larger and more accurate guns will be needed for the next war so that we may reign fire down upon our potential foes."

DKU_Standartized_Equipment_Production:0 "Standardized Equipment Production"
DKU_Standartized_Equipment_Production_desc:0 "Lighting fast production speeds will be needed if our industry is to keep pace with any future foe. To streamline production and increase outputs, sweeping standardization codes will be drafted, setting official manufacturing guidelines on every piece of equipment we make. All tools and manufacturing equipment will be modified, or if impossible replaced, in order to match the new standards. Though this might slow production down temporarily as factories are refitted, the future benefit to our production speeds will be well worth it."

DKU_Tanks_Of_Don:0 "The Armored Columns of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Tanks_Of_Don_desc:0 "Tanks, while only introduced towards the end of the Weltkrieg, shocked the world with their ingenuity and effectiveness, both as weapons of war and weapons of intimidation. Though the lumbering behemoths of the past will likely not prove effective in future wars, updating and modernizing the concept with the creation of fresh designs might yield success. Using foreign influences, chiefly from Russia and Germany, we shall develop a new line of tanks fitting for our state."

DKU_A_New_Army:0 "A New Army"
DKU_A_New_Army_desc:0 "Our current army is a relic of the past; lying disorganized and outmoded as archaic artefacts of the past. With our new doctrines developed and new equipment being produced, this will all soon change. Even now, the troops are being drilled on how to use their new tools of war and how to understand our new tactics and doctrine. Our new army shall be the pride of the state, serving as sword and shield for the people of our great nation."

DKU_A_Cossack_Airforce:0 "A Cossack Airforce"
DKU_A_Cossack_Airforce_desc:0 "The spirit of the Cossacks shall take wing and fly with the creation of an official, independent airforce for our nation. Previously, what few planes available to our military’s use that wasn't a cargo plane were tied to the army’s beck and call. Though they shall still cooperate, and their Cossack roots will continue to bind them, an independent air force will allow our flyboys a greater degree of freedom in their development."

DKU_Expand_Airfields:0 "Expand Airfields"
DKU_Expand_Airfields_desc:0 "With the advent of air warfare, planes have become increasingly emphasized and utilized by powers around the world as they realized the wide range of potential applications for aircraft. Our state is no different, and in order to better support our burgeoning air force, we shall expand airfields across the nation so that more planes can be stored at the ready and so more pilots can be trained."

DKU_Fighters_For_Don:0 "The Fighter Squadrons of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Fighters_For_Don_desc:0 "Fighter planes first proved their effectiveness in dogfights and anti-bomber missions in the Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War, capturing the attention of the world with their near-mythic and seemingly death-defying pursuits. With their uses proven on the battlefield, it is almost guaranteed that they will be needed in the next war as well. We shall construct as many as we can, so that we may act as beehive of sorts, releasing a swarm once threatened, blocking out the sun with our wings and drowning out the screams of our enemies with the roar of engines and propellers."

DKU_Bombers_For_Don:0 "The Bomber wings of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Bombers_For_Don_desc:0 "The sheer devastation even a single bomber can unleash was first witnessed in the fires of the Weltkrieg, and their effectiveness has only increased since with better planes and larger bombs. We will double down on their production and fill the skies with our bombers, ready to unleash hell on any who would dare march against us."

DKU_Secure_The_Sky:0 "Secure the Sky"
DKU_Secure_The_Sky_desc:0 "The security of our sovereign airspace must be maintained at all times. If we allow any enemy to achieve aerial superiority over our great state, the results would be catastrophic. This must never be allowed to occur. Anti-air emplacements will spread to dot the nation as a shield against stray foes while our air force shall be the sword, meeting their prey head on in the clouds. The skies of our home shall be ours and ours alone."

DKU_The_Black_Sea_Fleet:0 "The Black Sea Fleet"
DKU_The_Black_Sea_Fleet_desc:0 "The Black Sea serves as our gateway into the wider world and the chief artery of our economy. Without it, our nation would surely collapse. To protect our naval assets and our shores, the Black Sea Fleet must rise, renovated and reformed from the ashes of our current sorry excuse for a naval force. New ships shall be constructed and old ones refitted in our quest to achieve security and perhaps primacy in our home sea."

DKU_Port_Of_Capital:0 "Port Of [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
DKU_Port_Of_Capital_desc:0 "A new grand port shall be created on the coast of the Black Sea, serving as the center of our new naval expansion and reformation efforts. With a new access point into this major artery, our naval influence in our waters shall only increase, as does too our output of naval equipment and the ability to maintain it."

DKU_Ukranian_Exercises:0 "[ROOT.GetAdjective]-Ukranian Naval Exercises"
DKU_Ukranian_Exercises_desc:0 "Ukraine is one of our closest neighbors and has always served as a major partner in the region, especially when it comes to nautical matters. To further this cooperation, joint naval exercises will be held with the Ukranian Navy to help both of our naval staffs to gain real experience."

DKU_Defend_Coast:0 "Defend Convoys"
DKU_Defend_Coast_desC:0 "Though influential on its waters and important to us, the Black Sea is shared with many other peoples. From rival nations to pirates, these waters are never truly safe. We must ensure the security of our convoys through the application of new patrol routes while also arming the crews of our convoys in case of pirate boardings. Our mercantile fleet must be kept safe, as they are the lifeline of our nation."

DKU_Submarine_Effort:0 "Submarine Effort"
DKU_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "Submarines shocked the world with their effectiveness in the last great war and ever since, their concept has deeply intrigued our naval staff. With new naval infrastructure in place and new funding allocated to their budget, the Navy has moved to pursue development on our own submarine models. We too shall become wolves of the sea."

DKU_Invest_In_Shipbuilding:0 "Invest In Shipbuilding"
DKU_Invest_In_Shipbuilding_desc:0 "New ships are a necessity for the formation of any great navy, and our state is no exception. New naval infrastructure will be created in order to further speed up shipbuilding efforts, while more dock workers and engineers will be hired to speed up their work. We shall soon have a navy worthy of our proud state!"

DKU_Produce_Cruisers:0 "Produce Cruisers"
DKU_Produce_Cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers are just about the largest ships our state is capable of manufacturing in any reasonable amount of time while still being able to maintain them post-launch. They serve as fantastic light to medium warships that can fill a variety of roles and, while not as large as the battleships of the Great Powers, they can still outgun or outrun most other vessels they’d come across. With this in mind, our state has gone ahead and okayed a new push on cruiser development and production. They shall serve as the flagships of our new fleet; our powerful Pearls of the Black Sea."

DKB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The only reason that prevented Don Republic from being absorbed by Russia is the Minsk Treaty and German Empire, in particular. But with the first signs of German economy crumbling, it is a matter of time if the Cossack Republic will continue to exist. With the leadership divided and socialists ready to restore socialist power in Don, the Cossack Republic enters the 1936."
KUB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Proclaimed in 1918, Kuban People's Republic was on the right side of the hedge in the chaos of the Russian Civil War. A stable economic growth, democracy and cooperation made it possible for Kuban to become one of the most successful splinter states of the Russian Empire. Unceasing conflicts between two parliamentary groups, pro-Ukranian and pro-Russian ensured good relations both with Russia and Reichspact. However, who knows if it is not just a calm before the storm."
MTR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Mountain Republic is a good example of how more than 18 nationalities live together in one country. Since 1918 Tapa Chermoyev, a Chechen oil industrialist and millioner has been in control, which quickly turned the state into an oligarchic republic. The discontent with the government is growing and the society is radicalizing, with socialists and islamists getting more and more powerful. Will Chermoyev secure his shaky rule?"
