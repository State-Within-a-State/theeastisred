natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nWidely known as National Syndicalism, often also as Social Nationalism, Charter Totalism, no-adjective Totalism or even Charterism is the world's newest, but also the fastest growing, leading ideology on the authoritarian end of the leftist spectrum. Tracing its roots as far back as to the writings of the highly influential Revolutionary Syndicalist Georges Sorel, and then later developed by many Interventionist Socialist movements such as the Italian 'Leagues of Revolutionary Action', National Syndicalism aims to reform society to the extent which has never been attempted or done before by any regime, government nor even religion. This, according to its proponents, can only be achieved by the mobilization of a truly mass movement of workers, one that shall be a true vanguard of the revolution and reject the delusions of the vanguardist party which has brought the failed revolutionary Lenin to the dustbin of history. Such a force shall overthrow the corrupt and decadent order, of democracy, bourgeoisie and aristocracy, and usher in the total transformation of many a 'plutocratic' nations into true Proletarian Nations, emboldened in their productive, morally vigorous character thus aimed towards grander purposes through maximum cohesion, concentration of forces, iron discipline and utter ruthlessness. Economically, the ideals of National Syndicalism will unite economic classes into a program of national development and growth, enabled by the socialization of the economy and either united national character of various trade unions or one over-union serving the state. The Class War cannot unify the nation, and thus shall be replaced by Class Rejuvenation combining the forces of the lower and increasingly drawn towards Totalism middle class, together with unifying Imperialism yet combined with the Brotherhood of Nations, adhering to and respecting the Charter. Ultimately, the ideology which has been codified in the 'Totalist Charter' mainly drafted by Benito Mussolini, Italy's 'Dux Bellorum' who has galvanized the Socialists towards the First War; former British Conservative, visionary noble and founder of the Maximist group Oswald Mosley; and the intellectual of the Sorelians within the CGT Georges Valois, is often modified and unique to the specific character of the nation in which it is implemented, molded by the absolute and charismatic Totalitarian Socialist guidance of the Chairman."
authcom_subtype:0 "Communism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Communism)§!\n\nThe term 'Communism' is usually used to designate one of the main alternatives to orthodox French and English Syndicalism in the modern Socialist world. Based on the writings and thoughts of Marx, Engels and Lenin, the varied ideology - commonly also called Marxism, Lenininsm, or Marxism-Lenininsm to honor its main ideaologues and to distinguish it from other new alternative pathways to the shared Communist idyll like Broad Communism, National Communism, or Anarcho-Communism -  promotes revolution as a means of seizing power led by a vanguard party operating on the principles of democratic centralism composed of professional revolutionaries, representing both workers and peasants, who would establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, a phase of Socialism serving as a transition from the Capitalist bourgeois society to the ideal classless and stateless society: the Communist society. During this phase of Socialism the means of production would be transferred from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. The tendencies within the Leninist current may differ, but all Communists are united in their struggle for a better world for the proletariat of the whole world."
sorelianism_subtype:0 "Sorelianism"
sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nModern Sorelianism, while obviously having its core in the ideas proposed by the highly influential French political philosopher Georges Sorel, has been carried forwards into the Communard reality by the intellectual duo of Georges Valois and Édouard Berth. Sorelianism at first was born out of the revision and rejection of orthodox Marxism, for 'Socialism has died' due to the 'Decomposition of Marx'. Thus Sorel expanded on the theories of the French Anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, another monumental influence on Valois and Berth who founded the 'Cercle Proudhon', advocating that through direct action against the bourgoise enemy and the 'myth' of the general strike as expressed in Revolutionary Syndicalism shall the working class attain better living conditions. Yet the 'productive energy' of the bourgoise class, put into slumber due to the degenerating influence of the greatest evil which ever manifested in France, that being liberal democracy, will once again wake after the class war rejuvenates both the autonomous proletariat and the newly productive bourgoise. The disdain towards parliamentary democracy and secularist spirit can even be seen in Sorelians' support for Classicism in art. While the rejection of democracy led some Sorelians to support for a revolutionary monarchy, especially those that originated from AF like Valois himself, such views were mostly dropped after the establishment of the Commune. Another important concept in Sorelianism is the exoltation of the warrior-individual, manifestation of true freedom when combined with devotion to the family, the weak and labour ethic. In a fully realized Sorelian society as expanded on by Valois such a group would serve as the ruling class, somewhere above the ordinary proletariat. The modern Sorelian duo continue to follow the core tenants of Sorel while introducing many elements unique to their thinking, such as Maurrasian Integral Nationalist influences carried from their days in Action Française, rabid Anti-Semitism, Berthian synthesis between Marxian materialism and Bergsonian metaphysics, creation of the Estates General of French Production and introduction of stable gold-backed currency as outlined by Valois' long-time collaborator Jacques Arthuys, slightly increased centralization compared to Sorel's original vision and the mixing of revolutionary syndicalism and corporatism. Sorelianism, despite being a distinct movement, laid the foundations for the eventual development of National Syndicalism into the wider Totalist Charter."
national_communism_subtype:0 "National Communism"
national_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Communism)§!\n\nWhile sometimes confused with movements that are rabidly nationalist, intentionally so by enemies of the tendency, the simplest definition of National Communism would be the desire to implement Marxist Communism or other forms of Socialism in accordance and respect to the local realities. The proponents of such method reject the entirely stateless internationalist vision and once again turn towards the oft ignored 'National Question, pondering with renewed energy how to combine their ideology with the preservation or restoration of particular aspects their native culture. The origins of National Communism can be found among the various minority activists within the Bolshevik movement, such as Ukraine's Vasyl Shakhrai, Tatarstan's Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev and Crimea's Ismail Firdevs, who became disillusioned with the continuation of cultural chauvinism so ever-present during the oppressive imperial era. Another important voice in the melding of national interests with communism, unrelated to the groups which operated within the Russian Communist Party, is the Borotbist movement led by Alexander Shumsky. National Communists carry the torch of Marx while noting that his position of workers having 'no country' refers to the globalized bourgeoisie states, machines for exploitation against which the policy of full independence or wide national autonomy in cooperation with new Socialist cores ought to be employed. For true Socialism, touching upon every aspect of local tradition, cannot be achieved unless the 'colonized' groups break the chains of their metropolitan masters. While to many Communists every National Communist represents a certain 'national deviation', the tendency itself does not merge its goals with explicit nationalism represented by the usual meaning of such term. That is not to say certain groups do not increase their reliance on the 'national' part of their ideology. The National Communist term has also been applied to Marxist thinkers which do advocate an alliance with rabidly nationalistic and chauvinistic groups inside their nations, much to the chagrin of conventional representative of the ideology who call such positions 'Social-Reactionism', the most famous of them being the German Communist Heinrich Laufenberg, who developed the idea described by him as 'National Bolshevism'.   "
technocratic_socialism_subtype:0 "Technocratic Socialism"
technocratic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Technocratic Socialism)§!\n\nWhile the basic understanding of Technocratic Socialism, often confused with the Technocratic movement despite being two distinct entities with differing origins, could lead some to think it's a mere combination of technological advancement with socialist policies such a view would be particularly limited. For the technocratic tendency within Socialism is often born out of the very material understanding of the world through the use of the political ideology, although some say pure science of Marx, developed by the Father of Communism and further expanded upon by a diverse group of thinkers. The most important of the groups fitting such a descriptor is the Bolshevik 'Proletkult', the 'Proletarian Culture' movement having its origins in the ideological Vpered, or 'Forward', faction of their party. Led by the coalition of Anatoly Lunacharsky, a close friend of V.I. Lenin and the People's Commissar of Education during the Revolution, Alexander Bogdanov, one of Lenin's greatest rivals for a time and the man around whom the original Vpered coalesced, and Valerian Polyansky, editor-in-chief of proletarian literature and progenitor of Soviet censorship. The main principle of the Proletkult is their devotion to progress and ardent 'religious' belief in the collective society and Scientific Socialism, a construct which gave birth to the Proletarian Religion and the 'God-Building' principle. Based on the Auguste Comte's 'Religion of Humanity' the Proletkultists deify the Socialist Enlightenment given form as a new faith, one capable of replacing the corrupt old lore of the dying bourgeoisie world, a plane in which even immorality may be achieved according to A. Bogdanov and his experiments with blood transfusion. Another important thinker of the Proletkult, although distinct from the Lunacharsky group, is Aleksei Gastev. Proponent of a Syndicalist-Technocratic Soviet system breaking with the orthodox Leninist tradition, Gastev is the creator of the 'Ustanovka' concept, aiming to install a revolutionary mental attitude within Russia through the use of social engineering and scientific management drawing upon the works of Frederick Taylor. With the great mission of labour overseen by a technically minded avant-garde the proletariat shall move time itself forward."
georgian_socialism_subtype:0 "Georgian Socialism"
georgian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Georgian Socialism)§!\n\nGeorgian Socialism could be understood as an adaptation of Leninist Bolshevism to the context of a reborn Georgia, according to National Communistic principles. Such a break with Leninist orthodoxy is the brainchild of Ioseb 'Koba' Jughashvili, a former fighter in the Russian Revolution who escaped to his native Georgia in the aftermath of the White victory in the Civil War. While Georgian Socialism upholds elements shared by many Communist parties claiming the legacy of the Revolution, such as a focus on class warfare, party's doctrinal purity, wealth redistribution, rapid industrialization, and rural collectivization, the differentiating parts make it distinct from other exiles such as mainstream Zinovievites. For Koba's socialism is an ideology rabidly anti-Russian, vowing to never again let his homeland be at the whim of the Muscovite chauvinists. To that extent a massive campaign for the rebirth of Georgian culture must be undertaken, so that the natives of Koba's domain can have the strength to oppose the foreign oppressors. Another key point in Georgian Socialism is the total control of the state and the ultimate devotion of the people towards it, as represented and hinged upon the figure of Chairman Jugashvili, viewed as the incarnate form of his Sakartvelo. Lastly, Georgian Socialists posit a program of unification of the native ethnoses of Caucasus, bound together by their inner strength developed through the centuries spent combating the Russo-Turkish imperialists. While some foreign observers point out similarities between Ioseb Jughashvili's movement and the emerging 'Totalist Charter' such comparisons are quickly shot down by the devout adherents of the Georgian ideology, still claiming that theirs is a genuine adaptation of true Marxist principles. "
mladorossi_subtype:0 "Social Monarchism"
mladorossi_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Social Monarchism)§!\n\nWhile Monarchism and Socialism are typically contradictory ideologies, several movements have embraced a seemingly impossible mix of Monarchism and Socialism. Movements such as the Mladorossi - who call for a form of ‘Labor Monarchy’ - are followed by many other varied Socialist regimes who have decided to keep their Monarchs around as figureheads, though some rare examples of a monarch truly invested in the Socialist system do exist. The Mladorossi themselves seek to combine ideas of Russian Monarchism with the Soviet Socialist system, fusing Marxist principles with Russian Nationalism and Traditionalism under the embrace of a Red Crown and Aristocracy and united by Orthodox faith."
autocratic_socialist_subtype:0 "Autocratic Socialism"
autocratic_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Autocratic Socialism)§!\n\nAutocratic Socialist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are notably varied, but can usually be seen with some form of command economy, emphasis on militarism, are often nationalist or use patriotism as a tool of the state, and are frequently at odds with more mainline Charter Totalists. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."
red_junta_subtype:0 "Red Junta"
red_junta_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Junta)§!\n\nMilitary juntas with explicitly leftist slants are as diverse as their non-red counterparts, but what unites them is a professed need for the military to 'defend' socialism within the nation they've taken root in. While the authority of generals and soldiers now starts to supplant the authority of commissars and secretaries, the Red Junta will do its utmost to remove perceived corrupt civilian bureaucrats and subversive elements that would misuse the revolutionary government's wheels of power for their own ends. This removal typically involves a deeply autocratic police state and waves of martial build-up so that the junta's power may eventually morph into something less militant once the deeds are done, or, in less generous regimes, for the junta to permanently solidify its grip on the nation. Despite this new wave of militant authoritarianism, however, socialist governance commonly remains in Red Juntas alongside the crackdowns, with the lower classes still afforded the welfare and various protections they were promised before the junta's assent into power."
caponism_subtype:0 "Mafioso Socialism"
caponism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mafia Socialism)§!\n\nMafioso Socialism, often just called Caponism or Caponeism after its leading ‘theorist’, is the ideology ascribed to notable crime lord and pseudosocialist Alphonse Capone, who rose to political prominence within the American Socialist movement during the Civil War. Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."
juche_subtype:0 "Juche"
juche_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Juche)§!\n\nA totalitarian ideology unique to the Far East, Juche describes a syncretic variant of National Syndicalism incorporating and emphasizing ideas, practices, and motifs of Marxism, Nationalism, Militarism, Autarkism, and even Monarchism. Claiming that only through total self-sufficiency and with total devotion to the one Supreme Leader can the nation truly achieve real Socialism, and eventually, utopia. Harsh towards any form of Liberalism, Counter-Revolutionary action, or any other ideas deemed an obstacle to the state, only through total loyalty to the Party and to the Supreme Leader can one reap the benefits of the state, and all those who fail in these duties are branded enemies of the state without remorse."
nazbol_subtype:0 "Molotovism"
nazbol_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Molotovism)§!\n\nVyacheslav Molotov's brand of communism has been called many different things, be it National Bolshevism, Russian National Bolshevism, Molotovism, Marxism-Leninism-Molotovism or even National Bolshevik strain of the Russian Communist Party, in a way mirroring the highly heterodox manner in which the main tenets of his thought are outlined. According to Molotov, V.I. Lenin was the first National Bolshevik, for his glorious Revolutionary cause was directed against foreign exploiters; the imperialist nobles who treated the worker and peasant classes as lower beings while flaunting their knowledge of French, German, English and other foreign customs. In Molotov’s eyes, the true Communist cause was one of the National Liberation of Russia - its genuine populace wholly included no matter what the supposed 'nationality' of theirs was - while upholding the truth that Lenin fought for his Socialist Fatherland. Molotovites believe that the nefarious White Guardist forces, who once plunged Russia into two decades of corruption under the failed Republic, represented the anti-human trinity of liberalism, bourgeois democracy and capitalism. Only through the blows of the hammer and strikes of the sword, through enthusiastic campaigns emulating the highly productive shock workers, and through industrialization & urbanization shall this unholy trinity be shattered, and Russia finally guided out of the dark ages the aristocratic strata kept it in, for if Molotov is allowed to act, he shall do so, establishing a glorious state of Socialism in One Nation based on values of social and national justice for all the oppressed within."
obammunism_subtype:0 "Obamaism"
obammunism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Obamaism)§!\n\nObamaism, sometimes called Obama Thought, Spiritual Pan-Africanism, Maumauism, or even ‘Obamunism’, describes the specific form of Pan-Africanism pioneered by Onyango Obama of the Mau-Mau. Combining the esoteric spiritual beliefs of the Mau-Mau group that raises Obama as the physical manifestation of their patron deity the ‘Ghost Goat’ with occultist practices, witchcraft, shamanism, Socialist Pan-Africanism, and Pan-African Nationalism, this syncretic ideology is unique in its outlook on the traditional Pan-African cause. Calling for cooperation and unity between all peoples of African under a totalitarian but benevolent Socialist hereditary theocracy under the prophet Obama that is backed by a strong volunteer and fanatically devoted military and supported by an economy vaguely resembling autarkic Agrarian National Syndicalism mixed with traditional tribalist practices, Obamaism is a ideology that could only be forged in the melting pot of chaos and extremism that is colonial Africa."
germanic_socialism_subtype:0 "Germanic Socialism"
germanic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Germanic Socialism)§!\n\nThe term 'Germanic Socialism' refers to the ideology unique to Germany theorized by Paul Lensch and his political party the GSVP. Drawing on the writings of Oswald Spengler, Volkist theses and the policies of the Iron Chancellor Bismarck and of the Soldier-King Frederick William I while rejecting classical Marxist and socialist theories, this ideology places Germany as a unique nation in the world, a symbol of the Proletariat fighting against bourgeois nations such as France and Britain. Germanic Socialism therefore promotes the unity of the German people within a single Pan-Germanic state, united by the central figure of the 'Volkskanzler', guardian of the Germanic Tradition and of the People's Empire. The economy of the German Socialist state is organized in a corporatist manner, with national industries and private enterprises working hand in hand. The atypical positions of Germanic Socialism have led to its condemnation as reactionary and pseudo-socialist by the vast majority of the world's socialist movements, although it has found some adherents among both the upper and lower classes in Germany."
left_eurasianism_subtype:0 "Left Eurasianism"
left_eurasianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Eurasianism)§!\n\nLeft Eurasianism was born out of the rejection of the movement's Orthodox form, so far upheld by the intellectual elite allied with the aristocratic classes. Ironically such a rejection came from a prince, for the leader of the Party of Left Eurasianists is none other than the 'Red Prince' Dmitri Petrovich Svyatopolk-Mirskiy. Despite being one of the founders of the Eurasianist Party D. S. Mirskiy, as he is more commonly known, became highly interested in the emerging art movements of the Communard and British revolutions, certainly due to his background as an influential literary historian. With the continued triumphs of international socialism and progressing destitution ensured by the Kerensky regime the Red Prince turned to Marxism, maintaining his Eurasianist views while rejecting the Trubetskoy majority as the guards of the ruling elite. And thus, Mirskiy had to make broad coalition across the left side of the political spectrum, reaching out to Roman Jakobson of the Socialist Eurasianist Labour Party and elements within the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries that are sympathetic towards Eurasianism. The result of such alliances was the foundation of Left Eurasianism as a political doctrine, incorporating elements of Panslavic internationalism, anti-clericalism combined with a respect for religion itself, Soviet based system including autonomous ethnic councils, Intellectual Avant-gardism. A diverse menagerie held together by the figure of the chairman, a certain 'Ceasar of October' serving as an heir to Lenin, who shall guide the renewed Eurasian nation towards a global revolution, crushing the bourgeoisie and liberating the friendly proletariats from their oppression."
jacobinism_subtype:0 "Red Jacobinism"
jacobinism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Jacobinism)§!\n\nThe so-called 'Red Jacobins' represent the larger of the two factions composing the French Communist Party, commonly known as the Jacobin faction within the Commune. Led by the 'Son of the People' who worked his way up as an example to others from the lowest strata of society, Maurice Thorez, the mainstream of the French Communists upholds the orthodoxy as outlined by Marx and expanded upon by V.I. Lenin. Yet much to the surprise of some people who still remember Lenin calling Robespierre a 'Bolshevik avant la lettre', the 'Reds' enhance their Communist doctrine with the legacy of the Cordeliers, Enragés, Hébertists and Sans-Culottes. In such groups of the Great Revolution they find the beginnings of true Socialist thought, focusing on the urban proletariat and the poor workers, distrustful of the corrupting power of the political office and rabid anti-clericalism, going as far as drowning the clergy in rivers to liberate the mass from the opiate and grant them the Cult of Reason. Thorez also draws much from the proto-Communist 'Conspiracy of the Equals' led by François-Noël Babeuf whose legacy was carried to the First Paris Commune by the Neo-Babouvists. Thus, with the uniquely French Revolutionary legacy in one hand and the pure science of Marx and Lenin in the other, the Red PCF aims to establish a true Dictatorship of the Proletariat based on the principles of Democratic Centralism, ardent in class warfare, dogmatic in total unity and submission of the entire Left to the party, and ready to transform the French worker into a New Socialist Man prepared to carry the torch of the Revolution so brutally dimmed by the reactionary enemy."
esoteric_leninism_subtype:0 "Left Roerichism"
esoteric_leninism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Roerichism)§!\n\nLeft Roerichism - also called Leftist Agni Yoga Thought, Esoteric Leninism, or Buddho-Communism - is a mutation of the original ‘Rerikhism’ of Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena inspired by the whispers of the mahatmas and the impressive humanitarian efforts of Vladmir Lenin and other prominent Socialists across the world that have fought to free humanity from oppression. Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Linked to various other ideological movements from National Syndicalism to Black Supremacism to Afrocentric Pacifism, what it means to be African in the Afrofuture can vary, but being declared a true African in any Afrofuturist society grants all the populist benefits such a title could bring. Usually radical and fiercely devoted to its Pan-African and Futurist goals bordering on millenarianism or zealotry, these groups will stop at nothing to achieve the Afrofuture."

A mix of Authoritarianism and pure Socialist Democracy, Popular Communism seeks to safeguard the Revolution without resorting to infighting, excess violence, brutal repressions and reprisals, and other inhumane practices. Supported by craft unions and guilds but against communization and Anarchist-influenced cooperatives, Popular Communism centralizes the economy and the state in sound hands while still allowing self-management and autonomous freedoms for the working class, and usually seeks to find a balance between Agrarian and Industrialist pursuits."

Though not inherently, Left Pan-Africanism is frequently militaristic, and each particular strain’s dedication to the wider World Revolution or other Leftist goals outside Africa is varied, but not all are so solely concerned on African-only affairs. Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Onyango Obama, Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, and many others, and is one of the fastest growing new ideologies on Earth."

With time he came to believe that Anarchists, Syndicalists, Sorelians, Jacobins and Charterites are nothing but traitors to the revolutionary struggle, one which Vladimir Lenin was the greatest champion of. Thus, Hoxhaists' main goal is the preservation of V.I. Lenin's legacy and creation of the most scientific and anti-revisionist form of Marxism-Leninism. They also combine that with a fierce drive to transform Albania into a truly communist country, reforge its culture from a reactionary mess of contradictions into a proud socialist-patriotic tradition.

Uplifting one or a few specific cultures in Europe, or uplifting them all into a cohesive whole, the ‘nationalist’ aspect of Left Pan-European thought can vary greatly as different groups push cultural nationalism, civic nationalism, ethnic nationalism, or other identities to rally around and divide by. Though many Leftist Paneuropeans differ in which specific type of Socialism they wish to unite Europe under, from Communism and Syndicalism to Social Nationalism and Democratic Socialism, all Paneuropeans can agree that the Europe must be protected and preserved under the light of Socialism if their civilization is to survive the coming storm of modernity."

As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia. There are no laws, no gods, and no masters in Illegalist societes, for laws and moral authorities only serve to shackle mankind and keep them from true freedom and equality."

This ideology combines the essence of Cossack identity and heritage with the principles of socialism, creating a distinct socialist system of governance. Drawing inspiration from national-oriented communist movements such as National-Communism, the Red Cossack Dictatorship emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preserving national and cultural peculiarities within the framework of Marxist and communist principles. It rejects cosmopolitanism and globalization, advocating instead for the preservation and autonomy of a Cossack culture. While the Red Cossack Dictatorship shares some similarities with military dictatorships, it maintains a distinctive leftist orientation and a focus on achieving socialist objectives. It may exhibit less authoritarianism and militarism compared to other socialist regimes. Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued. The Red Cossack Dictatorship aims to uphold the rights and interests of the Cossack class while pursuing socialist ideals within a national context."

The main aims of Neo-Socialism are to usher in a 'Constructive Revolution', using the mass popular mandate to establish an authoritarian technocratic government of experts that would plan out society's transformation into a system that old Socialism has failed to achieve. The destructive ideas of class struggle are to be replaced by class collaboration and national solidarity, the anti-capitalist rhetoric increased and existing union institutions subjugated to fit the aims of Neosocialism. In case of Déat's uniquely French implementation, the PSdF also sees itself as the true Jacobins, fighting tirelessly against the phantasmagoric mockery provided by Thorez and his ilk while also combating Anarchists and their chaos-spreading ways.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth and protecting the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist-Leninist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

Anti-democratic and abstentionist to the core, seeing the incorporation of Social Democratic and Right Opposition movements as a capitulation to capitalism and counterrevolutionary currents, Bordigists refute any participation in elections, and instead support the Leninist idea of a dictatorship of the proletariat (despite also heavily criticizing Lenin himself) along with organic centralism while rejecting the totalitarian nature seen in some surviving post-Bolshevik movements, positioning themselves as the true Left Communist scions of modern Marxism while holding the view that most Socialist governments of the post-Great War era have only been extending the liberal and bourgeois nature of prior revolutions that have since degenerated, as all had in common a policy of expropriation, along with agrarian and productive development, which Bordiga considered negations of previous conditions as opposed to the genuine construction of true Socialism from a unique and revolutionary source. Refusing to split the idea of Communism and Socialism as many Leninists do, Bordigists instead views Socialism as an unmatured and undeveloped form of Communism born from a Capitalist nation that must slowly mature into a Communist state, likening his definition of Socialism to Marx’s concept of lower-phase Communism that needs shepherding by vanguardist force on the road to true Communism. Against notions of personality cults or united fronts that only compromise the Communist message, Bordigists still hold some loyalty to the idea of Socialist Internationalism, and though no Bordigist would openly call themselves a Trotskyist, their movements do hold some tangential links and similar beliefs. Sometimes called Italian ‘Ultra-Leftism’ as a way to refer to their anti-Bolshevik, anti-Syndicalist, anti-Anarchist, and anti-Social Democratic ways along with their hatred for electoralism, technocratism, unionism, councilism, opportunism, liberalism, and reformism - instead banking on the natural and sudden spark of organic revolution as triggered by the proletarian masses with help from the vanguard - Bordgisits refuse compromise, cooperation, and the concept of slowly acclimating the proletariat and wider society to their radical ways in order to force the mass good of their ‘unique’ Communist theory onto Italian society as rapidly as possible."

The thoughtform was first officialized and outlined in Marinetti's Manifesto del Futurismo with help from other artists who worked alongside Marinetti in the original futurist group formerly centered in Milan, like Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. The movement at its core is an artistically-driven rejection of the past that seeks to unshackle the nation from any former identity in order to actualize the realization of a perfected future form, with Italian Futurism specifically glorifying modernity and the possibility and motion of an unknown and aesthetically-evolved future over any common sources of Italian traditionalism like the Renaissance or the Romans, with the goal to liberate Italy from the weight of its past entirely so as to fly into the boundless possibly of tomorrow. Despite being one of the most famous interventionist proponents alongside Benitto Mussolini, with whose National Revolutionary Bloc Marinetti has aligned after the establishment of the Socialist Republic, the unique 'Futurist Political Party' has outlined its own truly revolutionary programme separate from the likes of Charterist National-Syndicalism. In their political manifesto 'Democrazia Futurista', followers of the great artist have called for violent and precise anti-clericalism, abolition of the military in favour of light volunteer force, destruction of marriage in favour of nationalized upbringing of children and tax on free love, mass de-bureaucratization, full equality between the genders, Georgist inspired land reform, and a system of proportional reprensenation leading to the election of a technical one chamber government constituted by twenty members under 30 years of age representing all important social strata fairly. With all of their proposals, the Left Futurists aim to tear down the current order full of criminals and reactionaries both on the Right and on the Left, and where socialists and anarchists have always refused to wage war, in order to bring about 'the only hygiene of the world' as the Futurists have termed it. Although their nature is highly egalitarian and opposed to totalitarian modes of state, in recent years - owing to the shape Italy has found itself in - a radical wing centered around long-time Futurist Giuseppe Bottai has begun to grow, borrowing much from the National-Syndicalists and aligning with foreign supremacist movements."

The in a way counter-Charterists have been called to action by what they see as a long developing betrayal of the Syndicalist and Socialist ideals, ultimately resulting in crazed Totalitarianism bent on destruction of everything that they oppose, the Reformists instead often seek to return to the principles outlined exactly in such documents as Carnaro's, guaranteeing a model of collective sovereignty for all citizens regardless of sex, race, language, class, or religion, with institutions infused by Anarcho-Syndicalism and lessons from the cards of Urban Medieval Italian and Athenian Democratic history.

Publishing his new theses in the newspaper 'La Verita', modeled after the former Bolshevik newspaper 'Pravda', the failure of the Leninist Revolution and the triumphant proclamation of the Socialist Republic in Torino have deeply influenced Bombacci, leaving both the corpse of the PSI and the divided PCd'I in favour of exclaiming the virtue of what he saw as the true movement of workers, a movement to which the most militant from his environment gravitated, a movement led by a man he shares a lot of history with from their younger days. Massimalismo has borrowed much from Mussolinism, merging the doctrines of National Syndicalism with Marxism and writing of V.I Lenin, yet replacing aspects of both. Where the Totalists shun the Vanguard Party, Bombacci sees the revitalized state of the nation hopefully ushered in by the Charter as the only way for a successful Vanguard to be formed after the events of the Russian Civil War. Where the Marxists call for seizing the means of production, National Maximalists yearn for the 'socialization of the economy', a concept developed by Edmondo Cione. The movement led by Bombacci has been notably compared to the National Jacobin faction inside the Commune, especially by a fellow Communist now sympathizing with Totalism Henri Guilbeaux, who sees the fastest growing radical leftist ideology as the only way to usher in a true International Revolution, one that Trotsky failed to achieve. Yet true heirs to Marx, to Lenin the martyr of Socialism, people like Benito Mussolini can rouse the masses and achieved true Communism.

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern.

Lenin and many Black American and Caribbean thinkers the likes of George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Du Bois and Father Divine just to name a few.

Leftist Feminists often fight not only for the emancipation of their gender and equal rights, but often for the rights of all people in a hopefully fairer future society. While active in parties and groups ranging from Anarchism through Syndicalism to Marxism and even National Syndicalism, most congregate inside the biggest Socialist parties in a given nation. Despite these being predominantly run by men, they welcome the Feminists as just another part of their Revolution, although there have been cases of political bureaus striking against representatives of Socialist Feminism on account of supposed 'ideological deviation'."

This new Fascism advocates a rejection of exclusively Meridional Nationalism and a return to the ideals of a unified Peninsula, along with mass engagement of the lower classes with politics, Representative Democracy, and a devoutly-Christian Agrarian Socialist model of society. Swearing to abolish poverty and exploitation of the working class and peasantry while expanding and safeguarding equal rights for all citizens, this syncretic movement seeks to unify the Italian people and heal the scars left by the collapse of the Nation.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart.

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob that - who hold that their crimes were an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement inline with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no moral basis and that such illegal acts were pursued due to one’s own personal desires and not some higher ideal. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth and protecting the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique.

Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

While the authority of generals and soldiers now starts to supplant the authority of commissars and secretaries, the Red Junta will do its utmost to remove perceived corrupt civilian bureaucrats and subversive elements that would misuse the revolutionary government's wheels of power for their own ends. This removal typically involves a deeply autocratic police state and waves of martial build-up so that the junta's power may eventually morph into something less militant once the deeds are done, or, in less generous regimes, for the junta to permanently solidify its grip on the nation. Despite this new wave of militant authoritarianism, however, socialist governance commonly remains in Red Juntas alongside the crackdowns, with the lower classes still afforded the welfare and various protections they were promised before the junta's assent into power."

Tracing its roots as far back as to the writings of the highly influential Revolutionary Syndicalist Georges Sorel, and then later developed by many Interventionist Socialist movements such as the Italian 'Leagues of Revolutionary Action', National Syndicalism aims to reform society to the extent which has never been attempted or done before by any regime, government nor even religion. This, according to its proponents, can only be achieved by the mobilization of a truly mass movement of workers, one that shall be a true vanguard of the revolution and reject the delusions of the vanguardist party which has brought the failed revolutionary Lenin to the dustbin of history. Such a force shall overthrow the corrupt and decadent order, of democracy, bourgeoisie and aristocracy, and usher in the total transformation of many a 'plutocratic' nations into true Proletarian Nations, emboldened in their productive, morally vigorous character thus aimed towards grander purposes through maximum cohesion, concentration of forces, iron discipline and utter ruthlessness. Economically, the ideals of National Syndicalism will unite economic classes into a program of national development and growth, enabled by the socialization of the economy and either united national character of various trade unions or one over-union serving the state. The Class War cannot unify the nation, and thus shall be replaced by Class Rejuvenation combining the forces of the lower and increasingly drawn towards Totalism middle class, together with unifying Imperialism yet combined with the Brotherhood of Nations, adhering to and respecting the Charter. Ultimately, the ideology which has been codified in the 'Totalist Charter' mainly drafted by Benito Mussolini, Italy's 'Dux Bellorum' who has galvanized the Socialists towards the First War; former British Conservative, visionary noble and founder of the Maximist group Oswald Mosley; and the intellectual of the Sorelians within the CGT Georges Valois, is often modified and unique to the specific character of the nation in which it is implemented, molded by the absolute and charismatic Totalitarian Socialist guidance of the Chairman."

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern. Consciencism is, above all, a great display of syncretism, combining the Euro-Christian, Islamic and original African influences with the works of Karl Max, V.I. Lenin and many Black American and Caribbean thinkers the likes of George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Du Bois and Father Divine just to name a few. According to Nkrumah's closest associates, his philosophy is a Socialism of a non-atheist kind, meant to implement what all true religions teach yet not supplant them. That is freedom, unity, dignity and the right to self-determination of all peoples, all emboldened by Consciencism's view that pre-colonial Africa was a long of communalism and egalitarianism, values which can be brought back despite the damage the European institutions wrecked upon them. The critics of Ghana's rising star argue that Nkrumaism is nothing more than a mere cult of personality, reliant on one-party democratic centralism and populist state ownership policies while dressing the purely Utopian nature of its socialism in the supposed trappings of 'Scientific' Marxian elements.

Pallais, as a dissident priest suspended by the conservative Church establishment over his social Catholic activism among the poor and destitute communities represents the continuation of the liberal tendencies of many early Modernist creators. The most profound recent influence on Modernismo Nicaragüense, however, is de la Selva's interweaving of soft Syndicalist views into the mostly literature based movement, influenced by both his contact with the American Federation of Labor's leader Samuel Gompers and Frida Kahlo's partner Diego Rivera, together with expressed support for many actions of the government established by the great revolutionary Augusto César Sandino.

The origins of National Communism can be found among the various minority activists within the Bolshevik movement, such as Ukraine's Vasyl Shakhrai, Tatarstan's Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev and Crimea's Ismail Firdevs, who became disillusioned with the continuation of cultural chauvinism so ever-present during the oppressive imperial era. Another important voice in the melding of national interests with communism, unrelated to the groups which operated within the Russian Communist Party, is the Borotbist movement led by Alexander Shumsky. National Communists carry the torch of Marx while noting that his position of workers having 'no country' refers to the globalized bourgeoisie states, machines for exploitation against which the policy of full independence or wide national autonomy in cooperation with new Socialist cores ought to be employed. For true Socialism, touching upon every aspect of local tradition, cannot be achieved unless the 'colonized' groups break the chains of their metropolitan masters. While to many Communists every National Communist represents a certain 'national deviation', the tendency itself does not merge its goals with explicit nationalism represented by the usual meaning of such term. That is not to say certain groups do not increase their reliance on the 'national' part of their ideology. The National Communist term has also been applied to Marxist thinkers which do advocate an alliance with rabidly nationalistic and chauvinistic groups inside their nations, much to the chagrin of conventional representative of the ideology who call such positions 'Social-Reactionism', the most famous of them being the German Communist Heinrich Laufenberg, who developed the idea described by him as 'National Bolshevism'.

Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

This ideology combines the essence of Cossack identity and heritage with the principles of socialism, creating a distinct socialist system of governance. Drawing inspiration from national-oriented communist movements such as National-Communism, the Red Cossack Dictatorship emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preserving national and cultural peculiarities within the framework of Marxist and communist principles. It rejects cosmopolitanism and globalization, advocating instead for the preservation and autonomy of a Cossack culture. While the Red Cossack Dictatorship shares some similarities with military dictatorships, it maintains a distinctive leftist orientation and a focus on achieving socialist objectives. It may exhibit less authoritarianism and militarism compared to other socialist regimes. Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued. The Red Cossack Dictatorship aims to uphold the rights and interests of the Cossack class while pursuing socialist ideals within a national context."

The most popular currents within the broader movement are Anarcha-Feminism, pioneered by Teresa Mañé, Emma Goldman, and Itō Noe; and Marxist Feminism, with its most popular advocates being Alexandra Kollontai, Clara Zetkin, and Mary Inman. Leftist Feminists often fight not only for the emancipation of their gender and equal rights, but often for the rights of all people in a hopefully fairer future society. While active in parties and groups ranging from Anarchism through Syndicalism to Marxism and even National Syndicalism, most congregate inside the biggest Socialist parties in a given nation. Despite these being predominantly run by men, they welcome the Feminists as just another part of their Revolution, although there have been cases of political bureaus striking against representatives of Socialist Feminism on account of supposed 'ideological deviation'."

bahai_universalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Baha’i Universalism)§!\n\nBaha’i Universalism is the informal designation given to syncretic and varied ideology created by fusing Socialist ideas with the tenets of the Baha’i and earlier Bábí faiths and the teachings of their founders Bahá'u'lláh and Báb respectively. First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth and protecting the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist-Leninist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

Grounded in the belief that there is only one source of authority that any and all Christians are ultimately answerable to - being God himself and his wider teachings embodied in Jesus Christ - this specific breed of Leftism believes that it is only moral, pious, and just to reject all other forms of earthly authority such as the State, seeing these sources of human-based authority to be innately violent, deceitful, unjust, and idolatrous. Furthermore, Christian Anarchism holds that the concept of a ‘Kingdom of God’ - or more broadly the creation of a pious stateless society bound by humanistic and egalitarian Christian social teachings - is the only proper expression of the relationship between God and humanity, characterizing human relationships under such a ‘Kingdom’ by horizontal organization, servant leadership, and universal compassion, and not through the traditional, and often oppressive, structures of organized religion, which most Christian anarchists consider hierarchical and or otherwise authoritarian in nature. Additionally, most Christian Anarchists are also pacifists who reject war, militarism, and the use of violence even if revolutionary in nature, though their economic ideas and proclivity to industrial urbanism and Syndicalisms or agrarian ruralism and Anarchist Democracy can vary, though most Christian Anarchist movements pull heavily from the Leo Tolstoy’s ‘The Kingdom of God is Within You’ as well as the Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount of the Bible. Overall, Christian Anarchists believe in one God and one master in Heaven while rejecting all other forms of authority, hierarchy, inequality, and statism borne from earthly or human sources in order to build an egalitarian and free communalist society under God. Among the most popular existing movements espousing Christian Anarchism today are the Catholic Worker Movement organized by the American social activist Dorothy Day and Nomadelfia, a community situated within the territory of the Papal States established by father Zeno Saltini."

The thoughtform was first officialized and outlined in Marinetti's Manifesto del Futurismo with help from other artists who worked alongside Marinetti in the original futurist group formerly centered in Milan, like Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. The movement at its core is an artistically-driven rejection of the past that seeks to unshackle the nation from any former identity in order to actualize the realization of a perfected future form, with Italian Futurism specifically glorifying modernity and the possibility and motion of an unknown and aesthetically-evolved future over any common sources of Italian traditionalism like the Renaissance or the Romans, with the goal to liberate Italy from the weight of its past entirely so as to fly into the boundless possibly of tomorrow. Despite being one of the most famous interventionist proponents alongside Benitto Mussolini, with whose National Revolutionary Bloc Marinetti has aligned after the establishment of the Socialist Republic, the unique 'Futurist Political Party' has outlined its own truly revolutionary programme separate from the likes of Charterist National-Syndicalism. In their political manifesto 'Democrazia Futurista', followers of the great artist have called for violent and precise anti-clericalism, abolition of the military in favour of light volunteer force, destruction of marriage in favour of nationalized upbringing of children and tax on free love, mass de-bureaucratization, full equality between the genders, Georgist inspired land reform, and a system of proportional reprensenation leading to the election of a technical one chamber government constituted by twenty members under 30 years of age representing all important social strata fairly. With all of their proposals, the Left Futurists aim to tear down the current order full of criminals and reactionaries both on the Right and on the Left, and where socialists and anarchists have always refused to wage war, in order to bring about 'the only hygiene of the world' as the Futurists have termed it. Although their nature is highly egalitarian and opposed to totalitarian modes of state, in recent years - owing to the shape Italy has found itself in - a radical wing centered around long-time Futurist Giuseppe Bottai has begun to grow, borrowing much from the National-Syndicalists and aligning with foreign supremacist movements."

Sharing the argument that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, that its predecessor was formed around, Leftist Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays along with the very notion of an ideological spectrum in order to ensure absolute socio-economic security for its populace, though the ideology is still split between more egalitarian and broad humanitarian cliques like those seen in the Ireland, or in places the United States with Robert Heinlein and New Zealand with John A.

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern.

Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy.

Sometimes also called Ryutinism due to the paramount advocate of such system being Martemyan Ryutin, Market-Leninism serves as both a continuator and breaker of the party's platform. Ryutin believes that the forces advocating quicker industrialization and chauvinistic centralism were not properly kept in check by the majority of the party, and thus the current doctrinal focus has to be reconsidered. Thus, among the key tenants of Ryutinism is reassigned emphasis on the rural communities and greater outreach towards the minorities of the Union, ones willing to excel in a newly minted people's meritocracy. Yet the most vital aspect of the ideology is a realization that true Socialism and the will of V.I. Lenin can only be preserved by existing as part of the Capitalism World, for it has triumphed over many crises and laid bare the shortcomings of purely Communistic states. That's why a new approach, a combined socio-economic advance of the Market and Leninism shall ensure the progress and prosperity of the entire proletariat. Thus, the policies of 'Capitalism in the Village' shall be extended and also replace the 'Socialism in the City', galvanizing the owner class to build up the country's advancement while creating competition for the state's capitalistic experiments. Despite such a turn it does not mean the lowest classes shall be abandoned, quite the opposite. For the rich shall be overseen by the administration to ensure they uphold the ideals of philanthropy and strive to create urban cooperatives amongst the workers. Thus Market-Leninism aims to ensure that culturally the Marxist thought advanced by Lenin shall once again become paramount while economically a new Soviet middle class shall be born, following Premier Bukharin's words adopted from François Guizot.

While a member of the Russian Communist Party during the Civil War and one of the leaders of the Muslim Socialist Committee of Kazan, Soltanğäliev became concerned with the problem of the replacement of the exploiter imperial core, led by bourgeoisie, with the international proletariat which could devolve to the same role. According to him, only through a united dictatorship of the 'colonies and half-colonies' over the 'metropole' can the chains that bind the oppressed nations, such as the entire Muslim world, be finally broken. Despite combining that view with the position that dialectical materialism was developed not only in Europe, but also in the nations of the East, thus rejecting mindless copying of everything the Occidental Marxists transport onto his world, Mirsäyet is entirely willing to accept a unified front with the poor masses of all of Russia to bring true Socialism about. To that extent the creation of a Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic, or even pan-Turania governed by the rules of democratic centralism, is meant as either an autonomous ally of the Russian Socialist Republic, or even the final reserve of the Revolution guarding against the renewed bourgeoisie from the imperial core, trying to destroy the Tatar identity, as well as the reactionaries of China and India. In the worst Just like the Jadidists, to which his father belong, are concerned with the reform of their Islamic societies so does Soltanğäliev outlines an extensive plan for progress within the Muslim world. To the Tatar revolutionary the term 'Muslim' refers to a shared cultural background, and not a religion meant to be preserved for he still adhered to the Marxist doctrine of atheism. Yet the method in which Islam ought to be fought has to be different from combating Christianity, for the youngest Abrahamic faith already upholds many aspects compatible with orthodox Communism while suffering from a high degree of clerical influence. Due to such mix of views Soltangalievism serves as a paramount example for both nascent Marxist colonial liberation movements so concerned with the fight against the metropolitan masters, especially inside the Muslim world, as well as the thinkers espousing National Communism."

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary. Ultimately, the political creation of Huey Long is a personalist vehicle not unlike those in Southern America, being everything to his die-hard supporters, while willing to borrow and utilize any idea that will ensure continued dominance of the AFP, Huey Long and ensure that every man can be king."

Born during the Industrial Revolution in England and Germany but now increasingly common outside the Western World such as in Latin America or Africa where the rules and expectations of European-biased Socialisms do not apply, these strange systems seek to build moral, Conservative societies usually, but not always, rooted in theist ethics, Conservative welfare economics, class collaboration and cooperation, and/or ideas of Civic Nationalism and non-extremist Nationalist Patriotism. Often linked to ideas of Market Socialism, Christian Distributism, charity economics, Bismarck's State Socialism and economic interventionism, Red Toryism, and other wealth-sharing programs, Paternal Socialists seek to build egalitarian, non-predatory economic systems geared against ideas of class struggle that fuse Capitalist and Socialist ideas in a Consevative and Paternalistic package for the good of their usually traditionalist and nationalist peoples while undermining and weakening normal Socialist and Leftist movements to preserve tradition and societal stability, even if that puts them at odds with other Socialists or Conservatives around the globe."

Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Reformist Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic piety, Social Catholicism or non-Revolutionary Socialist Welfare, Belgian Unitarianism, and the cultivation of a uniquely Belgian culture and identity, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently tied to any one political group, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, from the Reformed and Humanitarian Rexists of Hergé to the Humanist Capitalists of Buisseret and the Socialist Belgicists of Dehousse."

Revolving around the theories of Permanent Revolution in opposition to the Two-Stage theory of achieving Communism as professed by his opponents, support for social revolution in nations still yet awoken to Socialist ideas through working-class mass action in order to cause Capitalist collapse, political revolution in ‘degenerated workers’ states’ already open to the ideas of Socialism, the use of a transitional programme of demands that bridge between daily struggles of the working class and the maximal ideas of the socialist transformation of society, and of course, the support for Proletarian Internationalism, hence its contemporary name.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob that - who hold that their crimes were an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement inline with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no moral basis and that such illegal acts were pursued due to one’s own personal desires and not some higher ideal. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

Calling for social safety nets and minimalist welfare systems, Progressive Conservatism seeks to improve society without radical or rapid changes to the established status quo and traditions, and is often tied to Catholic social teaching, Christian democracy, and even the papal literary work ‘Rerum novarum’ which calls for a form of Catholic conservative progressivism in order to safeguard the Christian working masses against the predation of Socialism.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

scandinavism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Scandinavism)§!\n\nScandinavism, or Pan-Scandinavianism, is a ideology that supports various degrees of cooperation among the Scandinavian countries first born among literary, linguistic, and cultural movements that has since coalesced and developed into the usual idea of total Scandinavian national and political unity, preferably peacefully and under a constitutional monarchy. Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered. Regardless, the Pan-Scandinavian dream must be achieved, and through equal cooperation and shared destiny, the dream of a peaceful and prosperous Scandinavia bound by our shared Nordic Spirit will be earned as the Three Sisters gradually grow closer and closer together."
liberal_socialism_subtype:0 "Liberal Socialism"
liberal_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Liberal Socialism)§!\n\nLiberal Socialism is an ideology created and popularized largely within British and Italian circles that incorporates liberal democratic principles to non-Marxist socialism, as seen in British Labour and the writings of John Stuart Mill - who theorized that capitalist societies should experience a gradual process of socialization through worker-controlled enterprises that coexisted with private enterprises while rejecting centralized models of socialism that he thought might discourage competition and creativity, arguing that representation is essential in a free government and democracy could not subsist if economic opportunities were not well distributed, therefore conceiving democracy not just as a form of representative government but as an entire social organization that has since come to be the foundation of Liberal Socialist thought - or the Italian Action Party of Carlo Rosselli, though it has also seen success in other places across the Anglosphere and wider world, being similar to certain American concepts of non-Marxist libertarian socialism as well as the works of the French Catholic priest and educator Jean-Baptiste de La Salle. This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

In opposition to the monarchy-favouring liberals of Benedetto Croce and the dictatorial marxists of Antonio Gramsci, Concretismo combines secularist aspects from the Age of Enlightenment, liberalism and socialism. Salvemini has long rallied against the corrupt political machines specifically keeping the South poor in an effort to bind the local political class to their interests, and thus advocates for far-reaching economic and social reform to uplift the Mezzogiorno from destitution. Presenting his ideas as a third way between conservative-liberal order and the dictatorship of revolutionary socialism, Gaetano Salvemini sees the reconstruction of whole Italy as only possible through universal suffrage, humanitarian socialism, implementation of a democratic republic based on the ideals of social justice, national self-determination for Italians in occupied territories and democratic interventionism abroad, meant to awaken Italy's consciousness and make the people rediscover and reconsider their democratic roots. While Salvemini sees a future in a reunified Italy, as his life goes on Concretismo has begun developing a noticeable and harsh anti-Northernern slant, even with calls to permanently separate Sicily from the Peninsula and calling the House of Savoy 'pigs in tuxedos'."

In recent years 'Jermanism' began to coalesce into a semi-concrete form of ideology, due to the influence of neighbouring leftist groups like the ones in India or China, and thus began advocating for separation of religion and state while still respecting the right to worship, council communalism in a semi-anarchist organization of the state, full removal of the hierarchical backwardness steeped in Kazi dominated class system, ecological and agrarian socialism, incorporating existing tribal structures into the functions of a modernized state and most importantly creating a cohesive syncretic culture uniting all of the diverse groups that call Sikkim their home into one 'Sikkimese' identity.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth and protecting the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Hinging around the practice of Satyāgraha - meaning ‘holding firmly to the truth’ or the Truth Force, which is the particular form of nonviolent or civil resistance employed by the Indian independence movement and other similar forces, Gandhists and the Satyagrahi utilize peaceful means to resist the governments, regimes, and policies they deem tyrannical in order to indirectly achieve progressive reform and societal change without needless bloodshed, only lashing out in self-defense when absolutely necessary as a life-saving last resort - though this self-defense clause is highly controversial with many followers of Mohandas K. Gandhi rejecting it in favor of total non-violence or Ahimsa. Additionally, Gandhism teaches egalitarian religious unity, especially between Hindus and Muslims who long have ravaged the region with their violent rivalries (though the Mahātmā created these unifying ideas through a Hindu lens with Brahmacharya in mind while his friend Abdul Ghaffar Khan did so through a Muslim lens with the Pashtunwali in mind), while also fostering nonviolent passions of patriotism and varied breeds of nationalism, upholding inalienable human rights and freedoms, and advocating for asceticism, fasting, and vegetarianism or veganism. Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. Though shunned as a term by its ‘creators’ and not a true ideology in the eyes of the Mahātmā or Sarhadi Gandhi, Gandhism is nonetheless a strong political, cultural, and spiritual influencer across Southern Asia and beyond as Gandhians across the globe stand up for peaceful progress without resorting to violence outside self-defense."

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity.

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries dividend along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World. Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

However, Mazzini himself and his ideology still support the Christian faith and wider spirituality, just believing it has no place within the functions of state, while also actively fighting against ideas of both Church elitism and radical atheism, as well as against the rampant selfish individualism commonly seen in other liberal republics that the ideology partially takes inspiration from, like the United States. For Mazzinists, a true republic is a place where freedom and justice can be achieved for all people - even non-Italians living in Italy and abroad based on Mazzini’s principle of a brotherhood or association of all mankind, and this ideal is pursued by walking a middle line of liberal compromise while maintaining a firm stance against both syndicalist and reactionary extremism.

This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Reformist Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic piety, Social Catholicism or non-Revolutionary Socialist Welfare, Belgian Unitarianism, and the cultivation of a uniquely Belgian culture and identity, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently tied to any one political group, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, from the Reformed and Humanitarian Rexists of Hergé to the Humanist Capitalists of Buisseret and the Socialist Belgicists of Dehousse."

Though not as established, historic, or rooted in ideology as true democracies, Democratic Warlordist systems still work to at least partially enfranchise the local population to some varying, usually small degree (often only giving the right to ‘vote’ to lower members of the organization and their families and friends, but more rarely to the wider population), while giving the masses support and some form of say in the soldier-for-hire-led government they live within, usually all to ensure the junta stays in control but rarely out of the humanism or kindness of the leading group.

This idea of Pan-Māori unity however is far from united itself, with varied kotahitanga sub-movements seeking to unite the tangata whenua - or ‘people of the land’ - using a myriad of possible unifying factors over the years; be it religion, democratic parliamentarianism, shared history and culture, an attempt at fostering modern Māori nationalism, or some other nebulous factor. Now, the Pan-Māori idea is largely championed by the elective monarchist Kīngitanga movement, started by the Waikato Tainui tribal waka confederation of Te Ika-a-Māui under first Māori King Pōtatau Te Wherowhero in the 1850s. They now stand as the main, but not only, group carrying the modern kotahitanga torch as they try to unite the various iwi of Aotearoa under a shared ‘Te Kīngi’ of the elected Te Wherowhero dynasty.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

First theorized by German socialist theorist Ferdinand Lassale with his idea of the Nachtwächterstaat - a system inspired by the watchman system of public-organized militias separate from the government that protected towns and cities starting in Europe’s medieval period - Minarchism treads the line between State and Statelessness, arguing that Anarcho-Capitalism and other forms of total Anarchism are impractical as they cannot enforce the non-aggression principle, while total State control strips liberty and freedom from all beneath its gaze. As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

The ideological beginnings of British Conservatism are believed to be the Cavalier faction of the English Civil War, with later centuries bringing the influence of Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger. Policy-wise Toryism is characterized as highly socially-conservative, deeply Anglican, anti-liberal and very often pro-monarchist. In terms of the economy, it often fluctuates between supporting a free-market or protectionism, with many internal schisms fought over that issue.

marlib_scandinavism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Scandinavism)§!\n\nScandinavism, or Pan-Scandinavianism, is a ideology that supports various degrees of cooperation among the Scandinavian countries first born among literary, linguistic, and cultural movements that has since coalesced and developed into the usual idea of total Scandinavian national and political unity, preferably peacefully and under a constitutional monarchy. Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered. Regardless, the Pan-Scandinavian dream must be achieved, and through equal cooperation and shared destiny, the dream of a peaceful and prosperous Scandinavia bound by our shared Nordic Spirit will be earned as the Three Sisters gradually grow closer and closer together."

A considerable influence on various thinkers across the entire ideological line from Antonio Gramsci to Giovanni Gentile, Croce has been the head of the Italian Liberal Party after Giovanni Giolitti, the controversial former prime minister died. Liberalism of the Spirit agrees that the individual is the basis of society, but rejects the idea of social atomism, seeing the individual as something more than just a collection of self-interests. For Croce liberalism does not have to necessarily involve fixed legitimate powers, nor Capitalism, for if another system, even Socialism which contribution to the Italian independence struggle Croce highly admires, would still advance liberty it has a legitimate place in society. This has lead Benedetto to separate liberalism from laissez-faire attitude to economics which he dubbed as liberism. For Aesthetic Liberals, following the thinker's Aesthetic Expressivism idea art representing emotions, there is no Lockean natural right to liberty, for it is granted by the continued vigilance against oppressive barbarism, led not by the absurd egalitarian notion but by true liberal aristocrats, the few which can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty. All of the things that the great mass of citizens will benefit but not fully comprehend. Croce's stance towards religion could be described as pantheistic or even agnostic while culturally Christian, although he sees religion as merely a stepping stone on the road of studying the science, that is a philosophical inquiry into the science of the spirit."

Literally meaning 'Whoeverism', the term has been adopted by the movement in a sort of mockery against the supposedly 'politically aware' classes that decry this populist anti-establishment stance, best characterized by one of their slogans Abbasso tutti! or 'Down with everyone!'. Giannini sees the State as inherently untrustworthy, having grown tired of its intrusion into people's private lives, and thus advocates for a purely 'technical' government with a single one year term politician that'd work like a dutiful accountant, administrating the minimized state and leaving after his job was done. The day-to-day running of the nation would be left to local committees with clerks directly responsible before the voters. Vowing to fight against both collectivist socialists and the big business capitalists, Qualunquismo advocates outline a reform plan for the nation that would include limits on taxation, removal of the government from social life and enshrinement of individual's economic liberty. Because of these positions, the movement has been compared and sometimes even equated to multiple right libertarian tendencies and ideologies. Surprising many observers, Giannini's Common Man's Front contains certain monarchist tendencies, seemingly seeing a monarch that governs but not rules as acceptable if the choice had to be made between the crown or the disdained ethical imperialists of mass parties. One thing is certain, no established hierarchy can be safe from the criticism and ridicule of this journalist, writer, director, and dramaturge."

To call the Kingfish's programme wide would be an understatement, for his ideological musings combine elements from all sides of the spectrum while tying them together with the aura of populism serving the common folk. Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary. Ultimately, the political creation of Huey Long is a personalist vehicle not unlike those in Southern America, being everything to his die-hard supporters, while willing to borrow and utilize any idea that will ensure continued dominance of the AFP, Huey Long and ensure that every man can be king."

Inspired by the titular progenitor movements present both in Poland and Czech lands, National Democrats are highly popular in newly emerging states; ones created chiefly among the rubble left by the empires of old. Although religion is an important part of their platform and conservative way of thinking permeates, these aspects may be only surface deep and serve as a vehicle to coalesce the national consciousness into one body.

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries dividend along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World. Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

Calling for social safety nets and minimalist welfare systems, Progressive Conservatism seeks to improve society without radical or rapid changes to the established status quo and traditions, and is often tied to Catholic social teaching, Christian democracy, and even the papal literary work ‘Rerum novarum’ which calls for a form of Catholic conservative progressivism in order to safeguard the Christian working masses against the predation of Socialism. In more modern times, the ideology has been practiced and adapted across the world by the likes of former American president Theodore Roosevelt and British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, and now has begun finding contemporary popularity once again as a Conservative alternative to more dangerous and radical Leftist progressivist ideology."

It is deeply rooted in the Kuban People's Republic and the Almighty Don Host, and revolves around the concept of power being concentrated in the hands of the Cossacks. In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence. Unlike traditional democratic ideologies, Cossack Democracy does not aim for broad-based inclusivity. Instead, it emphasizes the preservation and promotion of Cossack interests within a democratic framework."

Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'.

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings. This resistance is driven by the belief that maintaining traditional educational methods is essential for the cohesion and well-being of the Muslim community."

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary.

Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered. Regardless, the Pan-Scandinavian dream must be achieved, and through equal cooperation and shared destiny, the dream of a peaceful and prosperous Scandinavia bound by our shared Nordic Spirit will be earned as the Three Sisters gradually grow closer and closer together."

Literally meaning 'Whoeverism', the term has been adopted by the movement in a sort of mockery against the supposedly 'politically aware' classes that decry this populist anti-establishment stance, best characterized by one of their slogans Abbasso tutti! or 'Down with everyone!'. Giannini sees the State as inherently untrustworthy, having grown tired of its intrusion into people's private lives, and thus advocates for a purely 'technical' government with a single one year term politician that'd work like a dutiful accountant, administrating the minimized state and leaving after his job was done. The day-to-day running of the nation would be left to local committees with clerks directly responsible before the voters. Vowing to fight against both collectivist socialists and the big business capitalists, Qualunquismo advocates outline a reform plan for the nation that would include limits on taxation, removal of the government from social life and enshrinement of individual's economic liberty. Because of these positions, the movement has been compared and sometimes even equated to multiple right libertarian tendencies and ideologies. Surprising many observers, Giannini's Common Man's Front contains certain monarchist tendencies, seemingly seeing a monarch that governs but not rules as acceptable if the choice had to be made between the crown or the disdained ethical imperialists of mass parties.

The Colonel's party remains divided, but agrees on several principles, all united behind their slogan 'Social d'Abord'. Firstly, concerning political matters, the transformation of the parliamentary republic, seen as weak and ineffective, into a strong, legalistic presidential regime where parliamentary unity behind the figure of the president would be self-evident is advocated for. Like the majority of the French right, de la Rocque is in favor of women's suffrage, but also family suffrage, consisting in granting an additional suffrage when a family is formed, i.e. a household with one or more children. An end to the anti-clerical policies of the Radicals and a return to Catholicism as a guide to life, through charity and social aid for example, although the Colonel's supporters are divided between those simply wishing cooperation with the Church and others a full-blown state Catholicism. The promotion of non-ethnic patriotism, the Colonel being notably opposed to anti-Semitism, which is rare in the French political landscape, although some members of his party still hold these views, de la Rocque is also in favor of cooperation between the differents European countries as, in his own words, 'a kind of federation of states belonging to the same civilization, dominated by major common interests'. On the economic front, corporatism and class collaboration are supported, although some criticize the fact that these would mainly favor the industrialists who finance the party, such as François Coty, and a non-radical extension of workers' rights, like the establishment of minimum wage for example.

More unusual of the Chief's thoughts present themselves in the creation of the Commonwealth Corporation, absorbing and subjugating many aspects of private businesses, similarly to the proposed Central Treasury Bank meant to distribute national credit, free universal education, implementation of all treaties with First Americans and the wide utilization of the Silver Legion structures. However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'.

Despite being the son of the wealthy senator, William's electoral journey was at one point connected to the Progressive Movement. Such ideas led him to create the anti-Tammany Municipal Ownership League in NYC and then the Independence Party, calling for end to corrupt politicking, reforms and meritocracy with the help of a wide front of unionists, immigrants and established parties. While ideas like municipal ownership of public utilities and belief in meritocracy, although nowadays seen as support for the most successful wealthy individuals, stayed with Hearst he continued to slide towards conservatism. With the USA in crisis Hearst laid the groundwork for the creation of a new party, the National Democrats promising to combat social ills, substance abuse, crime, the red menace and most importantly the dread of the 'Yellow Peril'. Hearstian Democracy is a system in which the able entrepreneur is upheld as a role model, granted generous benefits of slashed taxation, trade unions are nationalized into a system dubbed 'American Corporatism', socialists, immigrant wastrels perpetuating drug abuse and any other crook are diligently caught by the politicized Federal Police. Beyond that Hearst calls for nationalization of alcohol, an idea influenced by the failure of the dry counties, the conquest of nature to build infrastructure and industry for the Californian Dream, and creation of the National Industrial Organization regulating wages and price gouging while promoting class collaboration. All of this tied with full control over the media, the state apparatus and international isolation, although any traitor and bandit beyond the border will not have the luxury of escaping Hearst's spirit, the same one that called for the war with Spain back in 1898."

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings. This resistance is driven by the belief that maintaining traditional educational methods is essential for the cohesion and well-being of the Muslim community."

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes.

Tracing their roots back to Russia's most powerful Black-Hundredist organization called the Union of the Russian People, the French extreme right League of Patriots organized by Paul Déroulède in support of 'Général Revanche' Georges Ernest Boulanger and the German National Association of Commercial Employees, Legionarism drew from these reactionary, highly militant, anti-socialist, anti-semetic and racially supremacist movements for inspiration. The greatest influences on far-rights' most popular strain after the Weltkrieg are Hungary's Gyula Gömbös and his Szeged Idea, while the most successful and widely emulated party is Romania's Legion of the Archangel Michael, more commonly known as the Iron Guard led by the mystical Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Legionarist parties put the people of their nation, often defined by a shared blood, a common folk hostile to the 'foreign corruptors' inhabiting their lands, on the forefront of their policy. They strive to achieve a mythical 'Palingenesis', a rebirth of their people united by common values such as shared desired for revenge, a strong faith sometimes expressed in a borderline mystical Church or the activation of the vital forces of the youth enrolled into fanatical paramilitaries sharing the renewed nation's guiding principle of self-sacrifice and martyrdom for the common cause. Economically, many have borrowed yet another thing from the ANI, that being Corporatism although other forms of reshaping the economy are also found. Above all, Legionaries detest and combat the 'internal enemies', be they communists, masons, minorities of all kinds and whoever else that has bewitched their pure state, one just now awaking, an element that some of the groups enhanced with scriptures taken from the Legione del Risveglio of the near-otherworldly baron Julius Evola.

As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

Neoborbonists posit that the lands ruled by the House of Bourbon-Naples were at the forefront of cultural and civilizational development, a state which was abruptly cut short by the lack of attention and enshrined destitution brought by the Northerner administration. Not only was the South neglected, it was subject to brutal mass repression and killing campaign targeting civilians under the pretense of combating supposed 'brigandage', despite the so-called briganti being nothing more than true freedom fighters harkening back to the times of resistance against Napoleonic invaders. In terms of political backing resurgent Bourbonism found many allies across the Catholic laity and the clergy still bitter over the Roman Question and emboldened by the fall of the Savoyard kingdom.

Furthermore, Oligarchism can be remarkably different in how it determines who shall wield the power, with some oligarchies having a racial basis for their hierarchy. Oligarchs themselves typically come from backgrounds of immense wealth, causing them to be derided as only caring about their own power over the well-being of the nation itself as they continue to safeguard their capital and remain corrupted with nepotism.

Contemporary Yugoslavism is largely split between two dominant subtypes, being the integrationists who favored integral Yugoslavism while promoting unitarism, centralization, and the rapid total unification of the South Slavic ethnic and linguistic groups into a single Yugoslav nation, even by coercion if necessary, and the federalists which advocated for the autonomy of each slice of historic South Slavic lands in the form of a diverse federation that would slowly work towards total unification at a gradual pace, and without outside pressure.

Firstly, concerning political matters, the transformation of the parliamentary republic, seen as weak and ineffective, into a strong, legalistic presidential regime where parliamentary unity behind the figure of the president would be self-evident is advocated for. Like the majority of the French right, de la Rocque is in favor of women's suffrage, but also family suffrage, consisting in granting an additional suffrage when a family is formed, i.e. a household with one or more children. An end to the anti-clerical policies of the Radicals and a return to Catholicism as a guide to life, through charity and social aid for example, although the Colonel's supporters are divided between those simply wishing cooperation with the Church and others a full-blown state Catholicism. The promotion of non-ethnic patriotism, the Colonel being notably opposed to anti-Semitism, which is rare in the French political landscape, although some members of his party still hold these views, de la Rocque is also in favor of cooperation between the differents European countries as, in his own words, 'a kind of federation of states belonging to the same civilization, dominated by major common interests'. On the economic front, corporatism and class collaboration are supported, although some criticize the fact that these would mainly favor the industrialists who finance the party, such as François Coty, and a non-radical extension of workers' rights, like the establishment of minimum wage for example.

Dzierzgowski posits that monarchy is the form of government most fit to the biological laws that govern the organic world, as can be seen by the self-preservation instinct which clearly crystalizes in the unbroken line of family establishing dynasty then a tribe, a nation and ultimately a state. Such an instinct can also be observed in a parents' love for their offspring, paralleled by the sovereigns attitude to his subjects, a thing which cannot be observed in any democracy for it does not even exist in the natural world. To Scientific Monarchists such a system is not a rule of the people, but their mass psychosis that needs to be eliminated and replaced by people raised from birth to lead a professional nation required in such an advanced era. Dzierzgowski's ideology advocates for a meritocratic society bound by a socio-biological sense of community, enforced by a strong rule of the monarch helped by vital youthful leadership of the best specimens, the utter destruction of democratic delusions and constant combating of disruptive foreign social 'parasites', all tied with the creation of an eugenic programme."

More unusual of the Chief's thoughts present themselves in the creation of the Commonwealth Corporation, absorbing and subjugating many aspects of private businesses, similarly to the proposed Central Treasury Bank meant to distribute national credit, free universal education, implementation of all treaties with First Americans and the wide utilization of the Silver Legion structures. However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'. They would become wards of the state and inducted into the 'ward system', deprived of any benefits the citizens have then relegated to labor jobs until they can be properly educated for entry into the Commonwealth.

Such ideas led him to create the anti-Tammany Municipal Ownership League in NYC and then the Independence Party, calling for end to corrupt politicking, reforms and meritocracy with the help of a wide front of unionists, immigrants and established parties. While ideas like municipal ownership of public utilities and belief in meritocracy, although nowadays seen as support for the most successful wealthy individuals, stayed with Hearst he continued to slide towards conservatism. With the USA in crisis Hearst laid the groundwork for the creation of a new party, the National Democrats promising to combat social ills, substance abuse, crime, the red menace and most importantly the dread of the 'Yellow Peril'. Hearstian Democracy is a system in which the able entrepreneur is upheld as a role model, granted generous benefits of slashed taxation, trade unions are nationalized into a system dubbed 'American Corporatism', socialists, immigrant wastrels perpetuating drug abuse and any other crook are diligently caught by the politicized Federal Police. Beyond that Hearst calls for nationalization of alcohol, an idea influenced by the failure of the dry counties, the conquest of nature to build infrastructure and industry for the Californian Dream, and creation of the National Industrial Organization regulating wages and price gouging while promoting class collaboration. All of this tied with full control over the media, the state apparatus and international isolation, although any traitor and bandit beyond the border will not have the luxury of escaping Hearst's spirit, the same one that called for the war with Spain back in 1898."

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them.

The very basic idea is that the royalty in elective monarchies does not ascend onto the throne by the grace of a divine being itself, but through a compact made by the influential classes and the nobility of their realm. The most famous examples of such entities in history have been the Holy Roman Empire, where the vast network of different feudal realms nonetheless ended up re-electing the same Habsburg family which monopolized the Kaiser's throne, and on the other end of the spectrum the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in which the king was truly subservient to the magnate class which not only held vast lands but also sway among the lower nobility. These two examples illustrate the inherent differences in how elective monarchies around the world are run, for some have become merely a facade that facilitates purely dynastical inheritance, although in a less 'autocratic' way due to the supposed consent of the electors, while in others the appointed monarch is nothing more than a figurehead for the grey eminance behind the throne to do as they please with. A less common, yet very peculiar, trend has also been the creation and transformation of previously existing governments into a sort-of 'crowned republics', where the monarch is chosen by what was formerly the political strata and ultimately serves the same purpose as any president or prime minister, just with the royal decorum instituted upon them."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings.

They strive to achieve a mythical 'Palingenesis', a rebirth of their people united by common values such as shared desired for revenge, a strong faith sometimes expressed in a borderline mystical Church or the activation of the vital forces of the youth enrolled into fanatical paramilitaries sharing the renewed nation's guiding principle of self-sacrifice and martyrdom for the common cause. Economically, many have borrowed yet another thing from the ANI, that being Corporatism although other forms of reshaping the economy are also found.

Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

Ranging from bandit groups with a state to organized military startocracies to even military-backed republican governments or pure dictatorships, Warlordism has less to do with politics and more to do with a lack of clear borders and the ever-present and often chaotic nature of warfare.

pioism_subtype:0 "Padre Pio Thought"
pioism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Padre Pio Thought)§!\n\nBased on the teachings and life of Pio of Pietrelcina, Padre Pio Thought or Pioism is less a formal ideology and more a way of life. Promoting deep faith and obedience to the Catholic Church while at the same time rejecting every form of ideology and even national identity, Padre Pio Thought seeks to create a society where everyone has the best chance to become a saint. It attempts to do this by promoting an incredibly decentralized model of governance, where local authorities make all major and meaningful decisions. The central government ideally would only directly control the armed forces and the educational system, having few other delegated powers. Pioism is by nature incredibly hostile to both Socialism and Nationalism, believing both play equal parts in the Devil’s efforts to prevent people from entering Heaven. As a result, Pioism seeks the destruction of nationhood itself, mostly by the replacement of national myth with an embracing of the Catholic faith. Along with this, Pioism demands the creation of a powerful welfare state, ensuring that all citizens have nothing to trouble them, so that all their energies can be focused on reaching the Beatific Vision. For non-Catholics, Pioism, while not directly hostile to their existence, still treating them as God’s children thus granting them the same access to social services, does not allow them to worship in public. It does not forbid them from worshiping in private, but being a non-Catholic in a Pioist government comes with a certain level of detachment from the rest of society. In short, Pioism seeks to usher in a new era of Catholicism, one where every human person has the ability to reach Heaven, even if it costs everything else. "

Often highly decentralized aside the sole paternalistic authority (or authorities) keeping the whole system together, these states are often a strange mix of anti-statism and autocracy as individuals and merc squads are free to largely do as they please so long as they obey the orders of the Big Boss or whatever other forces dominate the system.

Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Reformist Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic piety, Social Catholicism or non-Revolutionary Socialist Welfare, Belgian Unitarianism, and the cultivation of a uniquely Belgian culture and identity, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently tied to any one political group, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, from the Reformed and Humanitarian Rexists of Hergé to the Humanist Capitalists of Buisseret and the Socialist Belgicists of Dehousse."

Furthermore, the ideology preaches that the British throne is the direct continuation of the Davidic throne of Israel and that the British Royal Family are the direct blood descendants of King David of Judah, that the Stone of Scone used in British coronations is the pillow stone of the bible that Jacob slept on and was later used in David’s coronation, that Britain and the United States are the inheritor’s of Jacob’s birthright through the Tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, and that most modern Israelites spread across the world like the Britons are not Jews.

Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

monopolized_anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Monopolized Anarchism)§!\n\nMonopolized Anarchism, also sometimes called Corporate Anarchism, is a near-paradoxical thoughtform that seeks to evolve the ideas of Libertarianism, Corporatocracy, Minarchism, and Anarcho-Capitalism in order to better benefit business owners and corporate titans while protecting the newly-freed public. Pushing for a dissolution of the State and all it entails, Monopolized Anarchism replaces this archaic and tyrannical system of oppression with a free, Right-Libertarian society where the non-aggression principle and other necessary aspects of society are protected and provided by the large corporations, firms, and businesses that tore down the old system. Aside from ensuring that the NAP is protected and that the rights and liberties of the masses are enshrined, the corporations go about their business as the economic lifeblood of the society, while also functioning as a ‘State’ in regards to international diplomacy and command of the military, though publically organized militias are still common so long as they do not infringed upon the NAP. Treading the line between Right Anarchism and Corporate tyranny, Monopolized Anarchism is a strange ideology pushed by strange theorists, and is largely the brainchild of American captain of industry Irénée du Pont, and as such it has become common for his more reactionary ideas to seep into the ideology as well."

This strange ideology has evolved overtime, now reappearing in lands seemingly too civilized for this archaic way of life, and yet it still persists. In the case of places like Fiume, the Dual Cities were pushed to the brink, resorting to piracy in a bid to keep themselves afloat, both literally and financially. Due to its bellicose nature, Pirate Republicanism is usually incredibly strict and very loyalty-based, only promoting those of the highest merit with little regard to birth. Direct Democracy is used on board ships and within the army, but there are no elections to elect the Dual Governor or the city council in the case of Fiume, or the governments of other similar regimes. Pirate Republics are only usually willing to work with those they believe can be trusted or those that can help lessen the pirate plight. This strange ideology is uncompromising in the face of pursuing its unique goals and places heavy emphasis on cooperation and the wise management of funding, as well as within the idea of developing a "cult of personality" around the executive, being the Dual Governor, or Grand Admiral in Fiume’s case - the main progenitor of this weird ideology."

Ranging from true chiefdoms and native kingdoms to tribal council democracies and decentralized groupings of communes and villages, these varied societies are not Socialist or Progressive in the slightest due to such terms being rooted in a Western point of experience and mindset or in theories entirely foreign to the groups in question. These societies still exhibit similar practices and ideas such as communalism, egalitarianism, non-traditional gender roles and identities, forms of welfare or social security, economic systems based around reciprocity and even minor distributism, and much more.

noirism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Noirisme)§!\n\nNoirisme, or Noirism, is a uniquely Haitian ideology common across the Haitian ideological spectrum that calls for Afro-Haitian dominance over the White and Mulatto elites after centuries of oppression. Inspired by and linked to the Negritude movement of French Africa and the French Caribbean, but far more Haitian-centric, Noirisme posits that American and French colonialism, along with the long-standing dominance of the Mulatto ruling class over the massive Kreyol and Afro-Haitian majority, have long been the detriment of Haitian society, and that only through an Afrocentric cultural renaissance can Haiti escape the shackles of Eurocentric stagnation and Kreyol cultural degradation. Championed by varied political and cultural minds across Haiti’s ideological spectrum, ranging from the Right-wing nationalists of Carl Brouard to the moderate democrats of Jean Price-Mars, and even reaching towards the Left with the Syndicalists of Jacques Roumain and Joseph Jolibois, the specific socioeconomic policies backing the thoughtform may differ greatly, but all are dedicated to the upliftment of the Afro-Haitian majority and the revival of their Kreyol and Vodou-based culture."

ethereal_noirism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Noirisme Éthéré)§!\n\nNoirisme Éthéré, or Ethereal Noirism, is the unofficial term used to label the strange and ill-defined ideology of François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier. Noirisme itself forms the foundation of the ideology, as championed by Duvalier’s mentor and predecessor Carl Brouard as well as other Afro-Haitian leaders across the political spectrum like Jean Price-Mars, Jacques Roumain, and Émile Roumer, which calls for Afro-Haitian nationalism and cultural renewal in order to resist the effects and harsh realities of American colonialism, oppression at the hands of the White and Mulatto elites, and the overwhelming political dominance of Haiti’s Left, while replacing their Eurocentric ideas with facets of African, Kreyol, and Vodou beliefs and motifs in order to create a society form-fit for the Afro-Haitian majority. However, where Duvalier’s interpretation of Noirisme differs is in his radical implementation of the ideology along with his wide-ranging tweaks made to it in order to fit his own needs and designs for Haiti. Seeking to create his own patriarchal and totalitarian Duvalier Dynasty that would rule over Haiti as a hereditary, semi-regal dictatorship festooned with West African and Vodou spiritual and cultural symbolisms, Papa Doc reinforces this dream with his own violent paramilitary the Tonton Makout - the Bogeymen of Haiti - who use mysticism and myth to hide their identities as they act as the dark specters of our nation while uplifting himself as the avatar of Baron Samedi - the Haitian Lwa, or God, of Death, leading a Vodou and Kreyol revival by force in order to fully replace ‘White’ religion that has long polluted the minds and souls of the Haitian masses, taking it so far as to use Haitian spiritual healing, black magic, and other practices to cleanse more and more facets of daily life of the European taint. With this spiritual nationalism being paired with brutal authoritarianism, a kleptocratic fusion of corporatism and corrupt capitalism, an immense cult of personality steeped in Vodou mysticism and occultism that holds Papa Doc as the embodiment of the state itself as well as the personification of the Vodou faith, staunch militarism and paramilitarism aimed at complete control of the public and narrative, and a dedication to Afro-Haitian exceptionalism and the wider Pan-African dream, Noirisme Éthéré may be ill-defined, but that matters not to Papa Doc has he holds Haiti in the palm of Baron Samedi’s hands."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

Largely championed by the Sicilian Left with its various socialists, social democrats, syndicalists, and communists like the revolutionary Antonio Canepa and the social-democrat minister Giovanni Guarino - though also growing increasingly common along the Sicilian Right among the local aristocracy around figures like Baron Lucio Tasca and Duke Guglielmo Paternò, along with their traditionalist allies among the Christian democrats, conservative agrarians, and even the Mafia as Cosa Nostra and the small right-wing of the Movement for the Independence of Sicily continue to grow closer, as well as within even more chaotic and less ideological circles like the Robin Hood-esque brigantaggio group of Salvatore ‘Turiddu’ Giuliano - Sicilianism is not too concerned with the socio-economic specifics until their dream of an empowered Sicily has been fulfilled, for that is a debate that can come later, but most across the spectrum support some kind of populism and pro-working class policies due to the poor, rough, and rural reality Sicilians have lived for centuries. Divided on what to do with with the Mafia and other sources of corrupt elitism deeply ingrained in our age-old traditions, but fully determined to see their republican dream realized, Sicilianists rise like the new Vespers of old to throw off the foreign shackles that have oppressed Sicilia for far too long, once and for all."

Contemporary Yugoslavism is largely split between two dominant subtypes, being the integrationists who favored integral Yugoslavism while promoting unitarism, centralization, and the rapid total unification of the South Slavic ethnic and linguistic groups into a single Yugoslav nation, even by coercion if necessary, and the federalists which advocated for the autonomy of each slice of historic South Slavic lands in the form of a diverse federation that would slowly work towards total unification at a gradual pace, and without outside pressure. However, despite their differences, both subsects agree on the concept of National Oneness developed as an expression of the strategic alliance of South Slavs in Austria-Hungary, and as a reaction to the rise of Germanization, Trialism, and Magyarization running rampant throughout the empire hellbent on either snuffing out the South Slavs or subjugating use to Vienna for good, thus giving credence to the concept that the South Slavs belong to a single ‘race’, are of ‘one blood’, and hold a shared language. Divided on matters of economics or governance, with monarchist, republican, reactionary, and socialist variants all being on the rise, it is this oneness of race, tongue, culture, and history that should be focused on first instead, so that the idea of South Slavic unity can be uplifted, united, and supported to create a prosperous future for our related peoples."

Emerging from the formerly Florence-based futurist group headed by Papini, Ardengo Soffici, Aldo Palazzeschi, and Italo Tavolato which came into direct conflict with the formerly Milan-based Marinettist futurists, Right Futurism has been deeply influenced by the Post-Decadentism movement, which promoted an aesthetic existence of excess and artificiality, alongside many others across the Italian political and cultural spectrum that mirror its creator’s own hectic, contradictory, and paradoxical journey through Italy’s upper crust. Borrowing at different times of his life from Catholic Social Teachings, Anti-Clericalism, Atheism, Individualism, Conservatism, Corporatism, Interventionism, Symbolism, Bergsonite Intuitionism, and Anglo-American Pragmatism to name but a few, Papini’s thought is no doubt highly syncretic, but still hinges on the core principle of rejecting and releasing all connections with the past in order to embrace a perfected concept of an idealized and aesthetically-perfect future outlined by Marinetti’s Manifesto del Futurismo. That does not mean Papinists are entirely aligned with the Left side of their movement when it comes to the way society should be engineered, for the major difference and the reason for the original split was the Florentine group's rejection of what they saw as Milan's 'immobile church with an infallible creed'. Existing as a distinct wing within the wider Republican side of the ANI, Right Futurists are the Italian Right’s controversial ticket to the prosperous horizon promised by the original concept of the Manifesto, albeit through a strange and highly chaotic vessel."

italian_legionarism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Italian Legionarism)§!\n\nItalian Legionarism is the guiding ideology, although quite ambiguous both in principles and application, of the Italian Nationalist Association, known as Associazione Nazionalista Italiana in the language of Dante. Originating as Italy's first properly organized nationalist movement, galvanized by various existing irredentist ideas and organizations like the Trento and Trieste Society, the ANI gathered a myriad of patriots with diverse backgrounds, both social and political. From nobles and bourgeois to even lower classes, be they ardent monarchists, radical democrats or revolutionaries in the national sense. The unifying principle was support for Italy's colonial-imperial and irredentist ambitions combined with a struggle against the 'ignoble socialism', sullying the national spirit by their pacifism. This has, to some extent, changed with the disastrous Weltkrieg, Italian Civil War but also the brilliant example of Gabrielle D'Annunzio's Fiume Endeavor, organized in the confusing times between the definite end points of the great conflict. After the great poet's martyrdom the remaining Legionaries and Arditi, combined with rightist nationalists and monarchists rallied around the founders of the ANI. Those being, among many others, Enrico Corradini - the creator of the 'Proletarian Nations' concept, describing places like Italy where the spirit of the common people is in direct opposition to the oppresive 'plutocratic' world states, Ezio Maria Gray - proponent of a united Mediterranean project led by the renowned Italian State, Giovanni Papini - the chief of the Right Futurists after the definite split with Marinettists, Alfredo Rocco - the progenitor of the economic model known as 'Corporatism', and various monarchists led by Constanzo and Galeazzo Ciano alongside Luigi Federzoni and recent convert Dino Grandi. The last decades made ANI, while still a party-movement with clearly visible factions, a more unified front for all of the Italian Nationalists yearning to restore the greatness to their Patria, although some members have decided to struck out on their own such as the Ultracatholic 'White Flames' under father Reginaldo Giuliani in the Papal State or the duo of Giovanni Giuriati and Giovanni Host-Venturi, still active in the now-calmer Fiume, perhaps wishing to implement the Charter of Carnaro once again, a document which some in the main ANI have forgotten about."

Arguing that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays in order to ensure absolute economic security for its populace. Called pseudo-Socialism by its detractors on the Right and predatory economics bent on tricking the proletariat by its detractors on the Left, Social Credit Theory is frequently tied to ideas of Christian Distributism, Economic Syncretism, Agrarianism, and other ideas of the Christian Right, even including Radical Environmentalism when including the Kibbo Kift, and proposes a third path in order to create a safe and secure economic utopia for all within the system."

Such development may be induced by the government's increased radicalization or takeover by ultranationalist and far-right ideologues, ones which necessairly have to rely on a strong state apparatus to keep internal peace and secure the borders. National Security States are a final evolution of such processes, state-bound entities in which power has been relegated almost entirely to fanatical security agencies, or nations in which the chiefs-in-charge have decreed that the previous government is no longer able to maintain the national values and order. While the vast majority of the leaders of such states are generally concerned with establishing a 'Republic of the Strongmen', borrowing the Russian term 'Siloviki', some do genuinely believe in the gospel of the parties which had allowed their rise to power. That does not mean, of course, that an 'NSS' shall never break with any tenet previously established, for their main consideration is always how a policy shall ensure the continued national stability and prosperity for their group. Thus, these 'agencies with a state' pursue any and all means necessary to eliminate both internal and external threats which could jeopardize their ambitious mission of creating an ever-watchful nation-state, founded on the principles borrowed from many a rightist movement."
