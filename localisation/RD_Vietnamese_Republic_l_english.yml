vnqdd.0.desc:0 "Huzzah! We have crushed the reactionary and syndicalist traitors! Watch them scatter into the jungles. We shall proclaim our victory from Hanoi! We are full of jubilation as we celebrate a new era of prosperity for Vietnam. As the drums of victory still rage on, we now are at the crossroads of our political and economic future. May Vietnam, Live Long & Prosper!"
vnqdd.1.desc:0 "The time has come comrades, to put forward the question of our national future. As per this we shall demonstrate the first party congress and decide on who shall lead us for decades to come. The first candidate is the radical socialist, Nguyen Tuong Tam who advocates for the Vietnamese Republic to follow economic and political paths similar to Wang Jingwei of the Kuomintang in China. Despite being socialist, Tuong is not pro syndicalist and has stated that Vietnam shall be socialist but not dictatorial like the Indochinese Union. Next is the main leader of our revolution,  Nguyen Thai Hoc, who helped found the VNQDD and has been inspired to follow the Minquan faction of the Kuomintang and also follow a more state capitalist line of economic practice. Next is  the military faction, led by Nguyen Hai Thanh. Hia Thanh has been more inclined to follow the examples of the rightwing Kuomintang and support ideas espoused by the now dead Chiang Kai Shek. His faction favors a more pragmatic economics instead of the socialist ones promoted by Thai Hoc and Tuong Tam. Finally is the most radical faction led by Truong Tu Anh, who is a highly nationalist figure within the party. He promotes ideas that are in close relation to social darwinism and also promotes pragmatic economic practices as a part of his ideology of ‘Survival Nationalism’."
vnqdd.2.desc:0 "Now a significant amount of time has passed in which now we can decide on the further development of our political future. The decision of political tutelage plays around the minds of Hai Thanh and the military council (Which he formed after he took power), on whether to allow for open elections or to continue tutelage. With each having concerns on stability and military power."
vnqdd.3.desc:0 "In this current time, Tuong Tam faces a dilemma on how to deal with ever so interrupting political dissent. Surely if he allows democracy, the country will fall back into the hands of his syndicalist and reactionary enemies. After a few days of pacing, Tuong Tam meets with the head of the National Bureau of Intelligence & Statistics to organize a coup. As the coup starts Tuong Tam faces second thoughts and now has to make a decision on whether to crack down on the coup or continue with his original plan."
vnqdd.4.desc:0 "In 1934, he went to Hanoi to study Law at Indochina University . As a person with a national spirit, during his studies, he paid much attention to studying the philosophies and political theories that were prevalent in the world at that time. In essays written since 1935, he once wrote: ‘The contemporary philosophies and political theories are not suitable for the Vietnamese people and are all wrong.’ As of today Tu Anh has published his theory of ‘Survival Nationalism’. This ideology is inspired by eugenics theory and can be summarized into 3 main points.\n\n\n-Humans are composed of basic instincts of selfishness , sexuality , and society.\n\n-To survive, these instincts must be stronger than other individuals.\n\n-To be strong instincts need strength, transformation and integration."
