JAPKOZA_strike_down_capitalism_desc:0 "What has the introduction of capitalism to Japan done? It has created a mass of people who work all day in terrible conditions. These people hardly own anything to call their own and have no recourse if their employment is ended. This miserable mass of people has grown all over Japan as this system has expanded. What will these people do once they have had enough of their unjust treatment? Violence where there need not have been any. The destruction of any chance of a harmonious peaceful society. That is why capitalism must be opposed."

JAPKOZA_radical_land_reforms_desc:0 "The old governments left the rural villages to rot as they chased deluded dreams of wealth. When we took power, the villages were in disarray as the old governments had let economic globalization take over Japan without a single care about its effects on the politically marginalized peasants. The urban population has grown at the expence of the rural population as many rural youth seek to escape a dying way of life to the cities. We shall assure the rural population that our government is listening to their cries by implementing policies that improve rural life."

JAPKOZA_purge_the_old_order_desc:0 "Though Tachibana has secured the reins of power for now, such control is not secure. There are still many influential people in positions of power whose beliefs and personal interests go against our government. For our rule to be secure, these corrupt buffoons who would have led Japan to ruin must not be allowed to thrive and act against us."

As the people of Japan read and understand these texts, they will learn the importance of living righteously with love for their fellow humans."

JAPKOZA_forming_the_imperial_brotherhood_desc:0 "One of the first acts of our government shall be the creation of the Imperial Brotherhood. This organization shall act as the link between our government and the people of Japan. Any individuals loyal to Japan and the emperor will be welcome to join in order to work for the betterment of Japan."
JAPKOZA_ending_the_monsters_of_globalization:0 "Ending the Monsters of Globalization"
JAPKOZA_ending_the_monsters_of_globalization_desc:0 "It was in 1853 that the Perry expedition first forced Japan to open diplomatic and trade relations with the west. It was such an action that created the next governments of Japan. Desiring to follow the way of the west and its cheap commodities, the government of Japan opened itself up and acted to adopt whatever it could to become more similar. This Japan created in the image of the west, is thus subservient to it and cannot continue existing."
JAPKOZA_tachibanasascension:0 "Tachibana's Ascension"
JAPKOZA_tachibanasascension_desc:0 "Who could have expected the current state of affairs in Japan? Nobody. Yet when push came to shove, the deep antipathy the Japanese people felt for the status quo led to Tachibana's victory. Now it is Tachibana's turn to fufill his duty and answer the desires of the Japanese people for freedom."
