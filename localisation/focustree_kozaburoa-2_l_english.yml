JAPKOZA_strike_down_capitalism_desc:0 "What has the introduction of capitalism to Japan done? It has created a mass of people who work all day in terrible conditions. These people hardly own anything to call their own and have no recourse if their employment is ended. This miserable mass of people has grown all over Japan as this system has expanded. What will these people do once they have had enough of their unjust treatment? Violence where there need not have been any. The destruction of any chance of a harmonious peaceful society. That is why capitalism must be opposed."

JAPKOZA_ending_the_monsters_of_globalization_desc:0 "It was in 1853 that the Perry expedition first forced Japan to open diplomatic and trade relations with the west. It was such an action that created the next governments of Japan. Desiring to follow the way of the west and its cheap commodities, the government of Japan opened itself up and acted to adopt whatever it could to become more similar. This Japan created in the image of the west, is thus subservient to it and cannot continue existing."

Yet when push came to shove, the deep antipathy the Japanese people felt for the status quo led to Tachibana's victory. Now it is Tachibana's turn to fufill his duty and answer the desires of the Japanese people for freedom."
