JAPKOZA_cleansing_of_national_politics_desc:0 "Now that our control over the government is more secure, it is now possible to remove all the enemies of the people of Japan from power. Their previous actions were not for the people of Japan but rather for the greedy gang of corrupt industrialists that swept away any opposition to their rule. We will remove these proxies of those industrialists for politicians that are truly dedicated to the people."

JAPKOZA_local_village_reliance_desc:0 "The villages have existed for far longer than any human currently alive and despite the attacks on them by the old governments, will continue existing far into the future. Are they not beautiful? Communities where people live out their daily life knowing that they can trust their neighbors. We shall enact decentralization efforts to give more power to local governments for they are more knowledgeable of the particulars of the local situation. This will improve our government's popularity amongst the people."
JAPKOZA_strike_down_capitalism:0 "Strike Down Capitalism"
JAPKOZA_strike_down_capitalism_desc:0 "What has the introduction of capitalism to Japan done? It has created a mass of people who work all day in terrible conditions. These people hardly own anything to call their own and have no recourse if their employment is ended. This miserable mass of people has grown all over Japan as this system has expanded. What will these people do once they have had enough of their unjust treatment? Violence where there need not have been any. The destruction of any chance of a harmonious peaceful society. That is why capitalism must be opposed."
JAPKOZA_removal_of_the_zaibatsu:0 "Removal of the Zaibatsu"
JAPKOZA_removal_of_the_zaibatsu_desc:0 "Now that we control the majoritiy of the largest zaibatsus, it is time to break them up and give them to the people. Rather than the greedy mass of industry that destroyed any and all obstacles in its path of expansion and profit, we shall create oppertunities for small businesses and co-ops that create their goods out of a genuine desire for their livelihood. The people of Japan will be free from the controlling tendrils of the zaibatsu as they earn the fruits of their labor."
JAPKOZA_industrial_transformation:0 "Industrial Transformation"
JAPKOZA_industrial_transformation_desc:0 "The greed of the old governments let industry grow at an unprecendented rate while the people who would have to experience the negative effects of such growth were ignored. The owners of industry gladly cooperated in this corrupt scheme for personal wealth at the expense of Japan. Thus, we must first remove these individuals from their positions of power by removing their ownership of their industry if we are to free Japan."
JAPKOZA_radical_land_reforms:0 "Refocusing on the Peasant"
JAPKOZA_radical_land_reforms_desc:0 "The old governments left the rural villages to rot as they chased deluded dreams of wealth. When we took power, the villages were in disarray as the old governments had let economic globalization take over Japan without a single care about its effects on the politically marginalized peasants. The urban population has grown at the expence of the rural population as many rural youth seek to escape a dying way of life to the cities. We shall assure the rural population that our government is listening to their cries by implementing policies that improve rural life."
JAPKOZA_purge_the_old_order:0 "Purge the Old Order"
JAPKOZA_purge_the_old_order_desc:0 "Though Tachibana has secured the reins of power for now, such control is not secure. There are still many influential people in positions of power whose beliefs and personal interests go against our government. For our rule to be secure, these corrupt buffoons who would have led Japan to ruin must not be allowed to thrive and act against us."
JAPKOZA_work_with_bin_akao:0 "Legacy of the Writers"
JAPKOZA_work_with_bin_akao_desc:0 "With Tachibana's thoughts being inspired by the writings of many famous humanist authors like Ghandi and Tolstoy, these works will be produced for all of Japan to read and learn from. As the people of Japan read and understand these texts, they will learn the importance of living righteously with love for their fellow humans."
JAPKOZA_forming_the_imperial_brotherhood:0 "Forming the Imperial Brotherhood"
JAPKOZA_forming_the_imperial_brotherhood_desc:0 "One of the first acts of our government shall be the creation of the Imperial Brotherhood. This organization shall act as the link between our government and the people of Japan. Any individuals loyal to Japan and the emperor will be welcome to join in order to work for the betterment of Japan."
JAPKOZA_ending_the_monsters_of_globalization:0 "Ending the Monsters of Globalization"
JAPKOZA_ending_the_monsters_of_globalization_desc:0 "It was in 1853 that the Perry expedition first forced Japan to open diplomatic and trade relations with the west. It was such an action that created the next governments of Japan. Desiring to follow the way of the west and its cheap commodities, the government of Japan opened itself up and acted to adopt whatever it could to become more similar. This Japan created in the image of the west, is thus subservient to it and cannot continue existing."
JAPKOZA_tachibanasascension:0 "Tachibana's Ascension"
JAPKOZA_tachibanasascension_desc:0 "Who could have expected the current state of affairs in Japan? Nobody. Yet when push came to shove, the deep antipathy the Japanese people felt for the status quo led to Tachibana's victory. Now it is Tachibana's turn to fufill his duty and answer the desires of the Japanese people for freedom."
