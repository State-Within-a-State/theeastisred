AOG_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Seeing Germany's need for a jet-powered intercontinental bomber, Arado Aviationworks set out to develop an upscaled version of their experimental jet tactical bomber, the Ar 234. The Ar 576 feautres a unique engine design whereby all four jet engines are inlaid in the wing of the aircraft; it was the jarring sound these engines make when spinning up, a sound like that of a hammer being slammed against the fuselage, that the Ar 576 earned the nickname 'hammer' among German test pilots."
