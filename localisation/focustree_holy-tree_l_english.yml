SIA_the_seizure_of_khemmarat:0 "The Seizure of Khemmarat"
SIA_the_seizure_of_khemmarat_desc:0 "The lush banks of the Mekong have harbored countless peoples before our own, and in ages past it has served as a refuge for many an exiled king. So too it is with our own movement, driven out of French Laos by brutal oppression. Yet the Muang of Khemmarat offers a chance to begin anew, and to bring a new age for our movement. We cannot afford to waste it. \n As we consolidate control over our province, we shall begin looking for the purest of the pure amongst the Thai and Lao population. They will be the footsoldiers of our Holy Ones' light, a light that shall pierce through all the land - and wipe away the forces of darkness that oppose them. "
SIA_a_choice_of_strategy:0 "A Choice of Strategy"
SIA_a_choice_of_strategy_desc:0 "The Buddha pondered his path beneath a bodhi tree, and the liberation of countless millions from their suffering would come from his choices. Our struggles offer us a repose of our own, a window of time to determine who we should work with to maximize the chances of success. There are three broad avenues that offer a realistic path to bring our movement to victory. \n We could pursue connections with the Sangha of the Thai and Laotian communities, for the monkhood has come into increasing conflict with both the Thai monarchy and the French puppet regimes, and many sympathizers have sought concord with us in private. On the other hand, we could also pursue our own path to monarchy. It is what the people know best, and there are many signs that a king would be welcomed by foreign powers in the region. Finally, we could fully cloak ourselves in the mantle of Liberation - and make something entirely new from the clay of our common folk."
SIA_lean_to_the_sangha:0 "Lean to the Sangha"
SIA_lean_to_the_sangha_desc:0 "We will explore our options with the Sangha, whose influence rivals our own in these areas - the Monkhood and the temples offer us new avenues to influence the young and impressionable, and the many monks disillusioned with French and Thai imposition will surely lend us their support. Bring out the carpets and sacred umbrellas - we will usher in a new age of pure Buddhism for the people, and bring about an age of Karmic justice unseen since the Sutras were written!"
SIA_lean_to_the_crown:0 "Lean to the Crown"
SIA_lean_to_the_crown_desc:0 "The kings of Thai and Lao descent have long reigned over our territory, and although their senior officials have fled the structures still remain. We can use this to our advantage, rehiring royal officials to serve our cause - and perhaps we could explore the opportunities to build a new and better kingly dynasty in our area, destroying the falsehoods and the oppressions of our predecessors, too. "
SIA_lean_into_the_people:0 "Lean into the People"
SIA_lean_into_the_people_desc:0 "Upon whose authority was the Rebellion founded? It was the Common Folk who give power to the Holy Men! It is the mantle of divine guidance that the noble peasant bestows upon our leadership, and we shall promise in turn the restoration of all that was lost to them - we shall destroy the temples that usurp so much of the land, we shall break down the kings that tell us what to do as they seize our rice and our people, we shall turn this world truly equal! Let the oppressors be warned, for our banners of equality brook no opposition and take no prisoners - and we will build a new world atop their ashes."
SIA_tear_down_the_infidel:0 "Tear Down the Infidel"
SIA_tear_down_the_infidel_desc:0 "Our first target shall be those who have dared stray from the Buddha's sacred teachings - these monsters are threats to our world and political rivals to our allies. The Westerners and the secularized elites of our territories will be rooted out and made an example of, for purity shall brook no intrusion. In their next lives, they will thank us for showing us the true path, and we shall thank them in turn for giving us the opportunity to wipe our state clean of its pollutants."
SIA_destroy_the_pretenders:0 "Destroy the Pretenders"
SIA_destroy_the_pretenders_desc:0 "We must stay true to our roots - we were borne from the persecution and destruction of our tribes, and so we must break down the petty kings and generals who claim power over our roots. We shall target those who have dared raise their fists against us by the order of the false Dynasty in Krung Thep, and we shall call upon our local supporters to level the playing field by finding royal prophecies that elevate us to the true title of King of the Laotians and Thais!"
