BBR_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Republican Army"
BBR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "The Republican Army - A grouping of Army Officials with more traditional American Ideals, the Republican Army is led by Charles Young and supported by a mixture of black officers, the middle-class and many whites still in the region who are not ODP members. They are more sympathetic to an American identity which they believe can unite whites and blacks as well as Rooseveltian policies, believing that Woodrow Wilson subverted the progressive Republicans attempts to improve the economy or create racial egalitarianism.

BBR_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Nation of Islam - The Nation of Islam is a radical black supremacist group best known for following a racialist and highly heretical variant of Islam that claims the "White Race" was created by a mad scientist named Yakub thousands of years ago and that the "Black Race" is the chosen people of Allah. Their leader Elijah Muhammad claims that NOI founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was God himself and that Elijah Muhammad is his appointed prophet on Earth, with Fard's sudden dissaparence leaving Elijah in charge. Outside the NOI Fard's dissaparence is a source of a multitude of conspiracy theories but nonetheless the NOI's paramilitary prowess, appeals to racial purity, guarantees of a minimum standard of living for members and promise to end all threats to Black Americans has made it one of the most powerful, and extreme, far-right organizations in Black America."

### Ideas ###
BBR_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis, the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

BBR_black_monday:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

BBR_black_monday2:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_black_monday2_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

BBR_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
BBR_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea2:0 "Slight Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea2_desc:0 "While we may have stopped the cholera epidemics and famines, most of the country is still on fire. The only place one can find any modicum of stability is the heavily guarded military depots containing newly-delivered famine relief aid and medicine."

BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea4:0 "Advancing Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea5:0 "Nearly-Full Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country.

### NazBol Gang ###
BBR_abb:0 "The African Blood Brotherhood"
BBR_abb_desc:0 "The National Syndicalists of the ABB have managed to seize power from within the Unity League! This will be a century for both the black race and proletariat, as syndicalism shall be an expression of racial nationalism. The old capitalist class that once held us back will be crushed."
BBR_the_crusaders:0 "The Crusaders"
BBR_the_crusaders_desc:0 "The Crusader has been the newsletter of the ABB since its founding, and with the ABB's dominance, it will need loyalists to carry out its will. The Crusaders shall be made up of the most devoted of the ABB's paramilitary and the Crusader itself will be more widely distributed with tales of their benevolence."
BBR_racial_expropriation:0 "Racial Expropriation"
BBR_racial_expropriation_desc:0 "While we can work with other national proletariat groups, it is clear that within its own land, the Black population needs to own the wealth that had been taken from them. It was stolen by the foriegn capitalist class, which has repressed Black labor within the nation. As such, non-Black members of the upper-middle and upper-classes will have their wealth repossesed by the state, which represents the Black Proletariat."
BBR_hamitic_league_of_the_world:0 "Hamitic League of the World"
BBR_hamitic_league_of_the_world_desc:0 "The Hamitic League of the World is aware of a very simple fact: the Negro race is the greatest race the world has ever known. Further, Black civilization is far older than Whites have claimed. Its membership numbers must be expanded among both Black and mixed-race peoples. It needs funding to promote its views among the populace and overseas to promote our legitimacy, with the League becoming a predominant means of outreach to the black community both here and abroad."
BBR_children_of_the_sun:0 "The Children of the Sun"
BBR_children_of_the_sun_desc:0 "We are the descendents of great civilzations including Egypt, Greece, and Ethiopia, and yet this knowledge is supressed by the White Bourgeosie and their collaborators at every turn. It is time to expand schools and colleges with these new teachings and to spread the word throughout the ABB of our ancient origins, so that unity and pride amongst our people will be absolute."
BBR_the_black_pharoah:0 "The Black Pharaoh"
BBR_the_black_pharoah_desc:0 "We have established a proper state, founded around defending our ancient heritage and subduing the capitalist class. The title of a Black Pharoah shall be given to Duse Mohamad to solidify his status as the sole executive authority of the Black proletariat and their history. At Cyril Briggs' urging, the title shall be passed through party members devoted to the cause and as such, marks the first National Republican Pharaohdom."
BBR_national_syndicalism:0 "Black National Syndicalism"
BBR_national_syndicalism_desc:0 "We must ensure the economy is organized in such a way as to represent not just the workers, but our people's very spirit. We shall establish loyal unions and guilds representing either workers or professions whose efforts are protected and directed by the loyal, professional Black producerist class."
BBR_work_communes:0 "Work Communes"
BBR_work_communes_desc:0 "A means of organizing more unskilled and still unorganized members of the Black Nation so they may contribute to society and secure for themselves employment is challenging. It is certainly not impossible. An administrative, government-established union will be put to use overseeing work projects we desperately need done. It will use either the unemployed or those in less productive sectors of the economy who could be shifted elsewhere."
BBR_black_mercantilism:0 "Black Mercantilism"
BBR_black_mercantilism_desc:0 "Due to the oppression of the Children of the Sun, we have been unable to build wealth in the same manner as others, but having our own mercantilism will solve this. The former merchants of our nation will be organized to work on behalf of the people under state-run corporations."
BBR_state_quotas:0 "State Quotas"
BBR_state_quotas_desc:0 "As our state is reluctant to use wages to motivate the people, nationalist and socialist goals have served to do the job. Sometimes this is not enough however, so we will set state quotas on bureaucrats in industry and agriculture to ensure maximum production."
BBR_black_nobility:0 "Black Nobility"
BBR_black_nobility_desc:0 "In taking back our rightful place, we must look to the past for inspiratation. A black nobility once existed that created much of civilization before its legacy was covered up. We will recreate the Black Nobility with titles to loyal party officials and the exceptional. This will inspire the socialist upper-class and bound them to our nation while making them responsible for certain localities."

### Totalists ###

BBR_the_vanguard_desc:0 "The Vanguard Socialists have won the election and are now in a position to organize a radically progressive, collectivist society under the guidance of a strong leader."
BBR_red_army:0 "Top-Down Revolutionary Army"
BBR_red_army_desc:0 "The militias were effective for an initial uprising, but to continue to face professional armies, we will need one of our own. It will need discipline and to be answerable to the state alone. As such, the militias will be organized into a true military, without reactionary influence."
BBR_league_of_revolutionary_struggle:0 "The League of Revolutionary Struggle"
BBR_league_of_revolutionary_struggle_desc:0 "While our military is organized, we still need intelligence services and propaganda. The League of Revolutionary Struggle will be made into government agency in charge of both, gaining our support among the populace and training internal agents to investigate treachery."
BBR_military_build_up:0 "Building Our Own Arms"
BBR_military_build_up_desc:0 "The naive would have us focus solely on civilian investments, but military industries are no less important. In fact, they are more-so, as we require them to defend the nation. Our planned economy is superior in building such goods and industries, as we will set aside areas to be developed into military factories."
BBR_rapid_nationalization:0 "Rapid Nationalization"
BBR_rapid_nationalization_desc:0 "The economy must come under the command of the government at once if we are to develop true socialism. As such, major industries will be nationalized and brought under the control of the government, capitalists be damned."
BBR_expand_the_party:0 "Expanding the Party"
BBR_expand_the_party_desc:0 "We will pour more energy into gaining recruits among the population and require left-leaning trade unions to become party members at once, for the party represents the worker."

BBR_black_trade_unity_league_desc:0 "The Collectivist-Syndicalists under Harry Haywood and his Haywood-Fosterite followers have come to dominance, and thus our Republic will know true radicalism and, in the process, true liberation."
BBR_hammer_and_hoe:0 "The Hammer and the Hoe"
BBR_hammer_and_hoe_desc:0 "The economy must come under the absolute control of the TUUL, with each TUUL region being responsible for collectivizing the industrial and agricultural sectors at once while undoing bourgousie influence such as abolishing monetary wages in favor of supply provisions."
BBR_agrarian_revolution:0 "The Agrarian Revolution"
BBR_agrarian_revolution_desc:0 "Agriculture must be advanced at once. Collectivization must be intensified, capital goods for farms acquired and built, quotas set, and research funded into Agricultural advancements. Due to their resistance, former landlords will be liquidated."
BBR_marxian_nationalism:0 "Marxian Nationalism"
BBR_marxian_nationalism_desc:0 "Most forms of 'Nationalism' are sadly reactionary, but it need not stay that way. Local cultural nationalisms can be respected as a tool of liberation, so long as class solidarity comes first, so administrations for different regions will be established."
BBR_total_liberation:0 "Total Liberation"
BBR_total_liberation_desc:0 "We've taken the reigns of the economy, but that does not mean the culture has changed enough. Let us destroy the remnants of imperialism and reaction in a nationwide campaign to create a truly socialist culture in which class struggle and revolutionary action is the prime mover and remaining reactionaries in society are stopped from spreading their poison."
BBR_anti_imperialism:0 "Radical Anti-Imperialism"
BBR_anti_imperialism_desc:0 "We must confront the imperialist powers that have placed a target on our back and have subjugated much of the world under capitalism. Army recruitment, martial preparedness, anti-imperialist education, the liquidation of remaining imperialists, and aggressive training are all of grave necessity."
BBR_black_communist_league:0 "New Communist League"
BBR_black_communist_league_desc:0 "The New Communist League of Ben Davis has come to power and seeks to build socialism in America under a single central party, which they call 'Black Jacobinism' after the French model. Their biggest hope is that they may help advance world socialism."
BBR_rapid_industrialization:0 "Industrializing the Land"
BBR_rapid_industrialization_desc:0 "We must put industrialization of the nation first if we are to be a leading socialist economy. We should export our raw resources in return for capital goods from the Internationale, and have our planners place emphasis on producing new factories and nationalizing older ones for a true economy of scale."
BBR_left_military_police:0 "Jacobin Military Police"
BBR_left_military_police_desc:0 "Our military should be praised for the work it has done so far, but that does not mean reactionary influence is not present. A Jacobin Military Police will be geared towards monitoring for potential disloyalty within, and sometimes outside, the military. Further, they will handle military trials, increasing discipline and stability in the process."
BBR_the_southern_upsurge:0 "The Socialist Southern Upsurge"
BBR_the_southern_upsurge_desc:0 "The Party needs more support at once, and the reactionaries need to be culled. A campaign for Southern Socialism will emphasize joining the party while reporting local reactionaries to the authorities and removing them from political and economic influence. This will help our party grow at a greater rate."
BBR_a_party_with_a_state:0 "A Party with a State"
BBR_a_party_with_a_state_desc:0 "While party membership has increased, it is time to finalize the party's control. All non-purged members of the nation will be registered with the New Communist League, and our bureaucracy will be organized so that party ranking and position are one and the same, for the Party is the People."
BBR_total_employment:0 "State Employment"
BBR_total_employment_desc:0 "With the heights of the economy controlled by the NCL and all members of society being NCL members it is time to end unemployment and ensure all contribute to socialism. Full employment will be required and workers placed in areas that best suit the needs of the state, with the state finalizing central economic planning in the process."
BBR_sp_centralists:0 "Socialist Party Centralists"
BBR_sp_centralists_desc:0 "The Socialist Party Centralist Faction has come to power under James Ford and his so-called 'Browderist-Fordist' faction. Supporting a centrally guided economy, strong leadersip, and limited reforms, the faction is considered the least ideological of the Vanguardists."
BBR_workers_market:0 "The Workers Market"
BBR_workers_market_desc:0 "While capitalist enterprises must be ended, the worker's market will be tolerated for the good of the nation. With price controls in place, workers and family businesses that do not grow too large will be allowed to sell their goods to one another while government control of large businesses will be mandatory."
BBR_working_the_bourgeosie:0 "Have the Bourgeosie Bend the Knee"
BBR_working_the_bourgeosie_desc:0 "Capitalist ownership must end, and so it will. But, members of the bourgeosie and middle-class do have experience in management and setting prices. So long as they bend the knee to the party and embrace socialism (and lower wages), we will put them to work at once to advance socialism."
BBR_socialist_civic_identity:0 "Socialist Civic Identity"
BBR_socialist_civic_identity_desc:0 "Our civic identity must come from a shared sense of responsibility to the common good and socialism, not to race or other such nationalisms including the most unstable forms of class warfare. A socialist civic identity will promote loyalty to socialism and the state, around which anyone can be a citizen if they recognize this."
BBR_unite_the_left:0 "Corral the Left"
BBR_unite_the_left_desc:0 "The left is still sadly unstable, with some socialists attacking us for being too radical in our methods, while those on our left call us sellouts. Worse, the liberal left believe we were wrong to install a socialist government from the top down. We must pressure the left to conform to the SPA, rewarding loyalty and punishing deviation."
BBR_purge_radicals:0 "Purge Radicals"
BBR_purge_radicals_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts, the most radical communists still hold out against us, as do the remaining nationalist and NOI cells. There are also radical liberals who still openly call for a liberal constitution, and even a chunk of the African Blood Brotherhood. A short but efficient purge is in order to stabilize society and leave the SPA in command."
BBR_required_unionization:0 "Unionize Yesterday"
BBR_required_unionization_desc:0 "To not unionize is to simply undermine other members of the working class in a bid to appeal to capitalists. The Party will help, and pressure, all members of the working class to join our unions so that the working class may be better represented."
BBR_counter_reactionaries:0 "Counter Reactionaries"
BBR_counter_reactionaries_desc:0 "While our nation was founded on progress, reactionaries sought to abuse the novelty of the country for their own ends. Counter-Reactionary propaganda against the political right in both white and black communities will see help end their influence. Remaining organizers for their causes will be penalized, or worse."
BBR_government_built_plants:0 "Building Our Own Industry"
BBR_government_built_plants_desc:0 "We need our own industry if we are to survive in a world of industrialization, which will also push us closer to economic advancement and true socialism. Government planned factories shall be built at once, advancing the production of consumer goods."

BBR_overthrow_of_capital:0 "The Overthrow of Capital"
BBR_overthrow_of_capital_desc:0 "Capital will not negotiated for.

BBR_de_leonist_elections:0 "De Leonist Elections"

BBR_radicalized_unions_desc:0 "Not all unions seem willing to engage in revolutionary action, but that will change.

BBR_equality_of_wealth:0 "Equality of Wealth"
BBR_equality_of_wealth_desc:0 "Property ownership is still uneven, as is savings due to a still present non-capitalist upper-middle and even wealthy class. Wealth shall be redistributed for equity and only personal property, not private property, will be legally enforced. In return for their wealth, they will get some extra workers coupons in the future."
BBR_class_consciousness:0 "Southern Class Consciousness"
BBR_class_consciousness_desc:0 "In the South, the elite have used race consciousness to overcome the actual truth of class struggle. We will overcome this superstructure!

BBR_workers_coupons_desc:0 "Workers Coupons shall take the place of money, which was abused by capitalists to accumulate mass amounts of wealth and underpay workers.

BBR_red_militias:0 "Red Militia Justice"
BBR_red_militias_desc:0 "The Militias are a truly democratic means of organizing our internal, and external, security forces.

BBR_rubber_stamped_urbanization:0 "Rubber-Stamped Urbanization"
BBR_rubber_stamped_urbanization_desc:0 "The TUC being based from the bottom-up does not mean it cannot aid in central planning. The TUC will come to internal agreements on needed industrialization and urbanization, and hire certain unions to be tasked with it."
BBR_organize_tenant_farmers:0 "Organize Tenant Farmers"
BBR_organize_tenant_farmers_desc:0 "Tenant Farmers are the most abused workers in our economy. They will need to be better organized into a radicalized Southern Tenant Farmers Union if they are to be part of a larger solidarity-based economy and have their class consciousness raised."

BBR_intellectual_appeals_desc:0 "The Intellectuals in the Commune of France and other syndicalist nations have gotten along well with Black Intellectuals, and the two groups should work together to appeal to the remaining skeptics of the Black intellectual class to argue as to why our way forward is the future. Higher education will be a special target for this."
BBR_accelerate_integration:0 "Accelerate Integration"
BBR_accelerate_integration_desc:0 "It is time to no longer accept racial dynamics! Not only will segregation and race hatred be severly penalized, but quotes will be placed on state-influenced industries to encourage race-mixing. Meanwhile, we will make arguments on behalf of race integration."

BBR_approach_local_socialists:0 "Approach Local Socialists"
BBR_approach_local_socialists_desc:0 "While we do not see eye-to-eye on all issues, the socialist's influence among the working class is obvious, and we must credit their militias support of the nation. Thankfully, their moderate wing can be won over via negotiations with unions, increased wages, and lower working hours for workers."
BBR_approach_the_afp:0 "Working with the AFP"
BBR_approach_the_afp_desc:0 "Likely the most fervent supporters of our cause are the local AFP supporters and militias in the area, with our regional AFP being more unambiguously pro-Black than the national AFP. By encouraging party ties and providing rural support, we can cement our support among them and farmers."
BBR_crush_race_separatists:0 "Crush Race Extremists"
BBR_crush_race_separatists_desc:0 "Pockets of Race Nationalists still exist throughout the nation, namely the Klan, NDWL and ODP among whites and the NOI, UNIA and African Blood Brotherhood among blacks. By rooting out their most active supporters and shutting down their remaining operations we can stop those who would encourage race war amongst the American people."

BBR_deport_anarchists_desc:0 "The most extreme left radicals, namely the Fosterites under Haywood and Black Jacobins under Davis, are still causing problems in their outposts, plotting against our government and attacking perceived class traitors and capitalists.

BBR_american_recruitment_effort:0 "Mass Recruitment Effort"
BBR_american_recruitment_effort_desc:0 "We need soldiers now if we are going to hold our own against our newfound enemies.

BBR_integration_through_service:0 "Integration through Patriotism"
BBR_integration_through_service_desc:0 "Our army command is still reluctant to adopt full integration to not only the military, but the country, believing that race-relations are not strong enough. The American Union Bill will settle this as training will incorporate full integration and drill soldiers to put command over race, while our nation will see a patriotic campaign emphasizing our shared Americanism and propaganda."
BBR_american_traditions:0 "American Traditions"
BBR_american_traditions_desc:0 "While some in our nation associate America unequivocally with race hatred this is not true, as race-extremists attempted to destroy and betray the American Nation. By adopting American traditions, especially the flag, anthem, salutes and holidays, and speaking at length about our right as a continuation of America, we will cement a national identity."
BBR_fair_play:0 "Economic Fair Play"
BBR_fair_play_desc:0 "The issue is not, as the socialists view it, that Capitalism is inherently evil, but that it has come to be dominated by too few men without scruples. By passing anti-trust laws, further regulation of major companies to prevent price-gouging and inheritance, and progressive taxation, we can level the playing field for those attempting to compete in the marketplace."
BBR_paternal_economics:0 "For the Public Good"
BBR_paternal_economics_desc:0 "While leveling the playing field was helpful, it is not enough. We must go a stop further and provide minimum wage laws, a Federal Security commission for economic stability, and the nationalization of new federal lands and resources. This will accompany the subsidizing of promising consumer industries, education, and research. With that, we will provide jobs and goods for our people."

BBR_captain_at_the_helm_desc:0 "While it is important for a democratic outlet in the legislative branch to provide for the people, it's equally as important for a strong executive to provide stability, security and unity to their nation. General 'Captain' Young and his military clique will steer for a forward-thinking executive office that will see our nation the most prosperous in the world."
BBR_ally_long:0 "Union State Outreach"
BBR_ally_long_desc:0 "The American Union State is not perfect by any means but it is at least less hostile to us than syndicalists who view us as usurping black socialism and western powers desiring to occupy us. Perhaps we can work a deal with them to recognize our territory, and potential reintegration down the line?"

Jones' Peace Party has pulled through in the election, with their appeals to pacifism, tolerance and Christian morality appealing to even voters who view some of their specific tenants as unorthodox. The New Republic shall be united with the message of Peace!"
BBR_cash_only:0 "Cash Only"
BBR_cash_only_desc:0 "It is time to end the tyranny of pretend currency called 'credit' and the thrift associated with it.

Meanwhile we will give a tax break to community banks based on this model."
BBR_modesty_codes:0 "Modesty Codes"
BBR_modesty_codes_desc:0 "Many have given into vices such as alcoholism and cheating that destroy not only them but their families and society at large, something we are now in a position to legislate out of existence. Alcohol, gambling, adultery, smoking and publicly engaging in profanity or unbecoming dress wear shall be made illegal and liable to a fine if engaged in, with the sale of the worst vices carrying potential jail time."
BBR_collective_management:0 "Encourage Collective Management"
BBR_collective_management_desc:0 "We understand that supporting capitalism need not be at odds with communities. Collective management of properties, businesses and other profitable ventures should be encouraged via a tax credit, with a larger reward for those businesses who use the money saved from collective management and communal living to sell at lower prices to our citizens when possible."
BBR_economic_independence:0 "Economic Independence"
BBR_economic_independence_desc:0 "Stopping the reliance on loans and banks was a good start but still there are too many individuals and communities who are economically dependent on unneeded ventures when energies could be directed towards truly productive activities.

BBR_feed_the_poor:0 "Feed the Poor"
BBR_feed_the_poor_desc:0 "With much of money saved from ending economic dependence increasingly going to communities and churches it is time to further help those whom Jesus said would always be with us, the poor.

BBR_anti_corruption_campaign_desc:0 "It is no surprise that with the chaotic and sudden start of our Republic that corruption remains an issue, with many bribing bureaucrats to 'speed things along' or look the other way.

BBR_multi_racial_churches:0 "Multi-Racial Congregations"
BBR_multi_racial_churches_desc:0 "Sadly despite the power of religion in unifying many churches remain separated on the basis of race. We must coordinate with local pastors to encourage interracial tolerance and yes even congregations, and encourage whites to visit black churches! All churches that fulfill this goal will gain bargaining power within the NCC."
BBR_power_of_faith:0 "The Power of Faith"
BBR_power_of_faith_desc:0 "If there is a universal empowerment available to all it is in faith.

BBR_reject_races:0 "Reject All Racialism"
BBR_reject_races_desc:0 "It is not enough to tolerate one another on the basis of race, but to abolish the category all together. There is no Black or White Race in the Bible, making the category meaningless. From now on racial distinctions within our public system will no longer be recognized and the churches will be encouraged to spread the word that race is dead now that faith has replaced it."
BBR_spiritual_patriotism:0 "Spiritual Patriotism"
BBR_spiritual_patriotism_desc:0 "With the old racialism destroyed in favor of faith, we need to cement our national identity to unify those within our borders.

BBR_calm_racial_tensions:0 "Calm Racial Tensions"
BBR_calm_racial_tensions_desc:0 "While legally whites and blacks have equal rights under our Republic that certainly does not mean that they enjoy always cordial relations.

BBR_rural_schools:0 "Rural Schools"
BBR_rural_schools_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly due to the conditions of the Jim Crow South many black children in rural areas are badly undereducated for the task of taking on the future economy.

BBR_expand_nnbl:0 "Expand the NNBL"
BBR_expand_nnbl_desc:0 "The NNBL is the backbone of large scale Black Business in America, though it could not operate in the South with great ease.

BBR_lower_insurance_prices:0 "More Affordable Insurance"
BBR_lower_insurance_prices_desc:0 "Insurance has been a longtime struggle of Black Americans, with many resorting to mutual aid types societies.

BBR_affirmative_action_desc:0 "The damage Jim Crow has done to black America can not be understated and even now racism exists.

BBR_fine_hate_groups:0 "Disarm Extremists"
BBR_fine_hate_groups_desc:0 "While militants stand fervently by their rights to firearms this is little more than a ruse that gives them an opening to enact violence on those they disapprove of or attempt to overthrow the government as they already have.

BBR_march_against_oppressions_desc:0 "Despite our accomplishments many whites and are still business owners and principles and reluctant to give up on segregation, even if no longer have state backing, and many blacks feel similarly.

bbr.1.t:0 "A State Under Siege!"
bbr.1.d:0 "The Black Belt has broken free of the iron fist of the Old Democratic Party and the NDWL but the situation is far from under control and we will need to defend ourself from the Constitutional Republican of America! Already groups ranging from syndicalists to liberals to nationalists have pledged loyalty to the new state but it is clear each wishes to dominate it. With W.E.B as the appointed president by a small convention made up largely of SPA leaders hoping to appeal to both the center and the left, a rocky road is ahead of us. The first question is whether or not to enact a draft of black citizens in order to defend the Republic which while messy may be needed to defend our, and their, new freedoms. Some of the SPA including DuBois are not enthusiastic about the idea but our military leaders are pushing us to do it out of fear of certain death if we do not."
bbr.1.a:0 "Enact a Draft"
bbr.1.b:0 "Publicly Oppose a Draft"

amcivwar.1312.t:0 "Our own units?"
amcivwar.1312.d:0 "In our struggle for independence, some have suggested we copy the unit styles of our foes. This is nonsense. We are our own country now, and we will have our own units as well!"
amcivwar.1312.a:0 "Distance ourselves from the CAR"

bbr.2.t:0 "Reinforcements Arrive"
bbr.2.d:0 "Syndicalist's and Liberals in nearby territories have identified with the Black Belt's fight against the CAR and their current socialist leanings, arriving to aid in any way they can. With these groups no longer needing to be underground it has afforded us direct aid and a chance to better arm them. However, it also means the CAR has less internal dissent to deal with, putting more pressure on us to defend our territory. As a result the SPA radicals are pressuring us to ask for additional troops from the CSA, although this would give their faction additional influence."
bbr.2.a:0 "Very well"
bbr.2.b:0 "We are fine as is"

bbr.3.t:0 "Elijah Muhammad Arrives"
bbr.3.d:0 "A Group with chapters throughout the nation, the Nation of Islam was largely based out of the North until it caught wind of the increasing instability of the Black Belt. Barely tolerated by the CSA and AUS both out of hope they would aid rebels in CAR and out of fear moving against a prominent pro-Black group (albeit a reactionary one) would alienate potential black recruits, they have increasing sent funding and rebels in the South. With the emergence of the Black Belt Revolt Elijah Muhammad and his entourage have arrived in the territory with a large number of supporters trickling in. The rumors that he also has allies within, of all places, the Young Klan due to shared collaboration as relating to racial separation was part of the reason he was confident he and his men could safetly arrive has not endeared him to our government."

bbr.4.d:0 "The Universal Negro Improvement Association and the Nation of Islam have agreed to collaborate in what is being nicknamed a Nationalist Campaign, which they call a Negro Liberation Campaign, with the Moorish People's Temple despite their previously tense relationship in competing for the support of right-wing black nationalists. They advocate for ending conflict with the NDWL, stating that the liberal and syndicalist ideologies the other ideologies represent is more incongruent with the needs of the young Republic than the white race nationalists whom can be convinced to stick to 'their territory', and that Black Americans should look East, not West, for unity. This is obviously dangerous to our government's desire to finish off the ODP and work with local whites but they continue to pledge troops and commanders so long as the conflict goes on, as they say this does not mean they will accept bending the knee to any white faction either. Left Radicals such Paul Robeson and Harry Haywood are nonetheless calling on us to end the 'reactionary threat' now and instead rely on socialist supporters, stating that the Black Reactionary is a snake in our garden waiting to strike, with  saying they are potentially . Others are reluctant, noting that their support is massively important and we are in no position to oppose them, even if turning a blind eye will allow them to push up their recruitment numbers. The national syndicalist African Blood Brotherhood in particular says we should not shut down Black Nationalists while our Republic still needs support."

bbr.5.t:0 "Garvey Denounces Us"
bbr.5.d:0 "From Liberia, Marcus Garvey has denounced the arrest of American UNIA leader James R. Stewart and NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, claiming we are keeping the 'hostage' and that our government has sold out to socialists and Jews. We are feeling the heat of cracking down on the nationalists as young men refuse to sign up for the army and nationalists cause internal damage. With the even more radical NOI calling for war we may have bit off more than we can chew. The African Blood Brotherhood is the only wing of our party that has somewhat cordial relationships with these groups and their followers, and under Duse Muhammad and Cyril Briggs they are offering to undo the 'damage' our government has done if given top cabinet and military positions. Those whom view the ABB as ultra-nationalists in socialist clothing or as a bizarre cult itself claim we should refuse but other SPA members claim that is the only way our government could hope to overcome our enemies."

###ABB IN POWER###
bbr.6.t:0 "Nationalists Released!"
bbr.6.d:0 "The Nationalists we imprisoned have been released by the African Blood Brotherhood after they agreed to be loyal to the government and cease advocating for an Old Democratic alliance. In return, they have been given voting positions in an expanded Congress as well, which as a unicameral congress makes them heavily influential to the annoyance of some other left radicals, although they have vowed not to introduce legislation that would risk undoing their de facto 'parole'. Meanwhile the ABB has sent written works of their organs, the Crusader and the Hamitic League of the World, to new recruits and officers, increasing their membership roster from members of the military."
bbr.6.a:0 "Solve one problem, create another"

bbr.7.t:0 "Duse Muhammad Elected!"
bbr.7.d:0 "Introducing sudden legislation for a snap election, the ABB has put forward their Executive Heads, Duse Muhammad and Cyril Briggs, as new candidates to run the government, calling for an on-the-spot election in Congress while some left syndicalist leaders such as Paul Robeson, Harry Haywood and Ben Davis were called for a meeting with CSA officers and representatives. With the backing of the National Syndicalists, the newly appointed Nationalists and a small number of syndicalists whom agreed they were preferable to the current government, he was elected. DuBois sees this as little more than what virtually every other political faction views it as, a coup. The head of our military, General Charles 'Captain' Young, is having none of the most recent bout of government incompetence following this coup by extremists, saying that if DuBois backs him and his military faction by using his emergency powers to give Young executive powers and deliver him SPA backing he will remove the coup leaders from power and stabilize the ongoing conflict so it doesn't swallow the Republic."

bbr.7.b:0 "It's not right"

bbr.8.t:0 "ABB in Power!"
bbr.8.d:0 "The African Blood Brotherhood has seized control of the government and has begun to remove oppositional members of Congress from office. A most recent article by ABB intellectual leader Cyril Briggs has called on the Black Belt to join the ABB as soon as possible to aid the cause, and they are currently pressuring remaining socialists to convert by force, jailing those who don't. This has most controversially lead to an arrest warrent for A. Philip Randolph, a reformist SPA leader who has since fled the country for a more socialist friendly one."
bbr.8.a:0 "Stay the Course!"

bbr.8000.t:0 "Potential Allies"
bbr.8000.d:0 "The so-called 'Red Totalists' is a loose grouping of left vanguardists who mutually dislike one another, and with the IWW and left-wing SPA in the region they make up the left revolutionary forces in the region. Despite our proclaimed devotion to anti-imperialism and worker liberation, our policies so far have left us controversial in these corners, who are demanding we show our devotion to the revolution by sending supplies to the Commune of France at once. Likewise, they are denouncing our 'state capitalist' policies and request greater autonomy for the syndicate unions, although we believe we could win over the Red Totalists if we give into some of their demands, followed by gradually absorbing and retiring their current leadership. Of course, this would be costly in the short-term, causing some to float the idea of brining in UNIA to provide support in their place and immediently move to absorb the Revolutionary Left as a whole, in one swift strike. Briggs himself advises working more closely with the left, despite Duse Muhammad's former connections with UNIA."

bbr.8001.t:0 "The White Proletariat"
bbr.8001.d:0 "While our recent policies have left us with repossessing many businesses and lands owned by middle and upper-class whites to be instead controlled by the state or given to allies, there is a controversy regarding the 'white proletariat'. Cyril Briggs views them as a potential revolutionary force, and believes we should leave them as are to work alongside black workers with so long as they recognize this is a Black State, and do not attempt to climb the ranks internally. Likewise, he would be willing to sponsor them to move to revolutionary nations that are majority white so long as they are allies. The right-wing of the ABB on the other hand, while willing to ally and support white revolutionary nations abroad, view the domestic white proletariats and farmers in our region as having built their wealth on the back of whites, and think we should possess much of their existing wealth and lands, and place many of those who may cause problems, or can not afford to have their wealth possessed state communes to work alongside other reactionaries."

bbr.8002.d:0 "Duse Muhammad has been revealed as the Black Pharoah, a title given to the Head of State of the Black State and the head of the ABB. Despite the name, it officially is a Republican title that is passed down via election among Party Elites, although some are wondering how seriously the title should be taken and if Mohamed Ali should still behave as a Party Leader or keep himself out of the limelight and built up in a near religious manner to help build a Civic Religion modeled on the ABB's conception of Ancient Egypt."

bbr.8004.t:0 "Fate of the Black bourgeoisie"
bbr.8004.d:0 "Until now, we have kept the Black bourgeoisie who have not resisted us somewhat intact, with their largest enterprises (and incomes) now being officially state owned properties with them managing it on our behalf under the new state corporations and syndicates. However with the handing out of titles and state properties some are wondering if we should extend these priviledges to members of the Black bourgeoisie who appear loyal to us to increase their loyalty and take advantage of their managerial skills, or if we should focus on empowering only long-time party members, in the process weakening the old bourgeoisie in favor of pure party rule."

bbr.8005.t:0 "Robert Church Jr. Killed"
bbr.8005.d:0 "The Crusaders have reported that Robert Church Jr. has been killed due to his connections to the New Republican Party and his funding of 'liberal militants'. A wealthy businessman who inherited a prominent savings bank from his father, it was one of the wealthiest organizations in the National Negro Business League, which is currently being dissolved and peeled apart by the Crusaders and our militants, making Church's death the latest in a series of killings of wealthy blacks who oppose the ABB and leaving his assets in our hands."
bbr.8005.a:0 "A Success"

bbr.8006.t:0 "Faith in Education"
bbr.8006.d:0 "Despite our best efforts which include illegalizing the Peace Party and arresting the charlatan Father Divine, the more mainstream Christian Churces continue to survive and even thrive despite some turning against it in favor of our National Mythos or even socialist materialism. This has lead to pushes in the ABB to emphasize discrediting Christianity in schools in favor of what the ABB views the natural faith of Black Culture, which is a seemingly strange mixture of materialism and appeals to more ancient traditions the ABB claims belongs to Blacks."
bbr.8006.a:0 "A Great Initiative"

### Nationalists Tolerated ###

bbr.9.t:0 "Nationalists Parade Treaty!"
bbr.9.d:0 "In response to the ongoing casualties of the war, the Nationalists claim they have a way of ending the war in short order, having supposedly secured a treaty with the CAR leadership, especially the ODP and Young Klan. Claiming that the CAR and Black Belt have a shared interest in standing against 'Race-mixing, financial masters and Jewish Power' they are calling on our government to appoint their coalition to power to end the war! Outside their circles their calls have been decisive, with some believing this to be essentially treason, others viewing them as racial elitists themselves selling out our moral cause and finally many viewing this as an opportunity to end the war even if they don't agree with the Nationalists personal views. With the CAR making sure to make civilian casualties against our population devastating when possible to put down the revolt once and for all, many are fearful of what and who they will lose if they do not accept. The left-wing of the SPA of course still desires them imprisoned for their treachery."
bbr.9.a:0 "We can do nothing"
bbr.9.b:0 "Arrest their leaders"

bbr.10.t:0 "March on [BBR.GETCAPITAL]"
bbr.10.d:0 "The Nationalists have decided to march on the congressional capital to show their dissatisfaction with the ongoing conflict in a call for peace and a new alliance across race-nationalist lines which they claim will end in not just Black prosperity but a "Black-American Empire". Claiming that we had and have a moral obligation to accept the terms of their treaty for 'the sake of saving Black lives' their numbers have continued to swell among those enamored with their many promises. Even worse, our intelligence operations tell us they have received supplies and support from sections of the ODP and Young Klan to aid them in this endeavor. The SPA and much of the military leadership are of course furious at this development and recommend routing them at the march, although this would be costly during a time of war. In response, General Charles Young has offered to not only end the threat at the March but if appointed as a regent implement policies to account for these loses and create a more battle ready state while continuing to end the national emergency of the Nationalist insurgency."

bbr.11.t:0 "Nationalist March Succeeds"
bbr.11.d:0 "The Nationalists marched on the capital today armed to the teeth and with a large following of thousands of supporters whilst most of our fighting men were busy on the front lines. DuBois, the SPA and many liberals in Congress evacuated in response and claimed they would return to avenge the backstabbing UNIA and NOI. Despite their cries however the Nationalists claimed success and called on an end to the war, with only the African Blood Brotherhood and a small handful of liberals remaining from the Old Congress after they had taken power."
bbr.11.a:0 "We are in their hands now"

### Nationalists Take Power ###

bbr.12.t:0 "Leadership Election"
bbr.12.d:0 "The Nationalists may have taken power but they have not settled the question of the dominant power in their Congress. While UNIA has a larger number of followers the NOI manages to compensate for its sizeable militia and increased fanaticism among those who do believe in the 'Prophet', Elijah Muhammad. Furthermore, the UNIA is suffering from a lack of united leadership itself as their actual leader, Marcus Garvey, is still in Liberia building an UNIA organization there. With the NOI appealing to their militancy and clear leadership and the UNIA to their more palatable platform to the public, it was a near deadlock in the Congress. Eventually they both appealed to the remaining nationalist-leaning members of Congress whom hadn't fled with the socialists to use their remaining influence to act as kingmaker and broker a backroom deal on each of their behalf's. With Wilfred Adolphus Domingo as the leading negotiator and diplomat between them, only one could come out on top."

### UNIA Takes Power ###

bbr.1200.t:0 "Mission from UNIA"
bbr.1200.d:0 "UNIA has been growing its influence within our nation and is using its diplomatic connections to push for unification with the Black Belt. Marcus Garvey, head of the Liberia-UNIA is demanding that we comply, and the funding he has received has given him his own 'African Legion' militia. Naturally, UNIA promises us rewards if we comply and threatens us with force if we do not."

bbr.1201.d:0 "Liberia has caved to our demands! With our mission to Liberia being a success thanks to the efforts of UNIA in both nations, the original founder of UNIA and greatest promoter of Black Nationalism in the world, Marcus Garvey, has returned to retake the mantel as the leader of the organization after he was deported from the country by the FBI. As James Stewart has officially been standing in for him, he will have to comply in return for being named the heir to Garvey."

bbr.1202.t:0 "Return of Garvey"
bbr.1202.d:0 "Liberia has refused our demands! Marcus Garvey and his African Legion and UNIA is in exile after being pushed out by Liberian government and has returned home to retake the mantel as the leader of the organization after he was deported from the country by the FBI. As James Stewart has officially been standing in for him, he will have to comply in return for being named the heir to Garvey, who promises that Liberia will pay for its treachery."
bbr.1202.a:0 "At least he survived"

bbr.1203.t:0 "Conquest of America"
bbr.1203.d:0 "We have taken the United States! Naturally, we have few citizens in this region who qualify as pure Black citizens and we expect massive resistance if we attempt to hold it. As such we are being pressured by the cabinet to release the United States under a White Separatist Faction named the Young Klan, a group of White Nationalists who have worked with Black Nationalists before and promise to enforce racial laws that agree with ours as well as an alliance and payments. Of course, we could attempt to dominate the region directly and use its resources for a Black Empire of sorts."

bbr.1205.t:0 "Young Klan Offers"
bbr.1205.d:0 "The faction of the Young Klan that has favored working with the Black Nationalists have reacted to our recent racial policies with mixed results, disliking the treatment of local whites but acknowledging it is tolerable so long as white ethnostates exist.

bbr.1206.d:0 "We can not ignore racial realities established by genetics and biology, and as such we must decide what to do with those who are of mixed-race heritage living in our nation as Garvey has made their inferiority and impure bloodline a known problem with our brand of Black Nationalism. We could make it legal to only join higher UNIA offices if one is a pure-blooded Black while only working with racially approved citizens or go further, and further segregation to make them considered a new racial category to be separated from pure Blacks."

bbr.1207.t:0 "Liberty Halls Expand"
bbr.1207.d:0 "Liberty Halls are the common official meeting places for our organization.

bbr.1207.a:0 "A fine idea"
bbr.1207.b:0 "It's not needed"

bbr.1208.t:0 "Back to Africa"
bbr.1208.d:0 "With Liberia back in our hands it is time to start achieving Garvey's dreams to send more Black citizens there.

bbr.1212.t:0 "Jews Flee!"

bbr.1213.d:0 "An unorthodox religious group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites have become increasingly active in our lands and are best known for their belief that Black Americans are the true descendents of the Tribe of Israel. We have had contact with a handful of these groups, some of whom are Black Nationalist and Supremacist, however other Black Israelites are not. As such the nationalists such as the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations have asked us to run out the non-nationalist factions. Of course, some within our government think the whole theology needs to be crushed and poses an internal threat to our power."

bbr.1215.t:0 "Liquor Smuggled"
bbr.1215.d:0 "With the NOI's banning of liquor, an underground movement devoted to smuggling liquor has been created.

### Liberalism Prevails ###

bbr.13.t:0 "Nationalists Fail!"
bbr.13.d:0 "The Nationalist March on our congress failed today despite their numbers, with our army managing to route them and arrest the March leaders. Elijah Muhammad has fled the nation while most of the UNIA leadership has already been arrested. While some are upset the resources it cost us to end this would-be coup will destroy our nation the socialists claim it was necessary and are celebrating their victory over reactionaries."
bbr.13.a:0 "Very well"

bbr.14.t:0 "Future of the Nation"
bbr.14.d:0 "With the Nationalists having been felled and a lack of an internal common enemy there is now widespread disagreement between socialists and liberals on the future of the nation. The Syndicalist, Communist and other revolutionary left factions explicitly want us to include the 'People's Amendments' within our constitution which will restructure Congress partially after the Commune of France and have trade union representatives elected directly by workers become the largest force of our Congress and guarantees of 'rights to the full value of their labor'. Furthermore, it will limit the ability of pro-Capitalist parties to challenge the syndicalist system though they disagree on how far to go in this regard. However, the first draft will at least strongly limit capitalist wealth and the ability to found large businesses, disallow 'capitalist and reactionary' influence of the political system and illegalize 'collaboration with extreme, anti-Democratic and/or foreign pro-capitalist and pro-imperialist forces'. \n\nThe liberals and progressives have accused the revolutionary left of attempting to have a monopoly on political power and of de facto excluding non-Revolutionary left forces, calling it a de facto dictatorship, an accusation the syndicalists resent. They have put forward the Constitution of the Black Republic, which contains universal suffrage within a traditional political model with regional voting, separation of powers and the limitation of government power including in allowing some level of private property, which they say is necessary not only for liberty but for economic growth, investment and prosperity. With Du Bois having executive power and a major political wind since felling the right-nationalists, he will have to decide on one."

bbr.15.t:0 "Socialists Celebrate!"
bbr.15.d:0 "The People's Amendments have been adopted and with it the revolutionary left and socialist trade unions are celebrating although liberals and business owners are less sure of what to think. However as there are many internal disagreements on the nature of the socialist system and how far it should go many are calling for a snap election, especially Paul Robeson who essentially leads the orthodox syndicalist faction and is a strong defender of an economically egalitarian worker-run democracy while also supporting revolution against current capitalist forces and believes that the Red Militias are needed to protect workers rights. Running from what commentors call his right is James Ford's Centralist Socialists and Du Bois' wing of the Socialist Party. Both believe in a more gradual transition to socialist and maintaining some elements of the market where it may be of help, however Du Bois defends decentralization and mutual aid whereas Ford is a longtime ally 'Browderist' and believes in a centralized form of socialism with a pan socialist-vanguard and political pragmatism to protect it. This has led to accusations of Ford being little more than an opportunist by others but his seeming pragmatism and clear policies has led to much popularity."
bbr.15.a:0 "Victory"

bbr.16.t:0 "The Left-Vanguard Runs"
bbr.16.d:0 "It appears as though Robeson is not only being challenged from his right but from his left. Two politicians have appeared to give him a run for his money, 'Fosterite' and Trade Union Unity League leader Harry Haywood being considered the more radical of them. Calling for a total revolution Haywood chastises Robeson for stopping short of what he considers a full-revolution against the forces of reaction, stating that building the new worker's economy to accelerate towards Communism and destroying the imperialists and their structures, internally and externally, should come before all else. \n\nThe other is the 'Jacobin' Ben Davis who models his beliefs off of the French Faction of the same name and their inspiriations from the Russian Bolsheviks and ealier European Communist Parties. Believing in transitioning from a syndicalist structure to a Party-based one he is a strong believer in a strong leadership that will 'aid the worker in building a ready state to defend the revolution' while defending against anti-Communist forces, and in shifting the goals of the revolution from syndicalism to a 'Black-American Bolshevism' which can then be used to aid the Internationale. Robeson has criticisized both of them for 'betraying the worker to protect him'."

As the primary between them heats up it has come down to a race between the radical DuBois and the moderates who are split between the labor leader A.

Despite their unorthodox nature and Father Divine often being ridiculed for claiming to be God himself (a view he no longer brings up in public), their pacificism and emphasis on Christian morals has led to widespread sympathathies among local religious leaders not turned off by their other views and they have widespread support among Christians who view them as possible saviors of the Republic against both greed and radicalism, making them serious contenders in the election."

bbr.25.a:0 "Interesting"

bbr.26.t:0 "Red Mobs"
bbr.26.d:0 "Some members of the Red Guard are being accused of going too far in their efforts to hunt down reactionaries, arresting pastor's associated with right-wing policies as well as some members of the New Republican Party who supported pro-business policies. With the Red Guards sometimes beating them in the streets or worse, shall we reign them in?"
bbr.26.a:0 "Reign them in"
bbr.26.b:0 "Let it go for now"

bbr.27.t:0 "The liquidation of Faith"
bbr.27.d:0 "There can be no question that much of the reactionary nonsense in our communities is espoused by Christian Pastor's opposed to 'Godless Communism' and they continue to promote backwards social policies. As such we need to decide what to do with these churches, with the main proposals being to only shut down ones promoting reaction and some calling for a greater purge of religious conservatives from public conscience, including the old Peace Party activists as well as a more vigorous promotion of State Atheism."
bbr.27.a:0 "Shut down Reactionary Churches"
bbr.27.b:0 "Purge Conservatism"

bbr.28.t:0 "Haywood Denounces the Combined Syndicates!"
bbr.28.d:0 "Harry Haywood has denounced the Combined Syndicates as having been taken over by reactionary forces bent on destroying the very revolution it claims to support. Calling them social capitalists, he praised William Z. Foster's attempts to keep them from power and stated that we should be suspicious of them now, with some in the cabinet pushing for war."
bbr.28.a:0 "Let us declare war"
bbr.28.b:0 "Let us bide our time"

bbr.29.t:0 "Facing the New Communist League"
bbr.29.d:0 "The New Communist League has been one of our rivals on the Southern far-left for nearly a year now, and it is clear that Benjamin Davis does not appreciate our efforts so far. Criticizing our decentralized forces, intense criticism of union culture as reactionary, encouragement of the masses to clear out reactionary forces rather than doing it ourself and criticism of insufficiently socialist nations, Davis and his forces in the Socialist Congress believe that we acting dangerously by not setting more centralized economic planning, emphasizing a top-down party membership and over-relying on the Red Guards as being chaotic and destroying the country. What should we do?"
bbr.29.a:0 "Liquidate them directly"
bbr.29.b:0 "The Red Guards will eventually deal with them"

bbr.30.t:0 "Ben Davis Tried!"
bbr.30.d:0 "Benjamin Davis and his inner circle has been tried by the TUUL as having served reactionary forces posing as 'socialist' after his NCL organization came under increasingly intense attacks, to the point of most of its members being exiled, imprisoned or dead. Davis is attempting to claim that he was simply attempting to aid the revolution and that he is willing to live in exile. What is Davis' fate?"
bbr.30.a:0 "Firing Squad"
bbr.30.b:0 "Exile"

bbr.31.t:0 "James W. Ford Flees!"
bbr.31.d:0 "James W. Ford of the Socialist Party Centralists has fled the nation after the loss of his leadership election and our recent centralization of power. Fearing potential reprisal, he has appeared to move to a socialist nation that would be more accepting of his views, taking a briefcase of Party funds with him."
bbr.31.a:0 "Very Well"

bbr.32.t:0 "Harry Haywood Liquidated"
bbr.32.d:0 "Harry Haywood had no shortage of criticisms for our government, claiming that we were reactionary for not doing enough to emphasize collectivization among the masses, combating social reaction and imperialist influences in our culture and our 'overrelying' on bureaucratic procedures. Naturally this had led to suspiciouns of the TUUL and its various militia cells which refused to be absorbed into our government, and has caused for us to announce that Haywood was a social reactionary himself who needed to be liquidated. As such, he has already been arrested and executed and we with the head of the organization decapitated we need to decide whether to dismantle the TUUL altogether or keep a pro-government variant of it around."
bbr.32.a:0 "Destroy the TUUL"
bbr.32.b:0 "Puppet the TUUL"

bbr.33.t:0 "Seizing the IWIU"
bbr.33.d:0 "We need to deal with the primary syndicalist organization in our nation at once, with many criticizing our appeals to Vanguard Socialism. Paul Robeson however might be more amenable to our ideas if his organization was given some more leniency in their personal affairs so long as they continue to support our government."
bbr.33.a:0 "Offer Leniency"
bbr.33.b:0 "Arrest the Leadership"

bbr.34.t:0 "Destroying Black Reactionaries"
bbr.34.d:0 "Throughout the nation those activists and journalists still held affinity with the UNIA, NOI and the right-wing Liberal Parties are being arrested and either exiled, offered clemancy for confessions, imprisoned or executed. However, there is still debate over the nature of the African Blood Brotherhood and its National Syndicalist Views, which many view as as either syndicalist or nationalist depending on whom one talks to. While they will obviously have to join the central government and obey it if allowed to stay, there are those who view them as potentially treachorous."
bbr.34.a:0 "Destroy them"
bbr.34.b:0 "Absorb Them"

bbr.35.t:0 "Absorbing the Socialist Party"
bbr.35.d:0 "With James W. Ford now being recognized as the Head of the Socialist Party and his appointees being now leading the party we are steasily absorbing the other wings of the party, although the Social Democrats are reluctant to jump fully on board unless we offer them some favors, such as allowing some businesses to grow slightly larger before being potentially nationalized and appointing more of their wing to government."
bbr.35.a:0 "Agreed"
bbr.35.b:0 "No, purge those who refuse still"

bbr.36.t:0 "Capitalists Flee!"
bbr.36.d:0 "The Capitalist Class is fleeing the nation en masse as the workers take over factories and attack former strike breakers and owners. Landlords on the other hand are simply giving up their renting spaces, often asking for a small fee that they give up on when the Red Militias visit them. Of course, with the Capitalists running, some think we should detain them so some can stand trial for their behavior. There is also, of course, the problem of capital flight, as management being neglected until workers organize and the outflow of goods capitalists can take with them is causing a temporary deindustrialization."
bbr.36.a:0 "Stop them"
bbr.36.b:0 "Let them go"

bbr.37.t:0 "The Great Purge"
bbr.37.d:0 "The Great Purge is underway in the Black Belt with suspected opponents of the government in the military, public services and former militia associates being arrested en masse. The Jacobin Military Police are requesting additional surveillance to test the loyalties of certain members of the population, such as seeing if they will harbor fake political refugees or monitoring telephone services."
bbr.37.a:0 "Of Course"
bbr.37.b:0 "I think not"

bbr.38.t:0 "A Social Revolution"
bbr.38.d:0 "Across the nation, young radicals encouraged by the TUUL are liquidating former landlords and remaining petite-bourgeousie owners, assaulting teachers who still teach reactionary ideals around 'America' and are destroying those with backwards social views, especially among the religious classes. However, some local TUUL representatives think we should slow the revolution so as to focus on political rehabilitation of these offenders rather than destruction. Should we side with them or the Red Guards."
bbr.38.a:0 "Side with TUUL Leaders"
bbr.38.b:0 "Side with the Red Guard"

### Young Prevails ###

bbr.39.t:0 "George Washington Carver Dies!"
bbr.39.d:0 "One of America's greatest black scientists, George Washington Carver, has died today. Popular for his food recipes to produce peanut butter, Carver was involved in developing soil techniques to aid farmers and for his research into environmentalism. Hours after his death Tuskeegee Institute announced it would be honoring Carver and naming the Agricultural Department after him for his advancements, friendship with Booker T Washington and association with the Institute. As such there are pushes to build a government sponsored memorial for him at once."
bbr.39.a:0 "A Day of Mourning"

bbr.40.t:0 "Young as Head Executive!"
bbr.40.d:0 "With the Nationalists having been felled Charles Young rides through the Capital a national hero with an assembly of officers ranging from the young Henry Johnson to the elder Henry Flipper to the cheers of crowds, taking his place in the Congress as the Head Executive of the Nation after being granted emergency powers. He swears that he will restore stability at all costs, to the outrage of the New Communist League and TUUL, though both the right-leaning Republicans and left-leaning reformers seek his favor."
bbr.40.a:0 "Work more closely with the Left"
bbr.40.b:0 "Work more closely with the Right"
bbr.40.c:0 "Balance Both"

bbr.41.t:0 "Fate of Robeson"
bbr.41.d:0 "With our crackdown on the revolutionary left we are left with an internal controversy over the fate of Paul Robeson, leader of a representative organ of the IWW in our country. While Robeson is popular to the masses, his devotion to syndicalism is unnerving to many in the cabinet who suggest he be deported to the Commune of France. Of course, there will be a public outcry so we could try to work with him in private and promise some union related concessions to keep syndicalism at bay."
bbr.41.a:0 "Deport him"
bbr.41.b:0 "Work with him"

bbr.42.t:0 "TUUL Broken"
bbr.42.d:0 "Harry Haywood has retreated from the TUUL, moving to an Internationale nation in response to our raids on TUUL headquarters. Of course, he promises to continue the fight from afar creating calls for us to pursue him further, perhaps by sending agents from our war intelligence office."
bbr.42.a:0 "Send Spies"
bbr.42.b:0 "Leave him be"

bbr.43.t:0 "Harry Haywood Dies!"
bbr.43.d:0 "Harry Haywood was murdered in the Union of Britain earlier this day, having been poisoned by unknown assailants while giving an interview although it is an open opinion that the assassins belonged to our government, which is true. With the UoB and many far-leftists at home already furious, should we take credit to show our government is not to be underestimated?"
bbr.43.a:0 "Deny Everything"
bbr.43.b:0 "Take Credit"

bbr.44.t:0 "Unions demand contracts!"
bbr.44.d:0 "With our recent projects, the unions are demanding they be given even more favorable contracts. In order to appease them, we may need to give them the bulk of public building contracts despite the higher price, which would win over remaining parts of the SPA, especially James W. Ford's Centralists who are currently ambiguous in their attitude towards us until now."
bbr.44.a:0 "Grant the Contracts"
bbr.44.b:0 "Don't Grant the Contracts"

bbr.45.t:0 "Page demands Concessions!"
bbr.45.d:0 "The left-wing of the army under Thomas Page is demanding concessions in response to our crackdown on the left. They desire for us to cease our crackdowns on the left in the future, to grant Page a place on the leading army council and to swear we will not go to war with the Internationale. With rumors that Page helped Haywood escape the Black Belt in the first place and kept as much of the left militants as he could out of the raids, he is not exactly popular with the council, but denying him would deny us a great many men."
bbr.45.a:0 "Agreed"
bbr.45.b:0 "Disagree"

bbr.46.t:0 "State of the Judicial Branch"
bbr.46.d:0 "With the Judicial Branch in our nation still coming into existence many of our policies so far emulate the United States. However there are calls to stop making Judges appointable by political leaders at once, as it gives certain political factions too much influence over law. As such the judiciary would have an independent system for reviewing and appointing judges."
bbr.46.a:0 "Endorse it"
bbr.46.b:0 "Leave the current system in place"

bbr.47.t:0 "DuBois Condemns Cultural Policies"
bbr.47.d:0 "W.E.B. DuBois has condemned our governments cultural policy of embracing Americanism as oppressive to African American Identity and a step backwards for the country. While he has little power, his influence in the SPA is still felt and doing some damage to our reputation, meaning we should likely put forward those willing to debate him on behalf of our party."
bbr.47.a:0 "Debate him"
bbr.47.b:0 "Ignore him"

bbr.48.t:0 "Enacting Roman Law?"
bbr.48.d:0 "With our legal system still forming right now Common Law, based on the legal code of the United States, is the norm. However most in our government would prefer what they feel is a more reliable, fair and centralized system of legal code by adopting Roman Law, in which codified statutes overrides past judicial decisions and interpretations. This will allow us to detail true American Law without having judges redefine it whenever it is convenient, although we would have to accept the cost of restructuring the legal system."
bbr.48.a:0 "Adopt Roman Law"
bbr.48.b:0 "Leave it be, for now"

bbr.49.t:0 "Rise of Jazz"
bbr.49.d:0 "A new form of music is taking the country, and Louis Armstrong and other musicians in the "Jazz Movement" are being influential celebrities that went from playing in establishments that offer liquor, dancing and other services to playing on a national stage and in record studios. The craze for Jazz is only increasing, to the outrage of religious groups who call the music sinful."
bbr.49.a:0 "Interesting"
bbr.49.b:0 "Denounce it"

bbr.50.t:0 "Interest in Creole Spikes"
bbr.50.d:0 "Interest in Creole culture has skyrocketed in some of our higher education and in popular media, as some view it as an identity that is more wholly identified with the Black Belt. As a result, some sociologists and linguists request funding to research, and advance, Creole culture to the public at large, including teaching it as a secondary language."
bbr.50.a:0 "Of course"
bbr.50.b:0 "No"

bbr.51.t:0 "Robeson Demands a Seat!"
bbr.51.d:0 "With our creation of the Labor Board, Paul Robeson is demanding a seat on the board to represent the syndicalist IWIU. While this would increase syndicalist influence in the short-run, it could allow us to take the edge off their radicalism while gaining their support."
bbr.51.a:0 "Bring him in"
bbr.51.b:0 "He's too radical"

bbr.5100.t:0 "IWIU Shrinks"
bbr.5100.d:0 "The IWIU has suffered falling influence thanks to our recent economic reforms, and as a result syndicalism and even radical socialism holds less influence over the population, although Paul Robeson himself remains both popular and a syndicalist throughout this recent recline. Nonetheless, it appears as though we won't need to worry about leftist revolution at the moment."
bbr.5100.a:0 "Great!"

bbr.52.t:0 "Praise from Brazil"
bbr.52.d:0 "Brazil is praising our efforts to promote international peace alongside our anti-socialism and increase in diplomatic efforts. Perhaps we should use this to push for closer relations?"
bbr.52.a:0 "No, just accept the praise"
bbr.52.b:0 "Ask for a non-aggression Pact"
bbr.52.c:0 "We should enter an alliance"

bbr.53.t:0 "Brazil Accepts!"
bbr.53.d:0 "Brazil has accepted our offer!"
bbr.53.a:0 "Excellent"

bbr.5300.t:0 "Brazil Declines"

bbr.5300.a:0 "Damn"

bbr.54.t:0 "Black Belt requests an alliance"
bbr.54.d:0 "The Black Republic under the Peace Party is requesting an alliance with us after they built positive relations with us through the International Peace Movement. Shall we accept?"

bbr.55.a:0 "Accept"
bbr.55.b:0 "Politely Decline"

bbr.5500.t:0 "NOI base destroyed"
bbr.5500.d:0 "As part of our attempts to disarm political extremists in our region a department agency in charge of enforcing the Firearms And Extremist Act called the Bureau of Domestic Peace came into a confrontation with a NOI cell in North Florida. The NOI group refused to surrender and instead fired upon the officers, resulting in a shootout that left 16 dead. Elijah Muhammad has denounced the 'attack' and called on other NOI cells to prepare for attacks. Privately, however, he claims he would be willing to help calm them if we stop interferring with their recruitment attempts, leaving the cabinet split on whether to accept or not."
bbr.5500.a:0 "Accept his deal"
bbr.5500.b:0 "Refuse his deal"

bbr.56.t:0 "Haywood's Fosterites Retreat"
bbr.56.d:0 "The Haywood lead TUUL has been in retreat after refusing to pay taxes and men to a 'capitalist imperialist government', and they began to encourage the population to revolt against us. With some of their cells being broken for holding illegal weapons, conspiracy or engaging in violent rhetoric they have found themselves in retreat with the numbers to back up their claims. As a result Haywood is denouncing our government more loudly than ever but remains a fringe figure while the TUUL is increasingly broken."
bbr.56.a:0 "Good"

bbr.57.t:0 "Settling on a name"
bbr.57.d:0 "So far we have simply been referred to as the Black Revolt in foreign nations, and even among ourselves we simply refer to our state as 'revolters'. Of course, this designation was always intended to be temporary, and with us settling on a Republic we should rename ourselves to a more proper title."
bbr.57.a:0 "The Black Republic"
bbr.57.b:0 "The Southern Republic"

bbr.2300.t:0 "Entente Alliance?"
bbr.2300.d:0 "Our trading initiatives with the Entente have proven to be very worthwhile. Businesses leaders and ministers within the Republican Party are beginning to push for a formal request to join the alliance, and [CAN.GetLeader] has assured us that our admission will be granted if we make the request. However, W.E.B. DuBois, A. Philip Randolph and other left-wing politicians in the government are objecting to an alliance, criticizing the actions of the French exiles in Africa, and claiming that joining the Entente will drag us into Canadian wars of imperialism which are irrelevant to our nation."
bbr.2300.a:0 "We shall join the Entente"

While some generals have fled into exile, the generals who were caught are now waiting for the verdict of the military tribunal. However, despite what the public believes, it's not as easy to carry out the trials as it was originally anticipated. Most trialed generals don't have any particular record of unnecessary violence, and even those that do can still claim they were following orders. Among them, the most controversial one so far is Dwight Eisenhower.
