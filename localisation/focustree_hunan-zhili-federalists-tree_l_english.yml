Now, with the recent instability in Hunan, and with the Zhili Clique's tacit backing, Tang Xiangming has now been chosen to succeed Wu Guangxin, and now, he promises a new era of Hunan, citing that he wants to create a more moral Hunan to be a model for China to follow. Despite his promises, questions has arose surrounding his true allegiance, considering his allegiance to Yuan Shikai that led to his bloody actions before, his Zhili connections, his own personal beliefs of Buddhism, but most notable is his membership in Zhang Junmai's party, the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party. Because of these conflicting allegiances, one can only guess what will be the Butcher's next move on his promises on the implementation of democracy and republicanism."

HNNZHILI_support_a_new_form_of_democracy_desc:0 "Our new governor Tang Xiangming has made his political position clear, that is to realize a Chinese democracy, forging the third way between Kuomintang radicalism and Zhili reactionarism. This doctrine, first devised by Zhang Junmai and his Democratic Socialists has been called "Chinese National Socialism", a populist doctrine based around a combination of deradicalized democratic socialism taking inspirations from the liberal socialist movements of Europe, elements of humanist neo-Confucianism from Junmai's early flirtations with Confucianism, and Buddhism under Socialist guidance, wished by certain progressive elements of our province, particularly of the Buddhist General Tang Zhengshi. With his own populist doctrine established, Tang now has to decide on a set direction that he would lead Hunan under, to unite the people of Hunan and later China to a new era of true democracy under his guidance."

Now Tang Xiangming has embraced this doctrine and looking into this new third way of governance, Xiangming has invited officials from Junmai's party in order to further expand on the effort in bringing Junmai's ideology to practice."

While our China is not yet ready for full democracy as long as it remained divided, which requires Marshal Tang's guidance in the meantime, we shall enshrine the people's rule within the province by setting up local democratically elected governance to give the people a voice to represent themselves. Hopefully it will hopefully bridge the gap between us and the people, and prepare our province, and China as a whole one day, of the creation of the first true Chinese democracy."

While we aren't strictly following Buddhism as a state philosophy, perhaps we can tolerate these efforts of studying the path of the Bodhisattva, for it has shown to bridge the gap between the people's conception of our socialist order, and creating a better people."

It is our duty to put an end to that worry for our people, as we will bring to them a just and lawful rule, social security and representation, to give the people peace both physically and mentally. Furthermore, it will help raise popularity of our rule to other provinces as well, which will make acceptance to our rule across China easier to accept."
