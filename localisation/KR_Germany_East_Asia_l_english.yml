### Focuses ###
GEA_mission1:0 "Status of the Admiralty"
GEA_mission1_desc:0 "With the annexation of the French Colonies and the incorporation of the British Territories, German East Asia is a colonial authority unique in its control by Grand Admiral Hellmuth von Mücke and the Ostasienflotte. We must review the status of our continuing mission to protect the colonies from outside aggressors and how best this can be achieved."
GEA_army1:0 "The Ostasien Force"
GEA_army1_desc:0 "The Ostasien Force is currently a divided mix between Ostasien marines, local garrison units and fresh recruits from Berlin. We must take stock and decide whether to focus more on recruiting locals or further strengthen our forces from the Fatherland."
GEA_military1:0 "Request Arms from Berlin"
GEA_military1_desc:0 "We still lack reasonable military-industrial facilities, leaving us reliant on Berlin for supplies. Until we have the opportunity to establish a domestic supply we should request additional rifles from the homeland."
GEA_military2:0 "Request Modern Artillery"
GEA_military2_desc:0 "Our existing artillery pieces are rusted relics from even before the Weltkrieg, to better protect our colonies we should request modern pieces from Berlin."
GEA_military3:0 "Request Further Arms Supplies"
GEA_military3_desc:0 "With tensions ramping up further within the region we must bolster our standing forces even more. We shall send a request to Berlin for further equipment."
GEA_germantroops1:0 "A German Force"
GEA_germantroops1_desc:0 "The natives aren't fit to defend and die for the Kaiser. We must continue relying on German Troops even if it reduces our total force size."
GEA_germantroops2:0 "Prussian Discipline"
GEA_germantroops2_desc:0 "Our army should embody the spririt of the warriors that won us the Weltkrieg, strict discipline and military honour of the highest order."
GEA_germantroops3:0 "Enlist the Military Police"
GEA_germantroops3_desc:0 "Currently our Military Police exists in a generally informal state with only small arms that they use on patrol. As we are in need of extra men we should seek to arm these MP units and incorporate them as auxilliaries."
GEA_germantroops4:0 "Request Prussian Guards from Berlin"
GEA_germantroops4_desc:0 "If we are to secure our colonies and protect them from fanatical aggressors then we need equally fanatical troops. We shall send a request to Berlin for a new shock trooper division to help us shore up our defences."
GEA_localtroops1:0 "Use the Locals"
GEA_localtroops1_desc:0 "While the natives will never match up to German force and Prussian discipline the simple fact is that there are more of them than us. Numbers win wars after all, not pagentary."
GEA_localtroops2:0 "Native Garrisons"
GEA_localtroops2_desc:0 "It is true we have a large native population, and while they might not fight and die like a German for us, they will fight and die for their own people. We should raise a series of Garrison divisions and station them within their own regions."
GEA_localtroops3:0 "Breach the Language Barrier"
GEA_localtroops3_desc:0 "Our Forces are plagued with communication issues due to the convoluted network of languages and translators within the armed service. We will solve this by devolving further powers to regimental officers on language and force compositions to negate these problems."
GEA_localtroops4:0 "Formal Rights for Service"
GEA_localtroops4_desc:0 "Our Colonial Subjects do not currently enjoy the same rights as a German citizen even if they serve within the armed forces. To attract more recruits this must change, and service should be honoured."
GEA_budget1:0 "Fiscal Austerity"
GEA_budget1_desc:0 "With the global financial crisis emanating from Berlin we must cut back on our spending and increase our revenue immediately or suffer an enormous budgetary deficit."
GEA_budget2:0 "A Colonial Mark"
GEA_budget2_desc:0 "Unlike our friends in Afrika, we have never made serious efforts to encourage use of the Ostasienmark since its introduction in 1927. By requiring its use we will increase uniformity across the colonies and improve our ability to collect revenue."
GEA_budget3:0 "Share our Burden"
GEA_budget3_desc:0 "Local European settlers have long benefited from our protection and have paid very little tax in exchange for the order they enjoy. But since we rely on their cooperation to run the colonies, and cannot go too far, it would be better to forge an agreement with them."
GEA_budget4:0 "Reinforce Colonial Bureaucracy"
GEA_budget4_desc:0 "German East Asia has never had a fully functional administration to implement its will. Now in the wake of colonial turmoil it's time to expand the bureaucracy and establish direct rule over our colonies."
GEA_budget5:0 "[GetNameGEAIndochina] Pacification"
GEA_budget5_desc:0 "[GetNameGEAIndochina], is a key part of the Deutsch-Ostasien administration and an economic centre. With the spectre of Vietcong insurgents looming it only stands to reason that it be pacified and fortified."
GEA_budget6:0 "Factories of Singapur"
GEA_budget6_desc:0 "[GetNameGEASingapore] is currently lacking any meaningful heavy industry. Certain German corporations are interested in making the jump to Asia but request our backing for their investments before they start. New factories will increase employment and stabilise the situation."
GEA_budget7:0 "Malaya Pacification"
GEA_budget7_desc:0 "Malaya is the shining jewel of German East-Asia and the operational centre of our entire administration, but in the wake of Black Monday it has been disturbed by violent insurgency. We should seek to introduce a system of posts, bunkers and bastions to pacify the local insurgents. This will also benefit us in the case of enemy land-based assault."
GEA_budget8:0 "[GetNameGEAIndochina] Investments"
GEA_budget8_desc:0 "The textile mills of [GetNameGEAIndochina] cry out for further funding to expand and innovate in new garment-making techniques. Providing this funding would endear us to the locals and bring in new revenue long-term. This will help the economic recovery and stabilisation of society."
GEA_budget9:0 "Local Arms Foundries"
GEA_budget9_desc:0 "The Current arms manufacturers within our area of jurisdiction are sorely lacking to say the least. We should invest in further developing new designs and facilities to lessen our reliance on Berlin's scraps."
GEA_budget10:0 "Protect Tsingtau"
GEA_budget10_desc:0 "Our troops fought and bled to the last men to defend Tsingtau during the Weltkrieg, these brave and stalwart men make up a large portion of Hellmuth's inner circle and they press him to better defend their object of desire."
GEA_budget11:0 "Authorise Local Arms Production"
GEA_budget11_desc:0 "Currently many of our treaties forbid the native authorities and princes from establishing arms production as a condition of our protection. With the reforms that have taken place to the basic structure of our government we have come to regard these restrictions as an outmoded hindrance and are keen to remove them."
GEA_budget12:0 "Siamese Border Fortifications"
GEA_budget12_desc:0 "While the Kingdom of Siam did assist the German Empire during the Weltkrieg they were not rewarded with their full territorial claims, on which we currently sit. We should fortify the border just in case they decide that weapons speak louder than words."
GEA_budget13:0 "Lessons from Mittelafrika"
GEA_budget13_desc:0 "Mittelafrika is our sister project of sorts, has been dealing with native discontent since it's inception. We are sure to benefit in hiring Mittelafrikanisch advisors"
GEA_budget14:0 "Fortress Hainan"
GEA_budget14_desc:0 "Hainan is an important staging post for operations in Southern China and along the Indochinese Coast. We should seek to fortify the island."
GEA_budget15:0 "Counter-Insurgency Lessons"
GEA_budget15_desc:0 "The Mittelafrikanisch colonial forces have extensive experience, hard and bloodily won, in defeating local rebels and insurgents. With a more permanent military attache be established, it has allowed for new doctrines and tactics to be employed. Though this has resulted in a higher failure rate in recruitment, the results speak for themselves."
GEA_budget16:0 "Deployment of the Flüssigkeitsbrandbombe"
GEA_budget16_desc:0 "Mittelafrikan terrain is filled with thick vegetation and jungles, because of this they have introduced a new weapon: the Flüssigkeitsbrandbombe 'the Liquid Fire Bomb', to bomb the insurgents in the dense foliage of Africa. Its use of White phosphorus is truly breathtaking, though its effect on the enemy has been seen as quite distasteful by the more traditional members of the Admiralty."
GEA_budget17:0 "Valkyries of the Battlefield"
GEA_budget17_desc:0 "Due to the poor infrastructure and rough terrain in which our troops operate we frequently have difficulty extracting wounded men, leading to deaths from wounds that would otherwise be treatable. The use of native strecher bearers has been a god send, who know the lay of the land. They have been dubbed "Valkyries" by the soldiers, as they lift those who will live and triage those who will die."
GEA_air1:0 "Singapur Flying Corps"
GEA_air1_desc:0 "Our current aerial forces are entirely comprised of our Naval Aviation detachment. We should seek to find and train additional pilots for a land based air force."
GEA_air2:0 "Weihaiwei Airbases"
GEA_air2_desc:0 "Weihaiwei, shared with the AOG, is the perfect position from which to project our aerial might across the entire region. In theory, we are able to strike Qing, Fengtian and even Japan, all from one base. We should now seek to expand it to facilitate these options."
GEA_air3:0 "Aerial Exercises"
GEA_air3_desc:0 "Our Pilots must be trained in the best conditions possible to suit our needs, we shall stage aerial wargames over Tsingtau to show our rivals that we mean business."
GEA_air4:0 "Focke-Wulf East Asian Subsidiary"
GEA_air4_desc:0 "Focke-Wulf have expressed interest in opening an East Asian Subsidiary to take advantage of our local labour and resources. We should fuly support them in this venture."
GEA_air5:0 "East Asian Fallschirmjäger"
GEA_air5_desc:0 "Grand Admiral von Mücke has long admired the Fallschimjäger and their strong discipline. Recently he has made contact with the "Wolf" Dietrich Witzel who has offered to train and command an elite division here in the East; an offer we cannot refuse."
GEA_air6:0 "Request Fighters from Berlin"
GEA_air6_desc:0 "While we are now producing some planes locally we still require more than we can currently produce. We shall request a quartet of fighters from Berlin to fill the gap in the meantime."
GEA_navy1:0 "The Grand Fleet"
GEA_navy1_desc:0 "The Ostasienflotte is the largest and grandest outside of Europe and forms the core of our operations in East Asia; a shining testament to our commitment to the present order. Our primary foe within the region is of course the Empire of Japan and their own considerable fleet. Keeping our grand fleet in port forces the Japanese to use significant naval assets to keep it on watch."
GEA_navy2:0 "The Ostasien Fleet in the 1934 Naval Plan"
GEA_navy2_desc:0 "East Asia, perhaps moreso than anywhere else, depends upon German naval power to protect her scattered islands and bases. Therefore while the majority of the Fatherland's resources are devoted to the extremely prestigious Hochseeflotte, the 1934 Naval Plan makes significant provisions for our navy's expansion."
GEA_fleet1:0 "The Fleet In Being"
GEA_fleet1_desc:0 "The present disposition of the Hochseeflotte is that through superior force and occasional, devastating sorties we will win command of the sea. By following them in this school of thought we can ensure that orthodox German naval doctrine is maintained across all fleets."
GEA_fleet_2:0 "Modern Destroyers"
GEA_fleet_2_desc:0 "Destroyers are the backbone of a modern navy. We should revamp and redesign our own to a higher standard."
GEA_battlecruiser1:0 "Command of the Sea"
GEA_battlecruiser1_desc:0 "The Ostasienflotte has only one future priority: to defeat the Japanese in the event of a war. This means that our doctrinal efforts should be focused to exploit their weaknesses. Japan relies heavily on imports from her puppets and posessions. Therefore, by aiming at trade disruption, we can deal an outsized blow."
GEA_battlecruiser2:0 "Colonial Battlecruisers"
GEA_battlecruiser2_desc:0 "While battleships and colossal dreadnoughts are the mainstay of the German navy, local East-Asian shipbuilding lacks the enormous dockyards and access to steel that mainland Germany has. Accordingly we intend to further the use of battlecruisers, a type of armoured cruiser with heavier arms but weaker armour that has largely fallen out of favour with the world's naval powers. They shall suit our needs perfectly."
GEA_strikegroup1:0 "Aviation School"
GEA_strikegroup1_desc:0 "While German doctrine holds that naval aviation's only purpose is in reconnaissance, the Grand Admiral is afforded a surprising degree of freedom over the disposition of his forces. To that end, if he so chooses, we could begin investing much more time into the school of thought that holds air power to be the future of naval power, though it would be sure to attract controversy in Berlin."
GEA_strikegroup2:0 "Light Cruisers"
GEA_strikegroup2_desc:0 "Lightly armoured cruisers, displacing less than 5000 tonnes, are quite frequently the key to building a mobile naval force; be that for raiding convoys bringing war material to Japan, or escorting carriers to project air power in the Pacific. They will form an able backbone."
GEA_strikegroup3:0 "Carrier Conversion"
GEA_strikegroup3_desc:0 "It may take some bribery and arouse controversy when Berlin learns, but to support our doctrinal divergence we should have some battlecruisers converted into flat-topped carriers in short order."
GEA_strikegroup4:0 "Naval Aviation Ambition"
GEA_strikegroup4_desc:0 "Whatever Berlin's thoughts on carriers may be, even they will not deny that planes have some utility in a naval context. Therefore we have been authorised to further develop land-based aircraft specialised for attacking ships and ports."
GEA_naval_air1:0 "Our Naval Aerial Corps"
GEA_naval_air1_desc:0 "The [GetNameGEASingapore] Flying Corps could do with an expanded remit, by forming a specialised naval division we can increase their operational breadth immensely."
GEA_naval_air2:0 "Reinforce Air-Defence"
GEA_naval_air2_desc:0 "The threat of aerial attacks on [GetNameGEASingapore] is a constant worry, with planes from mainland China, the Philippines and Australia now capable of reaching her. Investing in local anti-air defences will not only give us some peace of mind but also assure the locals of our commitment."
GEA_fleet3:0 "SMS Neckar"
GEA_fleet3_desc:0 "While the Ostasienflotte is already strong and mighty it never hurts to increase its size. We shall lay the keel of a new Battleship, the 'Neckar', that will serve as a strong and modern spearhead."
GEA_fleet4:0 "Underwater Fleet"
GEA_fleet4_desc:0 "The U-Boat should take a prominent role in our fleet, the better to counter Japanese surface-based power. By pushing for further development of submarine vessels we can extend our advantage over their vulnerable shipping lanes."
GEA_navy4:0 "Expand our Local Dockyards"
GEA_navy4_desc:0 "While we will never be able to build a Battleship or Carrier with our local resources, destroyers and cruisers are not impossible. We should expand the local dockyard facilities to see this become a reality."
GEA_navy3:0 "Expand Naval Facilities"
GEA_navy3_desc:0 "At present, the current naval facilities in Sembawang and Cam Ranh can only support the coastal patrol elements stationed in the area. We should expand these naval bases so that they can better handle large capital ships, and support our growing presence."
GEA_navy5:0 "Ostasien Merchant Navy"
GEA_navy5_desc:0 "One of the biggest benefits to the Ostasien colonies, and one of the reasons the Fatherland maintains them, is the sheer volume of trade it gives us control over. By pressing some of the extensive merchant fleet into service to carry war material we can gain a temporary boost to our carrying capacity."
GEA_navy6:0 "New Shipbuilding Methods"
GEA_navy6_desc:0 "Shipbuilding has moved on in the years since the 1934 plan. Now by embracing the latest methods of steel milling, hull construction, and electronics, we can build newer more modern ships much faster."
GEA_navy7:0 "Rule the Pacific"
GEA_navy7_desc:0 "Germania rules the waves! From the Atlantic to the Pacific we shall dominate the seas, and the Ostasienflotte shall have pride of place as queen of the world's largest ocean."
GEA_navyfort1:0 "Coastal Fortifications Program"
GEA_navyfort1_desc:0 "Currently [GetNameGEASingapore] appears to be vulnerable to amphibious landings. With the Japanese expanding their marine forces we should expand our defences to match and counter them."
GEA_navyfort2:0 "Anti-Invasion Plan"
GEA_navyfort2_desc:0 "By conducting wargames, creating a reserve of concrete and steel and training the civilian population in evacuation methods, we can ensure that any invasion scenario is met with full force."
GEA_navyfort3:0 "Absolute Defence Sphere"
GEA_navyfort3_desc:0 "The doctrine of a "Gesamtschutzsphäre" is an extreme elaboration on our focus on defending the colonies from invasion. It calls for the establishment of multiple different failsafes and backup plans to prepare for every possible scenario of invasion and naval landing, and to relentlessly drill the troops so that they are prepared for every single one."
GEA_navyfort4:0 "Saigon Coastal Fortifications"
GEA_navyfort4_desc:0 "Saigon is the gateway to Vietnam and Indochina proper, and as such as we should seek to fortify the city from amphibious assaults."
GEA_marine1:0 "The Ostasien Marines"
GEA_marine1_desc:0 "With our unique situation on the globe we naturally focus more on Marines than other nearby nations, with the Ostasien Marines in particular being known for their hard and fast amphibious assaults. We should provide further training to ensure they are at the cutting edge."
GEA_marine2:0 "Expand the [GetNameGEASingapore] Detachment"
GEA_marine2_desc:0 "While our marines are fierce and hardy, they are limited in number. We should seek to expand the size of our Marine forces."
GEA_marine3:0 "Jungle Warfare"
GEA_marine3_desc:0 "The harsh jungles of Indochina have long been a graveyard of empires, friend and foe alike. We must train all our troops to better operate in such hostile conditions."
GEA_internal1:0 "Collaborate with Local Elites"
GEA_internal1_desc:0 "Our internal governance is both byzantine and archaic due to the inheritance of both French and British Colonial systems in addition to our directly administered territories. We have decided facilitate closer collaboration with local elites to try and improve the situation."
GEA_internal2:0 "Strengthen our Ties"
GEA_internal2_desc:0 "Grand Admiral von Mücke himself will conduct the important talks with our local partners, his stated approach of charm and champagne might not work as well as he hopes but we will do our best to support the meetings"
GEA_internal3:0 "Help Small Businesses"
GEA_internal3_desc:0 "We can help set the economy back on course by supporting local businesses over large German corporations. This will ensure prosperity and employment for the natives, and help disuade them from participating in rebellion."
GEA_internal4:0 "New Admiralty"
GEA_internal4_desc:0 "A reassessment of the role of the admiralty has begun in the German East Asia, as it slowly develops into a proper administration rather than a fleet with territories."
GEA_johor1:0 "The Malaya Solution"
GEA_johor1_desc:0 "The Sultan of Johor was and still is a key figure in the Malayan Sultanates accepting our rule so easily. He now asks for further concessions to right the wrongs of the previous British administration, and we agree that these can be amended."
GEA_johor2:0 "Collaboration with Local Monopolisers"
GEA_johor2_desc:0 "The best way to get ourselves out of the Black Monday slump is to support the economy back home and revive our exports. To this end we should support large German businesses in penetrating the region economically, in order to gain access to cheap raw materials."
GEA_johor3:0 "Local Economic Initiative"
GEA_johor3_desc:0 "Ruolph Firle, a high-ranking employee of Norddeutscher Lloyd, has approached us with a comprehensive plan to sponsor local trade and shipping. This would serve to support the economy of South East Asia in the long term by making it less dependent on exporting raw materials."
GEA_bao1:0 "The Bao Dai Solution"
GEA_bao1_desc:0 "When we took posession of the French Territories after the Weltkrieg it was decided that Emperor Bao Dai would remain in his position as the Emperor of Annam under our 'guiding hand'. He now requests a series of reforms to revitalise the ancient imperial system. We shall see if we can grant him these."
GEA_bao2:0 "German Advisory Group"
GEA_bao2_desc:0 "By creating a permanent military attache system for the local forces we can not only help smooth the process of integrating them into our own army, but keep an eye on radical elements that might infiltrate them."
GEA_bao3:0 "Deploy Local Guards"
GEA_bao3_desc:0 "Many local princes have a common request: expansion of their personal military forces. By allowing this on the condition that each raise a German-speaking regiment of elite royal guards we can benefit our regular forces as well as fulfilling their demands."
GEA_vong1:0 "Drinks with King Sisavang"
GEA_vong1_desc:0 "While King Sisavang might be one of smaller autonomous dependents he is still influential, like others he has requested certain colonial wrongs be righted. This we shall do to a certain extent."
GEA_vong2:0 "Education Reform"
GEA_vong2_desc:0 "The literacy rate of the native population is, presently, best described as abysmal. By promoting education in German by bilingual locals we can attempt to remedy some of this issue."
GEA_vong3:0 "Research Institutes"
GEA_vong3_desc:0 "Sponsoring a pair of European-style universities in [GetNameGEASingapore] and Saigon will allow us to broaden our research base, as well as allowing richer and more educated natives to study here rather than going abroad, where they may become radicalised."
GEA_railway3:0 "Ostasien Infrastructral Plan"
GEA_railway3_desc:0 "By formulating a comprehensive plan for local railroads as well as a new highway network between cities we can overhaul the local infrastructure and improve our otherwise lacking transport links."
GEA_railway2:0 "Tonkin Gulf Steel Factories"
GEA_railway2_desc:0 "The difficulties in construction of infrastructure have highlighted our lack of a steel industry. Developing Thach Khe Iron Mine has long been an ambition of our industrial planners, combined with the development of coal mines in North Vietnam we can now start a pan-Tonkin steel production project."
GEA_railway:0 "The Transindochinese Railways"
GEA_railway_desc:0 "With our last series of investments and new rolling stock we have managed to finish the connecting route to Tonkin. This should help improve our internal trade and travel."
GEA_develop_tsingtau:0 "Develop Tsingtau"
GEA_develop_tsingtau_desc:0 "Tsingtau is more than a city, it is a symbol of German dominance, control, and more than anything else, it is our place in the sun. To lose tsingtau would be unthinkable to high command, and all efforts must be made to fortify the concession."
GEA_fortify_concessions:0 "Fortify the Concessions"
GEA_fortify_concessions_desc:0 "The situation in China is looking grim. Nationalist elements are disrupting our carefully constructed peace, and Japanese forces are merely waiting for a sign of weakness. Securing our hold on our current concessions from hostile forces, both within and without, is a primary concern."
GEA_kill_yunnan:0 "Punish Yunnan"
GEA_kill_yunnan_desc:0 "The lucrative tin trade we had with Yunnan has been ended by those scoundrels. It is time to show them the might of the Heer and forcefully resume our friendly business relations."
GEA_become_pals_with_qing:0 "Resume Sino-German Cooperation"
GEA_become_pals_with_qing_desc:0 "Berlin's orders are clear: setting aside matters of civilisation and race, Germany and China must meet one another with arms outstretched in mutual strength and friendship, faced by a mutual foe.\n\nIn truth, Germany needs Chinese soldiers as a buffer against Japan, and China needs German guns to arm them."

GEA_attack_lec:0 "Secure the Legation Cities"

# Introduction event
Ostasien.0.t:0 "Pearl of the Orient"
Ostasien.0.d:0 "Ever since the British collapse in 1926, the Kaiserliche Marine has been the undisputed master of the Eastern Seas, and the guardian of the western order in the Orient. The retreat of the British 'China Station' to Australasia left her Asian colonies and concessions vulnerable to native socialist insurrection, and in need of protection only Germany could offer, completing a string of colonies and concessions from Suez to Tsingtau. This glorious achievement came at a cost, however.\n\nOur expansion in the East was unusual in its rapidity and scale, bringing our jurisdiction over a diverse and complicated series of colonies divorced from their metropole; forced to acknowlege our superiority and yet all too byzantine to reconstruct or totally reorder, lest they collapse and bring our administration with them. Thus, German East Asia exists not as a colony, or even formally as an authority, but instead as a jurisdiction; a stretch of territory in which the relatively impartial admiralty must at once balance local interests, contend with varying colonial systems, and ensure the protection of it all.\n\nDespite our dominance, Japan remains a threat, determined as ever to push us out of the East and claim it for itself; our brave soldiers staring theirs down over the Legation Cities, and our glorious battleships vigilant across the seas.\n\nLooking past matters of internal difficulty, there may yet be a reckoning and it is the Admiralty's duty to ensure that when the time comes, it is ready."
Ostasien.0.a:0 "Sehr Gut!"
Ostasien.0.b:0 "What about China?"

Ostasien.1.t:0 "China and the AOG"
Ostasien.1.d:0 "The Fatherland's Chinese possessions also lie under our jurisdiction, and as per the terms of the American-mediated Shanghai Conference of 1928, Germany's rights in China are equal to those of any other foreign power. The city of Tsingtau has long served as the nexus of our operations there, at once a modern city, a thriving port, and the center of an extensive commerical web woven throughout the East.\n\nNot everything passing through Kiaochow Bay is fully legitimate, however. The Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, or Supervisory Board of the East Asian General Administration, manages numerous ships, factories, and even informal concessions which violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the 1928 agreement.\n\nThe Nanjing Warlord Sun Chuanfang, in a bid to ensure his autonomy from China's central government, accepted a series of exploitative arms deals in return for extensive economic concessions within the League of Eight Provinces. Although unrecognized by Beijing, as well as the rest of the international community, the AOG spreads its influence throughout the League and ever deeper into the country's interior.\n\nUltimately Berlin would like us to use China as a buffer of sorts against Japan; every soldier spent there is one who cannot be deployed against us in Malaya and Indochina. To that end, China's government and the LEP must be supported, and Japanese encroachment in China must be considered only one step away from [GetNameGEASingapore]."
Ostasien.1.a:0 "Sehr Gut!"

# Black Monday
Ostasien.2.t:0 "Black Monday!"
Ostasien.2.d:0 "The situation in Germany is dire. After a devastating financial crisis, the German economy is in tatters, and the colonies are sure to follow. We must cut back on much of our spending and immediately look for ways to buttress East Asia's already weakening economy. Recovery could take many years..."
Ostasien.2.a:0 "Disastrous!"

Ostasien.3.t:0 "The End of the Black Week"
Ostasien.3.d:0 "A week has passed since the initial Berlin Stock Market Crash. Rubber and tin, our main export commodities, have already lost more than half of their pre-Black Monday value due to the collapse of tire demand from the automotive industry. Meanwhile, rice exports to the European market have ground to a halt, leaving tens of thousands of tons rotting in the fields and on the docks. Europeans in Singapore, Saigon, and other cities with few savings and no land ownership gambled and lost everything on the market, and now find themselves little better off than their Indochinese neighbours."
Ostasien.3.a:0 "Something must be done!"

### Uprising Chain ###
# Yen Bai Muytiny
Ostasien.4.t:0 "Instability in Indochina"
Ostasien.4.d:0 "Since our expeditionary army destroyed Ho Chi Minh and his syndicalist agitators in Guangzhou ten years ago, Indochina has enjoyed a relatively stable period. But the recent Berlin Stock Market Crash, or Black Monday, has had a devastating impact on the highly commercialised Indochinese economy. Strikes and rice riots are spreading in Tonkin, Annam and Cochinchina. Urban students and intellectuals ask for more freedom. What's worse, our intelligence suggests some underground revolutionaries are secretly spreading their influence."
Ostasien.4.a:0 "This colony is notorious for insubordination."

Ostasien.5.t:0 "Nationalist Agitation in Tonkin"
Ostasien.5.d:0 "We have uncovered a series of nationalist and anti-colonialist movements in Tonkin. In every corner of Hanoi agitators are disseminating pamphlets calling for national unity and independence. The ringleader behind the agitations is a group called the Vietnamese Nationalist Party(VNQDD), and our agents have discovered an insidious plan: these bandits are infiltrating our garrison in Tonkin."
Ostasien.5.a:0 "We must prepare."

Ostasien.6.t:0 "Yen-Bai Mutiny"
Ostasien.6.d:0 "Today some Tonkinese garrisons in Yen-Bai, a military post near the Sino-Indochinese border, organised a mutiny against the colonial officials! Along with them are armed infiltrators of VNQDD. Thanks to our agents, we sabotaged their plan to launch a coordinated uprising. We have fended off the rebels and begun a large-scale crackdown in Tonkin. Now the desperate rebels are fleeing to the mountainous area on the Sino-Vietnamese border."
Ostasien.6.a:0 "Concentrate our force to crush these bandits!"
Ostasien.6.b:0 "Declare martial law in all Indochina!"

Ostasien.7.t:0 "An Indochinese Tragedy" # FRA
Ostasien.7.d:0 ""Viet-Nam! Viet-Nam! Viet-Nam! Homeland of the South! Thirteen times, I heard the outcry in front of the guillotine of Yen-Bai. Thirteen men sentenced to death shouted it, one by one, two metres away from climbing the scaffold."\n\n— A French journalist Louis Roubaud witnessed the recent brutal German crackdown in Indochina, our former colony and the current bastion of German colonialism in the Far East. Now General Jacques Doriot, a close friend of the late Indochinese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh spoke for an intervention in Indochina. Since the end of the Weltkrieg, thousands of Indochinese students, soldiers and workers have stayed in France and become firm revolutionaries. If we send them back with sufficient arms, they can organise an uprising in Cochinchina. This could destabilise the German colonial empire and serve the world revolution."
Ostasien.7.a:0 "Bon voyage, Indochinese comrades!"
Ostasien.7.b:0 "We are not the modern Pigneau de Behaine."

Ostasien.8.t:0 "An Indochinese Tragedy" # BHC
Ostasien.8.d:0 ""Viet Nam! Viet Nam! Viet Nam! Homeland of the South! Thirteen times, I heard the outcry in front of the guillotine of Yen-Bai. Thirteen men sentenced to death shouted it, one by one, two metres away from climbing the scaffold."\n\n— A French journalist Louis Roubaud witnessed the recent brutal German crackdown in Indochina, the bastion of German colonialism in the Far East. Now the Indochinese revolutionaries in Calcutta are lobbying for assistance. If we send equipment and volunteers, with German police and gendarmes occupied in Tonkin, the Indochinese revolutionaries can organise an uprising in Cochinchina. This could destabilise the German colonial empire. This will be an important step in our international revolution project."
Ostasien.8.a:0 "Send our help."
Ostasien.8.b:0 "We are not interested."

# Bao Dai Reform
Ostasien.9.t:0 "Emperor Bao Dai returns to Indochina"
Ostasien.9.d:0 "Bao Dai, the monarch of Annam, has recently finished his studies in Germany and returned to Indochina. Unfortunately he is not satisfied with a mere ceremonious role, but a carefully controlled monarchy would allow us to mitigate rural instability and win over the support of the people, since Annamese peasants are innately attached to their Emperor. However, the European settlers in Saigon staunchly oppose any attempt to share power with the Annamese."
Ostasien.9.a:0 "Welcome, our puppet emperor."
Ostasien.9.b:0 "Maybe he should continue his studies."

Ostasien.10.t:0 "Bao Dai's Reforms: The First Step"
Ostasien.10.d:0 "Having ascended to the throne, Bao Dai has recruited several reform-minded figures into his court, including Neo-traditionalist intellectual Pham Quyhn and Catholic administrator Ngo Dinh Diem. Now his ministers have decided to initiate an administrative reform to revitalise the dysfunctional bureaucratic system. Currently the mandarins in the protectorate of Annam only nominally run the country, while their European advisers hold true power. Bao Dai's reform will certainly damage the European monopolisation of power."
Ostasien.10.a:0 "It is necessary."
Ostasien.10.b:0 "Stop him. He has gone too far."

Ostasien.11.t:0 "Bao Dai's Reforms: The Second Step"
Ostasien.11.d:0 "After the administrative reform, Bao Dai's cabinet has begun to further centralise power. The recent turmoil in Indochina offers him a good excuse. He implores us to grant him authority to set up an imperial police force. Bao Dai and his ministers argue that only imperial police carrying order from the imperial court in Hue can effectively pacify the disobedient peasants and restore order in Annam."
Ostasien.11.a:0 "It will help."
Ostasien.11.b:0 "Giving the Annamese power is dangerous."

# Revolution in Cochinchina

Ostasien.12.t:0 "Instability in Cochinchina"
Ostasien.12.d:0 "With our forces occupied suppressing the nationalists in Tonkin, the situation to the south in Cochinchina is growing increasingly unstable. Strikes have decreased but trade union activists are reported to be holding frequent meetings, and rumors are spreading that agitators, disguised as monks and merchants, are organising peasants into secret societies in Cochinchina and southern Annam. Additional Intelligence suggests many Vietnamese exiles are illegally crossing the border and entering Indochina. They are likely to be sent by foreign powers to engage in subversive activities. Our officials have invented a new term: "Vietcong", in full Viet Nam Cong Doan (Vietnamese Syndicalist), to designate these red threats."
Ostasien.12.a:0 "I sense the calm before the storm."

Ostasien.13.t:0 "Jailbreak at Poulo Condor"
Ostasien.13.d:0 "This morning our central prison on Poulo Condor island reported a mass jailbreak! This was clearly a well-organised action; the prisoners escaped through a tunnel under cover of midnight, then embarked on pre-prepared junks and disappeared into the canal networks and marshes of the Mekong Delta. It's estimated that some 150 out of the total 25,000 prisoners escaped. Most are left-wing agitators."
Ostasien.13.a:0 "This colony has been nothing but trouble!"

Ostasien.14.t:0 "Binh Dinh Commune movement"
Ostasien.14.d:0 "Binh Dinh province, the home of Tay Son rebellion, is witnessing a dramatic escalation of its peasant movement. Demonstrators initially demanded an end to corvée labour, an equivalent to serfdom, but when they were ignored by local administrators angry peasants began to burn down administrative buildings, town halls and railway stations; destroy tax registers, and pillage police stations. The local administration has been paralysed and associations called "communes" have been formed, and the movement has begun to spread to other provinces in southern Annam and Mekong. Clearly the Vietcong are behind all these movements!"
Ostasien.14.a:0 "Perhaps we can deal with this peacefully."
Ostasien.14.b:0 "Send in the troops!"

Ostasien.15.t:0 "Saigon Uprising"
Ostasien.15.d:0 "Yesterday concerted insurgencies simultaneously broke out from Tonkin to Cochinchina. Trade Unions went into general strike and tried to occupy municipal government buildings. While in most places order has been restored, the Vietcong brought their peasant rebellion from Binh Dinh and Mekong to Saigon and entered the city. Local garrisons defected and rebels seized control of key communications and administrative facilities in Saigon!"
Ostasien.15.a:0 "Vive la Revolution! (Switch to INC)"
Ostasien.15.b:0 "Damn the Vietcong!"

Ostasien.16.t:0 "Situation in Indochina deteriorates"
Ostasien.16.d:0 "The situation in Indochina has deteriorated, with the insurgents being much harder than we thought to pacify. Vietcong regular forces are pushing northward while their guerrilla units harass our logistics and spread fear. Many settlers doubt if we can hold Indochina anymore and demand an evacuation of valuable assets to other colonies."
Ostasien.16.a:0 "Evacuate assets!"
Ostasien.16.b:0 "Everything is alright!"

Ostasien.17.t:0 "Situation in Indochina deteriorates"
Ostasien.17.d:0 "It seems that, although official reports from our far eastern colonies claim significant successes in suppressing the insurgency, according to military intelligence the situation in Indochina has actually deteriorated. Pacifying the Vietcong rebels seems to have been more than the admiralty could handle. Some major cities and strategic positions have fallen into rebel hands; fear and turmoil are spreading. Maybe German East Asia needs some help?"
Ostasien.17.a:0 "They can handle this."
Ostasien.17.b:0 "Send reinforcements!"
Ostasien.17.c:0 "A land war in Asia? Tally ho!"

Ostasien.18.t:0 "Indochinese Union sends Peace Initiative"
Ostasien.18.d:0 "The uprisings in Indochina have worsened. Key positions have fallen to Vietcong bandits and we are struggling to cope. Now Indochinese rebels send us an initiative of peace talk. Despite concerns that this will be considered as a humiliation, a wise move might be to give up control of the region."
Ostasien.18.a:0 "No, we will keep fighting these rebels!"
Ostasien.18.b:0 "We can't afford fighting anymore."

Ostasien.19.t:0 "Peace talk failed"
Ostasien.19.d:0 "German imperialists refused our peace initiative and decided to continue the war."
Ostasien.19.a:0 "Only guns can talk to the imperialists!"

Ostasien.20.t:0 "Victory in Indochina"
Ostasien.20.d:0 "Germany accepted the peace initiative and retreat from the Indochinese peninsula. We have fulfilled the mission of forcing German imperialists to withdraw. Indochina is now liberated from the German colonial regime! This is a great victory for our people and a major defeat for the German Imperialists and their lackeys."
Ostasien.20.a:0 "Pickelhaube go home!"

Ostasien.21.t:0 "Good News, Bad News"
Ostasien.21.d:0 "It seems that Berlin is concerned with the situation in Indochina. The bad news is, they discovered the fact that we are not doing well and harshly criticised us. The good news is, they've sent reinforcements to suppress Vietcong insurgents."
Ostasien.21.a:0 "Good News."

Ostasien.22.t:0 "Victory in Indochina"
Ostasien.22.d:0 "Our glorious army has managed to thwart the Vietcong revolt in Indochina! This is a glorious day for Germany!"
Ostasien.22.a:0 "Sehr gut, Kameraden!"

Ostasien.23.t:0 "Eascalation of war in Indochina"
Ostasien.23.d:0 "With German Empire committing its main force to Indochinese peninsula, the resistance war has escalated to an unprecedented level! But we will triumph, for the just cause of liberation is invincible. It's also rumoured that other great powers are trying to transform Indochinese peninsula into a quagmire for Germany..."
Ostasien.23.a:0 "Fight!"

Ostasien.25.t:0 "Bao Dai Solution" # Extra
Ostasien.25.d:0 "With Cochinchina fallen to the Vietcong and guerrillas rising everywhere, the whole of Indochina is in a state of emergency. Local elites and anti-syndicalist nationalists have rallied behind Emperor Bao Dai and propose a solution: If we honour the protectorate treaty, which means granting Nguyen Dynasty greater autonomy in Annam as well as Tonkin, they will help to pacify the rural areas, mobilise local resources and defeat the rebels. Otherwise, the prevalent anti-colonialist sentiment will give the Vietcong an edge. Bao Dai's missive ends ominously, stating that if Germany doesn't respond to Vietnamese nationalism, 'Every village will be a nest of resistance, each former collaborator an enemy, and your officials and colonists will themselves seek to leave this atmosphere, which will choke them.'"
Ostasien.25.b:0 "We can handle it ourselves."
Ostasien.25.a:0 "We need his help."
#Ostasien.16.c: "Bao Dai will lead Annam to peace and order (Release & switch to VIE)"

Ostasien.30.t:0 "Falling Prices"
Ostasien.30.d:0 "The prices of rice and rubber are rapidly falling across the colonies. The farmers and plantation owners, relying on rice and rubber exports, have been hit hard, especially in our two major colonies of Indochina and Malaya. It's possible to control the price in one colony, but our resources are limited, and this will almost certainly come at the cost of the other?"
Ostasien.30.a:0 "This is not our business."
Ostasien.30.b:0 "Protect Indochina."
Ostasien.30.c:0 "Protect Malaya."

Ostasien.32.t:0 "Plantation Strikes"
Ostasien.32.d:0 "The price of rubber keeps falling. Many plantation owners have decided to fire workers and keep the rest working full time. These decisions have triggered large-scale strikes in plantations in Indochina and Malaya. Workers are demanding employers stop firing employees, and they call for shorter working hours with better conditions. Since most plantation workers are illiterate, it's suspected that socialist agitators are behind their coordination."
Ostasien.32.a:0 "Suppress the strikes."
Ostasien.32.b:0 "Try to negotiate with them."

Ostasien.31.t:0 "European privileges"
Ostasien.31.d:0 "With the shock of Black Monday, many European settlers have lost everything and become impoverished overnight. Now some have petitioned us to strengthen their social and commercial privileges so that, as settlers, they will not be reduced to living like mere colonial subjects. They argue that a strict racial caste system is the only way to ensure the peace in our colonies."
Ostasien.31.a:0 "Reject Them."
Ostasien.31.b:0 "Reinforce European Privilege."

Ostasien.33.t:0 "The Binh Dinh commune movement is pacified"
Ostasien.33.d:0 "The peasant rebellion in Binh Dinh province has been pacified by our soldiers. Bombers and naval gunfire have proven especially effective in intimidating Vietnamese farmers. Binh Dinh, in Vietnamese, means pacification, and now it has really lived up to its name."
Ostasien.33.a:0 "Excellent!"

Ostasien.34.t:0 "Agitation dies down in Saigon"
Ostasien.34.d:0 "The sound of rain falling on the deserted square is deafening. A tattered pamphlet, thrown in the gutter -- the ink running out across the paper in soft blueish blooms -- is the only thing that still serves as proof that Saigon was, up until just recently, a hotbed of radical socialist and syndicalist agitation. Depicted on the pamphlet is a Vietnamese worker holding a socialist red flag. The pamphlet reads: 'Workers of Indochina, unite!'. It is soon swept away by the rain and down into the sewers whence it came."
Ostasien.34.a:0 "Good News."

Ostasien.35.t:0 "Rule of War"
Ostasien.35.d:0 "Vietcong doesn't respect the modern rule of war. Their guerrilla fighters not only refuse to wear uniforms, they often do their best to blend in with the civilian population. It's almost impossible to tell a Vietcong insurgent from civilian population. Our generals argue that the war against Vietcong can only be total."
Ostasien.35.b:0 "At least try to differentiate..."
Ostasien.35.a:0 "Shot everything that moves!"

Ostasien.40.t:0 "Acquire Mittelafrikanisch Advisors"
Ostasien.40.d:0 "Mittelafrika is our sister project of sorts, we both defend the Kaiserreich from its outside enemies and insubordinate subjects so it is only reasonable for us to strengthen our ties. The Grand Admiral has decided to hire Mittelafrikanisch advisors in hopes they will benefit our fighting forces and strenghten our anti counter-insurgency efforts"
Ostasien.40.a:0 "I wonder if their cannibals are worst then ours?"

Ostasien.41.t:0 "A Military Delegation from Mittelafrika"
Ostasien.41.d:0 "Admiral von Mücke and a delegation welcomed the Mittelafrikanisch as the disembarked from of their boat in [GetNameGEASingapore]. They appeared to be the men the Admiralty were looking with their rough and grizzled appearance inspiring confidence. They spoke few words before being escorted to their local accommodations, to the amusement of the locals as the appearence of several Askari has caused quite a stir."
Ostasien.41.a:0 "Mein Gott, he could wrestle a bull."

Ostasien.42.t:0 "Learning from Mittelafrika"
Ostasien.42.d:0 "Our military delegation has returned from Mittelafrika. Despite some flaws in local administration observed, our delegation reported that they were warmly hosted in Mittelafrika and learned a lot from them."
Ostasien.42.a:0 "Excellent!"

Ostasien.51.t:0 "A New Admiralty"
Ostasien.51.d.a:0 "After reassessing the status of the admiralty, we have decided that German East Asia must be changed into a fully functional colony. We will focus on building an administration to establish direct rule from Singapore!"
Ostasien.51.d.b:0 "After reassessing the status of the admiralty, we have decided that German East Asia is, above all, a branch of the Kaiserliche Marine. We will focus on naval construction and leave the administration to the natives."
Ostasien.51.a:0 "Great!"
Ostasien.51.b:0 "Great!"

Ostasien.52.t:0 "New Ships Arrive"
Ostasien.52.d:0 "New ships built in the 1934 Naval Plan have joined the glorious Ostasien fleet in [GetNameGEASingapore]."
Ostasien.52.a:0 "Excellent!"

# GEA Action in the Philippines

Ostasien.60.t:0 "Socialist rebellion in the Philippines"
Ostasien.60.d:0 "With the end of American colonial rule in the Philippines, the archipelago fell into chaos. A group of disgruntled army officers along with bands of peasants and industrial workers have revolted to overthrow the government and establish a socialist regime. It remains to be seen if the Philippine military forces can suppress the rebels, but some help will certainly increase their chance of winning."
Ostasien.60.a:0 "Secretly support the Philippine army."
Ostasien.60.b:0 "Not our business."

Ostasien.61.t:0 "Socialists seize power in the Philippines!"
Ostasien.61.d:0 "The Philippine government had signed power over to the Syndicalist movement. However, the southern parts of Philippines, including Palawan and Mindanao islands, are not under firm control of the new central government. Could this be our chance to free them from syndicalist tyranny and bring them under the imperial protection?"
Ostasien.61.a:0 "Send a fleet to secure the southern islands."
Ostasien.61.b:0 "Leave them be."

Ostasien.62.t:0 "A German fleet off Palawan!"
Ostasien.62.d:0 "Germany has placed the population of the southern regions under their "protection" and sent a fleet to secure the area. How should we react?"
Ostasien.62.a:0 "We will die heorically."
Ostasien.62.b:0 "We can't do anything."

Ostasien.63.t:0 "The Philippine government folds"
Ostasien.63.d:0 "The Philippine government has refused to confront us. Now the southern islands of the Philippines can be added to the Ostasien colonies, a glorious day for the Kaiserreich."
Ostasien.63.a:0 "Excellent."

Ostasien.64.t:0 "Ostasien fleet secures the southern Philippines"
Ostasien.64.d:0 "Today Admiral von Mücke reported from [GetNameGEASingapore] that the Ostasien fleet has successfully secured the southern islands of the Philippines against the syndicalist regime in Manila. A glorious day for the Kaiserreich."
Ostasien.64.a:0 "Excellent!"

Ostasien.65.t:0 "The Philippines declares war against us"
Ostasien.65.d:0 "Following the establishment of syndicalist government in Manila, the Ostasien fleet boldly attempted to secure the southern islands of the Philippines. Now the syndicalist government in Philippines has suicidally decided to declare war against us."
Ostasien.65.a:0 "Well done."

# GEA Intervention in Burma

Ostasien.66.t:0 "Social Unrest in Burma"
Ostasien.66.d:0 "The Kingdom of Burma, which gained its independence with the help of the German Empire, is facing a deep political crisis. Students and workers have risen up against the monarchy in critical demonstrations and protests. Police units have in so far been completely unsuccessful in containing the radical protesters. Should we try to support the Burmese monarchy in the crisis?"
Ostasien.66.a:0 "Send the fleet to show our support."
Ostasien.66.b:0 "Not our business."

Ostasien.67.t:0 "German fleet arrives at Yangon"
Ostasien.67.d:0 "Today a massive German fleet arrived at Yangon. The German naval delegation came to show their support to Burmese monarchy. The dissenters have been shocked and deterred by the powerful German fleet."
Ostasien.67.a:0 "Mighty Germany!"

Ostasien.68.t:0 "Order restored in Burma"
Ostasien.68.d:0 "Burma, a young kingdom recently facing a deep political crisis, has restored order thanks to the swift and resolute action of the Ostasien fleet. The Burmese ambassador acknowledged their appreciation for the German Empire and admiral Hellmuth Mücke. Now they seek closer relations with the German empire to protect their independence and stability."
Ostasien.68.a:0 "Guarantee their independence."
Ostasien.68.b:0 "But I don't know anything about Burma!"

#GEA natural disaster

Ostasien.69.t:0 "The Vulcan and Kaia volcanoes erupt!"
Ostasien.69.d:0 "Today the city of Rabaul was hit by two massive volcanic eruptions. Despite our best efforts, hundreds of citizens weren't able to flee in time and were buried beneath the ashes. Sacred Heart missionaries observed the explosive eruptions and were quick to set up an evacuation camp at their mission headquarters in Herbertshöhe. Several thousand injured and homeless people are now waiting for the colonial administration to send aid after this catastrophe."
Ostasien.69.a:0 "We need to hurry"

# Dissolution of the GEA

#Ostasien.69.t:0 "Berlin goes quiet"
#Ostasien.69.d:0 "We've now lost all contact with our colonial office in Berlin, not knowing of what to do next. Meanwhile the natives start to gather outside the Government Office, demanding independence. The atmostphere is tense like it never has been before before."
#Ostasien.69.a:0 "An uncertain future awaits us."

Ostasien.200.t:0 "Reinforcements to East Asia"
Ostasien.200.d:0 "The Reichskolonialamt has requested more men to be sent to the operations in East Asia, to relieve the ailing troops there. Even if these men could have had an easier time serving back home, East Asia is a hotbed of syndicalism and strife between the various factions that we have favourable agreements with."
Ostasien.200.a:0 "Such are the costs of an Empire."
Ostasien.201.t:0 "Equipment Shipments to East Asia"
Ostasien.201.d:0 "The Reichskolonialamt has requested more guns to be sent to the operations in East Asia, to reduce the shortage and ensure all divisions are at full specifications. These rifles will find themselves useful in gunning down the Orientals who dare go against the Kaiserreich."
Ostasien.201.a:0 "Such are the costs of an Empire."
Ostasien.202.t:0 "Germany is Offering Us Armaments"
Ostasien.202.d:0 "The German East Asian Government on behalf of Germany has recognised our dire situation and has offered a generous shipment of infantry equipment to help in our fight for survival. However, this kindness is certainly hiding a desire for an even stronger hold on our economy once the war ends."
Ostasien.202.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
Ostasien.202.b:0 "We must assert our independence!"
Ostasien.203.t:0 "Germany is Offering Us Help With Our Industry"
Ostasien.203.d:0 "The German East Asian Government on behalf of Germany has recognised our dire situation and has offered some of their factories on our land to work temporarily to supply our arms production. While this seems most helpful, one must ask himself what will the cost be when the war ends..."
Ostasien.203.a:0 "Our governments survival depends on this, as sad as it is."
Ostasien.203.b:0 "We can't affort to get entangled in their web even more!"
Ostasien.204.t:0 "The Factory Lease Ended"
Ostasien.204.d:0 "The terms imposed by the A.O.G. dictate that the lease of their factories ends today. They have proven most useful in our struggle, and we are sure the Germans know this as well."
Ostasien.204.a:0 "We will have to accept the consequences of this 'help'."

Ostasien.205.t:0 "The Kramat Pulai Mine Depletes."
Ostasien.205.d:0 "The Kramat Pulai Mine, the chief source of our tungsten exports, has turned us into one of the leading suppliers of tungsten worldwide. However, reports from the mine have indicated a drying-up of the scheelite deposits in the mine, and warn of an impending complete exhaustion of the mine in the near future."
Ostasien.205.a:0 "Worrying."
Ostasien.206.t:0 "The Kramat Pulai Mine Collapses!"

#Ostasien.207.t:0 "Ostasien and The A.O.G."
#Ostasien.207.d:0 "As the primary centre of German influence in Asia, the work of the Ostasien administration often crosses paths with that of the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung, or AOG. While we retain direct control of Guangzhou and Tsingtau, through the AOG, an administrative body operating inside the League of Eight Provinces, we are able to indirectly profit from several key coastal concession cities, alongside various German-owned infrastructure and industries further inland. The AOG does not answer to Ostasien, nor we to them; nevertheless it is in both of our direct interests to support and protect each other where we are able."
#Ostasien.207.a:0 "Cooperation is key."
Ostasien.207.t:0 "AOG influence in China Grows..."
Ostasien.207.d:0 "Amidst a season of mixed news, it appears our partners in the AOG have managed to come across a stroke of good fortune. The completion and purchase of the Zhegan railway, a large-scale rail project inside the League of Eight Provinces, has allowed the AOG to spread its influence deeper into Chinese territory. While some responses to the AOG's actions have been less than pleasant, we can safely assume that this is a sign of good things to come."
Ostasien.207.a:0 "Good to hear."
Ostasien.208.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the A.O.G.!"
Ostasien.208.d:0 "Our Chinese partners have weathered the Black Monday crisis no better than us it would seem, with German businesses, already facing pressure from local elements, being hit particularly hard. The Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, once thought too big to fail, is teetering on the edge of collapse, and the trickleback effects of this financial instability are already being felt by our own financial sector."
Ostasien.208.a:0 "You too, huh?"
Ostasien.209.t:0 "German Businesses Flee the League."
Ostasien.209.d:0 "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces into civil war, German confidence in the status quo, and China in general, has collapsed also. While Qi Xieyuan has guaranteed to support German interests upon his victory, belief in the continued survival of the AOG and its valuable concession cities is rapidly plummeting."

Ostasien.210.d:0 "With the complete eradication of the Nanjing clique, the chapter of Germany's influence in China appears to have hit a major wall. We are doing our best to absorb the displaced Nanjing administration in our concessions, but the reality of the loss of our main Chinese ally is hard to come to grips with. The AOG stands vigilant though, and the German East Asian administration keeps tabs on the breakaways that have appeared out of the League’s absence. "

Ostasien.211.t:0 "German Business returns to China."
Ostasien.211.d:0 "With the successful survival of the Nanjing clique, confidence in Chinese business has begun to return.

Ostasien.211.a:0 "Business as usual, then."
Ostasien.212.t:0 "Ties with Ostasien"
Ostasien.212.d:0 "With our current amicable relations with Germany secure, the Ostasien administration has taken steps to support our fledgling naval buildup. While their reasons for doing so are no doubt entirely pragmatic in nature, the help they have offered is no less beneficial to our own survival. German engineers have offered to provide new ship designs to our dockyards, or, alternatively, an offer of a permanent naval attache to further train our own navy has been suggested."
Ostasien.212.a:0 "We will incorporate their light ship design."

Ostasien.214.d:0 "The sweltering jungles of the Indochinese peninsula contained some of the densest, harshest terrain on Earth; it's dark forests and treacherous caverns swallowing many a poor soul whole as they become lost in its dark maw. This hell on Earth deters all but the most courageous, or crazy, of men and it is here that Ferdinand Schörner has taken up a post. With the fires of syndicalist revolution fast spreading across the region, Schörner has taken to putting down these leftist rebels in a cold and efficient manner. Showing no remorse, his military genius is second only to his brutality as he butchers his way across the south of asia. Under his command, the German East Asian military has bombed these leftist dogs back to the stone age as Schörner shows no mercy or quarter, and at his order, his soldiers have gunned down, burned alive, or even exploded the foul Red’s in their crusade to save the colony and maintain German hegemony in the region. In his eyes, he is simply cleansing the Kaiser’s rightful land of the putrid taint of Syndicalism, and he will perform this needed exorcism of Marxist filth without remorse. As long as Schörner is in Indochina, the Kaiser’s light will continue to gleam over this backwater, and under his command, the forces of German East Asia will be triumphant!"

#Fleet Exercise
#With the arrival of new capital ships, our fleet has experimented and exercised new group tactics. Maybe it's time to have a joint exercise with the High Sea Fleet?
#Fleet Exercise
#Admiral Hellmuth wanted to hold a fleet exercise between the High Sea Fleet and the East Asian fleet. The East Asian fleet is known for their tactic innovation. This might be a good chance to examine our fleet tactics.
#Kaiserliche Marine has decided to launch a large-scale naval exercise in Indian Ocean. The scenario is be a war for the control of Indian Ocean between the Black fleet in a defensive stance and a superior Yellow fleet aimed to destroy the Black fleet and seize the control of the Andaman Islands. The powerful Yellow Fleet, commanded by admiral Wilhelm Marschall, is comprised of some most modern battleships in the High Sea Fleet. The Yellow Fleet will conduct their operation from Trincomalee naval base. Now it's time to decide our fleet composition and plan.
#Deploy our battleships for a face-to-face combat!
#Deploy battlecruisers for strategic deterrance!
#Deploy carrier groups for long-range operation!

#The Yellow Fleet tried to seize the Andaman Islands
#The exercise has started. The intelligence and air reconaissance suggests that the Yellow fleet is actively preparing the invasion of the Andaman islands. It's estimated that the Yellow will try to secure the Bay of Bengal with concentrated fleet, and then launched the invasion. Should we take a defensive stance to intercept Admiral Marschall's fleet in the area close to the Andaman islands, or try to take the initiative to disturb enemy operation by aggressive actions?
#Intercept them
#Take the initiative!

#Result: Black fleet tactic defeat - battlecruisers
#The Black fleet located the invading Yellow fleet by air reconaissance. Our battlecruisers soon encountered the Yellow scout cruisers. Although the Yellow fleet was slaughtered by Black battlecruisers in the initial encounter, Yellow battleships managed to arrived in time and overwhelmed the Black fleet with massive firepower. One Black battlecruiser suffered critical hits in their engine room and failed to escape but the rest returned to [GetNameGEASingapore]. Having suffered heavy loss of cruisers, the Yellow fleet doesn't have enough screen ships to support the amphibious assault either. The battle was considered a tactic defeat of the Black fleet but the result was strategic stalemate.

#Result: Black fleet tactic victory - battleships
#The Black fleet located the invading Yellow fleet by air reconaissance. The Black scout line spread out in front of the main battle force soon encountered the Yellow scout cruisers. The Black battelships were placed in execellent position to deal serious blows to the Yellow cruisers. Admiral Marschall's main force came into action before the cruisers were annihilated. Over the next hours both fleets exchanged long-range gunfire. The new rangefinders on SMS Neckar allowed it to deliver precious hits even when firing at extreme range. Admiral Hellmuth broke the engagement before the Yellow fleet could shorten the range and fully exploit its numerous advantage. managed to withdraw, it had suffered heavy loss and lost the ability to defend the Andaman islands, and the Yellow fleet eventually was able to launch an amphibious operation. Although the battle was indecisive, the Yellow fleet doesn't have enough screen ships to support the amphibious assault and the exercise ended up with Black fleet's strategic victory.

#Result: Black fleet strategic defeat - battleships
#Black's advance was quickly located by the Yellow's picket line of submarines, depriving them of any advantage of surprise. Soon, the Black fleet encountered the Admiral Marschall's cruiser group west of the Andaman islands. The Yellow cruisers turning to the north-west on a course to rejoin the battleships. The Black fleet pursued the cruisers until the Yellow battelships moved into position. Over the next hours both fleets exchanged long-range gunfire and the Black fleet was outgunned by the superior Yellow fleet. When Admral Hellmuth's fleet managed to withdraw, it had suffered heavy loss and lost the ability to defend the Andaman islands, and the Yellow fleet eventually was able to launch an amphibious operation. The exercise ended up with Black fleet's strategic defeat.


#Result: Black fleet strategic victory - battlecruisers
#Admiral Hellmuth decided to disperse his cruisers to harass the Yellow fleet and use battlecruiser to support them. These commerce destroyers posed great threats to the Yellow convoys. The Yellow fleet attempted to fend off the raiders by search and destroy actions but the Black cruisers avoid the engagement. Finally Admiral Marschall decided to disperse his fleet to protect the convoys. In an engagement, the convoys escorted by a Yellow battleship was assaulted by a Black raiding fleet supported by three battlecruisers. The convoys were savaged before the reinforcement arrived. The Yellow fleet was deterred from further actions. The result was judged a strategic victory of Admiral Hellmuth's Black fleet.

#Result: Black fleet decisive victory - carriers
#Admiral Hellmuth decided to take an audacious action: The black fleet comprised four aircraft carriers plus supporting ships under the command of the Admiral moved to about 200 miles south of Sri Lanka. The first attack wave of 93 aircraft took off in pre-dawn darkness heading towards Trincomalee. The air strike achieved complete surprise. The Yellow battle fleet and convoys are at anchor in the harbour of Trincomalee and failed to organise any resistance. Aerial torpedo experts in all modern navies had previously thought that torpedo attacks against ships can not take place in shallow waters, but the Ostasien fleet had developed a new method of preventing torpedoes from diving too deep. The air strike delivered a devastating blow to the Yellow fleet with suprisingly little loss of planes. The exercise ended up with Black decisive victory.

#Result: Black fleet decisive victory - carriers
#The Black carriers and screen ships formed a concentrated battle group sailing towards the west. The scout bombers managed to locate the Yellow convoys by the morning. A massive attack wave was launched but the pilot missed the position of the convoys. Instead, they discovered the location of the Yellow main forces. The Ostasien torpedo bombers launched their strike with deadly precision. As a result of two waves of aerial attacks, at least three Yellow battelships and two cruisers were judged to have suffered damage, among which one cruiser considered to be hit by three torpedoes was judged sunk. The loss of Black aircrafts was negeligible. The exercise ended up with Black decisive victory.

#Result: Black fleet strategic defeat - carriers
#The Black's advance was quickly located by the Yellow's picket line of submarines. Due to the failure of reconaissance, Black carriers encountered the scout cruisers fleet of the Yellow. Significant damage was laid on carriers during the surface gunfire action, with Hellmuth's carrier eventually judged sunk by torpedo from a Yellow destroyer. The Black fleet had lost the ability to defend the Andaman islands, and the Yellow fleet eventually was able to launch an amphibious operation. The exercise ended up with Black fleet's strategic defeat.
