PRC_revival_of_forgotten_faction:0 "Revival of the Forgotten Faction"
PRC_revival_of_forgotten_faction_desc:0 "Since the failure of the Northern Expedition and the subsequent splitting of the Kuomintang into the Left & Right, the latter would seem to fade into irrelevance in the eyes of non-Chinese states. Despite this, our current revolt against the Qing monsters shows that we are still fighting and shall continue fighting in order to reclaim our recognition as the true successors to Dr Sun."
PRC_deal_with_peasants:0 "Issues with the Peasantry"
PRC_deal_with_peasants_desc:0 "With the success of our initial revolt against the Liangguang government, we have come to control an area that has had much socialist influence. In the Baise region, the Guangdong Peasants Association has held out with its Left-KMT allies, which has now become a threat to our hold over the region as we now face our old friends once more…"
PRC_divided_rays_under_the_sun:0 "Divided Rays Under the Sun"
PRC_divided_rays_under_the_sun_desc:0 "With the split of the Kuomintang into the left and right factions, both sides would also experience their own factionalism from within. Since the collapse of our main headquarters, we have had to branch off to multiple HQ’s, reflecting the preferences and conditions of certain factions. The faction currently in charge is the West Hills Group (WHG), who are a group of conservative intellectuals who seek to unite around Dr. Sun’s words, which they argue do not have any pro-socialist sympathies. The WHG currently is based in Hong Kong and Guangzhou in an underground capacity. Second is the Political Science faction, which acts in a more progressive faction of the Right-KMT meaning they are more willing to work with more moderate Left-Kuomintang factions than other Right-Kuomintang factions. The base of the Political Science faction is mainly in Chinese overseas communities and also in underground political scenes within Chinese urban hubs. Third is the Central Club Clique, who are based along with some RKMT guerilla units but have their main leadership located in Japan, which is where they have studied in and have close ties to. The final faction is the Huangpu faction, which is more of a militant faction of New Guangxi Clique officers. They carry out a large part of the RKMT’s guerilla actions in the south with some compromises with their LKMT enemies, as to tackle the Qing/Foreign forces in the region."
PRC_legacy_of_failure:0 "Legacy of Failure"
PRC_legacy_of_failure_desc:0 "In mid 1926, Chiang Kai Shek would attempt the Northern Expedition against the Zhili forces up north (having thought that the south was secured). Alas this would be futile as the Qing/Zhili forces would crush his advance and Chiang would be forced to retreat south, where he would later be assassinated by a car bomb. This failure would cause many KMT units to both idolize and hate Chiang and would be further pushed into a corner, with many KMT forces going into guerilla warfare and taking different sides in the party split. Now we remember those days in shame but also remember them as a lesson to be learnt. We shall avenge our losses from the 1st expedition and crush the foreign invaders for good."

###Baise National Spirits###
PRC_peoples_militias:0 "People's Militias"
PRC_peoples_militias_desc:0 "With the defeat of the KMT in Liangguang, the Left-KMT and its socialist allies would go underground and start a guerrilla campaign, which found its action in protecting the masses. As a result small rural militias would be formed under the KMT and GQNX guidance and be used to fend off against local bandits and brutal Qing forces. Now with the success of the Baise Uprising, our newly formed army is comprised of these militias, though this may not suffice for our goal of Chinese liberation."
PRC_success_for_the_peasants:0 "A Success For the Peasants"
PRC_success_for_the_peasants_desc:0 "As our flag rises above Nanning, we declare our victory over the Guangxi bandits and hence send forth a declaration of our intent to liberate all of Liangguang from reactionary tyranny. The peasants of Guangxi have stood up and so will the rest of China’s."
PRC_lands_in_need_of_reform:0 "Lands In Need of Reform"
PRC_lands_in_need_of_reform_desc:0 "Despite initial local attempts at land reform by our guerilla forces, we have yet to decide on how to operate a dedicated program for land reformation that can be applied on the provincial and even national level. Years of landlord exploitation and the poor living conditions of the peasants has damaged much of the land itself, risking starvation for the masses. With this, the peasants have begun taking some matters related to their old lords into their own hands, which we may have to intervene in to allow fair justice to those landlords."

###Political Descs###
POLITICS_PRC_XU_CHONGZHI_DESC:0 "Xu Chongzhi was born into the famous Xiguan Xu family in Guangzhou. In 1903, he entered the third infantry class of the Japanese Army Academy. In 1906, he joined the Tongmenghui. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as the commander of the 20th Brigade of the 10th Regiment of the Fuzhou Army. He participated in the uprising and served as the commander-in-chief of the uprising army. That year, he even threatened his superior, Fujian Admiral Sun Daoren, to join the Tongmenghui. In November 1911, he ordered the uprising army to fire the first artillery shell, which marked the beginning of the Fujian Uprising War. The Qing army was ultimately defeated. In 1913, he participated in the "Second Revolution" and fled to Japan after its failure. In Japan, he joined Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Revolutionary Party. At the end of 1915, he returned to China and participated in the Anti-Yuan National Defense War. After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, he returned to Shanghai and served as the Minister of Military Affairs of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. In 1917, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Grand Marshal's Office of Sun Yat-sen's Law Protection Military Government, assisted Sun Yat-sen in presiding over military affairs, and became one of the main military leaders of the Guangdong Army. In 1919, the Guangdong Army was reorganized into two armies, with Chen Jiongming as the Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong Army and the Commander of the First Army, and Xu Chongzhi as the Commander of the Second Army. After Chen Jiongming's subordinates launched the June 16th Incident, Xu Chongzhi's troops entered southern Fujian via Jiangxi. From August to September, Xu Chongzhi's troops cooperated with Wang Yongquan's mixed brigade stationed in Fujian to attack Fuzhou from Jian'ou and Nanping simultaneously. Li Houji fled in panic, and Fujian was occupied by Xu and Wang's troops. In January 1923, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, he served as the commander of the Eastern Route Anti-bandit Army and attacked Chen Jiongming, who was entrenched in Guangdong, from the direction of southern Fujian. In 1924, he became the commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army of the Republic of China and became the highest-ranking military general of the Kuomintang. By 1923, Liangguang was invaded by the Zhili forces of Luo Peijin, leading to the KMT being slowly pushed out, with the final failures of the Northern Expedition by Xu Chongzhi’s close ally Chiang Kai-shek culminating in the KMT’s split and exile from the country. Xu, however, decided to stay and fight in a guerrilla campaign against the Qing and formed the Whampoa faction in mid-1930 to give the guerrilla forces a greater voice within the Right-wing KMT’s party leadership. By 1936, Xu had managed to briefly unite the party in a new struggle against Zhang Mingqi’s Liangguang clique, preparing to take over Liangguang and later the rest of China."
PENG_PAI_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Peng Pai was born into this large landowning family on October 22, 1896, and his grandfather gave him the nickname Peng Tianquan. Tianquan was greatly influenced by his mother Zhou Feng's background as a poor farmer. At six, his grandfather sent him to the Qishengma Palace to study at Ma Ziqing's private school. Two years later, he entered Lin Zuci Primary School and studied under Lin Jinting, a member of the Tongmenghui. In 1917, he went to Japan, changed his name to Peng Pai, and enrolled in Political Economics at Waseda University. During his stay, he experienced the rice riots and was deeply affected by the 1917 October Revolution and the May 4th Movement. He participated in anti-German protests, was beaten, and blacklisted by the German police, transforming into a socialist revolutionary. Upon returning to China in 1921, Peng Pai became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and joined the Kuomintang (KMT). He sided with the CPC during the CPC-CSP split but later worked with the Left Kuomintang after the CPC’s dissolution. In response to a petition from students in Haifeng, Chen Jiongming instructed the Haifeng County Magistrate to appoint Peng Pai as the director of the Haifeng County Education Bureau. In March 1922, after issuing a declaration about wall demolition and clashing with the gentry Chen Yuebo, he was forced to leave Haifeng County. Peng Pai participated in establishing the Guangdong Socialist Youth League in Guangzhou. After returning to Haifeng, he was dismissed from his post for organizing a student parade to celebrate May Day. He then engaged in the peasant movement. Peng Pai joined the Kuomintang as an individual and served as the Secretary of the Peasant Department of the Central Executive Committee. He proposed a peasant movement implementation plan, adopted by the Kuomintang. On June 30, 1924, the Kuomintang decided to open the Guangzhou Peasant Movement Workshop based on Peng Pai's proposal. He served as the first Director of the 1st and 5th Agricultural Lecture Centers, completing the "Report on the Peasant Movement in Haifeng." With the defeat of the Kuomintang in the late 1920s, Peng worked with the Left-KMT guerrillas, organizing the Guangxi peasant movements in coordination with the Left-KMT and workers' unions, creating a network to secure the Left-KMT's hold in Guangxi against the Right-KMT, local bandits, and the Qing provincial government."
