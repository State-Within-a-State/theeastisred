communistrevoltcsp.1.desc:0 "As a result of the Black Monday crisis, workers in the factories of the legation cities, started to move on strike. These strikes would be a result of economic instability, growing Chinese nationalism and the failure of better working conditions. The Governor General of the legation cities is faced with a choice, whether to use the local police for call in international aid, to suppress the strikes."
communistrevoltcsp.2.desc:0 "When calling in the local police force, the officers of Chinese ethnicity defect to the protestors. As for feeling pride for their country. The worker's welcome them with open arms. But now the defecting police are now giving access to weapons in which the protestors start to take. Violence now threatens the street."
communistrevoltcsp.3.desc:0 "After days of protest between police and rioters in Hong Kong, the situation deforms into violence,  this would overpower  the police force. This topples the legation cities Hong Kong office. And now is under leftist control."
communistrevoltcsp.4.desc:0 "The major city of Tianjin suffered the 2nd worse protests, with their situation being the same to Hong Kong. More and more concerns on whether the legations should evacuate politicians to their respective countries."
communistrevoltcsp.5.desc:0 "After the loses of HK and Tianjin the legation government decides with to ask for foreign troops again or refuse to do so. This comes as protestors in Shanghai get more and more violent."
communistrevoltcsp.6.desc:0 "Huzzah! The Government of the legations cities has collapsed. Now we have liberated the Shanghai worker! but have lost Hong Kong and Tianjin to other forces that took advantage if the chaos. As the revolutionaries secure the city the capitalists leave the shores bound for their imperialist lovers. They shall not come back. We have liberate the Shanghai basin."
technocraticchina.1.desc:0 "The Chinese Technocratic Party has won over Revolutionary Shanghai. \n\n Ren Bishi - Born in Hunan, Ren is a proponent of Peasant-Based socialism. He is well known through political circles for good reason, as he has dealt with the law multiple times before the Legation Cities became what it is today. As far as policy goes, Ren has emphasized that, for the Shanghai government to survive, it must be well armed like a conventional army and should look away from Guerilla warfare. While Ren considers himself to be a technocrat, his peers are much more extreme than him. \n\n Guo Moruo - While his title as an Archaeologist might make one think that Guo is a weak man, that could not be further from the truth. Guo is known to write poems denouncing those who antagonize him, especially hard-line communists. As such, he is considered to be the most dogmatic anti-dogmatist in Shanghai. Guo’s program emphasizes “adaptable socialism” and repression of counter-revolutionary elements while holding science, specifically science that studies the past, to be a cornerstone of civilization. Guo is also known for his article, Corpus of Inscriptions on Bronzes from the Two Zhou Dynasties, a highly controversial work. \n\n Nie Rongzhen -  Born to a rich family in Sichuan, not much is known of his ideology other than his military leanings and his European influence. Like other technocrats, he wants Shanghai to have a modernized, European inspired army to be able to protect the country. A point of departure for him, though, is high vicious devotion to the anti-imperialist cause and, further, against nationalistic causes. While many of his peers have died, he seems to be immortal. \n\n Fang Yi - If you were to study the academic scene of Shanghai, Fang Yi would be one of the most notable people. Firmly within the Technocratic faction, Fang has achieved yet another step towards his journey to educate China. As the president of the Chinese Academy of Science, which serves as a think tank to all parts of China, his agenda lies in modernizing China to its utmost point, intersecting heavily with Marxist thought. Although he has good intentions, his election may cause the Academy to gain unprecedented control over the governance of the Shanghai Government. \n\n Lu Dingyi - Lu Dingyi is one of the most important and accomplished journalists in China, having worked with several famous newspapers. Behind his journalism, though, lies a strong socialist message. In a pamphlet he published himself, he explains his goals if elected. A member of the technocratic faction, he is distinctly focused in advancing literature, media, and propaganda. With Lu in charge, Shanghai can expect a cultural revolution; he wants to advance the mind of China to its Zenith."

leagueleftwing.7.desc:0 "Shanghai’s Arts scene has long been dominated by the bourgeois and the whims of the gentry-mercantile class, but this state of affairs is now changing: in the days after the League’s rise to power, a hundred flowers have blossomed amongst the common folk. Now Ding Ling, self-avowed radical, calls for a further revolution in all manner of art - to displace what she terms 'shallow, bourgeois' modernity with a more proletarian vision of art. A forum has been convened to promote art that will tear the Chinese people away from the past and push them into class consciousness.\n\nSome products of this Forum leave much to be desired: for every artpiece with significant proletarian connotations, there are two or three which simply confuse if they do not spark outright social chaos. Radical plays challenging workers to free themselves through literacy campaigns and oppression share space with barely disguised raunchy material, and several more 'avant-garde' artists have been accused of exploitative violence against society in the name of their work.\n\n Nevertheless, the Shanghai authorities describe the Forum as a measured success at its true goal - radicalizing and reforming the mind of the Chinese people through exposure to the sublime and the beautiful. "
leagueleftwing.10.desc:0 "Shocking news came from Shanghai today: the League of Left-wing Writers' campaign against reactionary elements has reached dangerous levels of violence. Skyrocketing incidents of localised violence and crime have surpassed the ability of the authorities to control crime, and news flows in from Shanghai's outlying suburbs of mass lynchings thinly disguised as "revolutionary committees". In one infamous incident, a family was dragged in front of a tribunal of their neighbors, denounced as reactionary for their defense of their son's purchase of a Western magazine, and then summarily hanged. Their property and possessions were then distributed amongst the neighbors as a "reward for their revolutionary efforts".\n\nWhile the League has denounced all such behavior as a means of perpetuating bourgeois social oppression under a veneer of social revolution, it is unclear how the government intends to regulate such activity. It seems the revolutionary bonfire will burn for quite awhile before being put out."
leagueleftwing.11.desc:0 "It is often said that sons shall outdo their fathers: this much is true of the Little League, the radical youth wing of the League of Left-Wing Writers. This organization has been tasked with cleansing the society of Shanghai from counter-revolutionary influences, and they have set about this task with aplomb: today a hundred reactionaries accused of crimes ranging from bigotry and social traditionalism to outright counter-revolutionary behavior were shot in a mass execution just outside the city's suburbs. Members of the Little League accost families and households to identify and summarily execute those attached to the old ways, while in revolutionary schools children are asked to report on their parents voluntarily to ensure Chinese society's progression to true modernity.\n\nDespite widespread condemnation by other governments, the League's leadership remained steadfast in a recent press conference, attributing the atrocities to "zealous errors". It appears the tide of blood sweeping through Shanghai shall be undeterred by even the elders who shepherded it into being."
syndicalistchina_flavor.4.desc:0 "The Shanghai government's recent turn away from socialist economics has not whetted its appetite for political control, it seems: Chairman Deng Xiaoping has helmed a widely-publicized commission aimed at destroying the ‘counter-revolutionaries’ opposing the Shanghai Revolutionary Government. Of course, a cursory inspection reveals that these counter-revolutionaries are anything but: many of them involve old political allies who have criticized and rejected the ideas of Deng's regime. Leftists, both from more vanguardist philosophies and from more libertarian or anarchist backgrounds, were accused of a variety of crimes against the ‘development and fortification of Chinese Socialism’ and forced out of any government positions they might have had.\n\nThe move has been met with wide criticism by other erstwhile supporters of Shanghai's revolution, both in China and abroad, but the government has not been shy in hitting back: Deng himself led the charge with incendiary speeches calling all opponents of the trials ‘in league with the capitalists, who seek to undermine China's path to socialism with bourgeois-liberal influences'."
syndicalistchina_flavor.7.desc:0 "The market reforms undertaken by Chairman Deng Xiaoping are undoubtedly a necessary step towards socialism, however, the nastier side effects of economic liberalization are beginning to bubble to the surface. Firstly, inflation is on the rise as a natural result of our government’s investments in the economy, leaving many workers and peasants with less wealth than they had before our government came into power. This has left many workers and socialists feeling alienated from our party and program. However, not everyone has suffered under the new economic regime, in fact, some folks are succeeding a bit too much for the liking of others. Many see in the rising Chinese middle class a revival of the brutal class systems that oppressed them in the past, and although we have done much to reassure them that we would never allow that level of exploitation, there are a growing number of those who distrust our words. Despite these challenges, the market reforms are popular among government officials, and few see an end in sight."
syndicalistchina_flavor.9.desc:0 "It appears that the Shanghai Revolutionary Government's reforms have met with further resistance from the most volatile and radical segment of Chinese society: our students. Across the universities controlled by the Shanghai Government, senior student union leaders call for a retreat from revisionist economic policies, citing the rapid increase in corruption scandals and the growth of a new elite from the bureaucracy. What is particularly worrisome is that some are calling for a more open and participative form of Syndicalist governance as well - an implicit threat against the legitimacy of our government.\n\nRadio and newspaper publications have not helped with this dangerous situation, with many popular columns turning against the regime and encouraging discussion of the differences between the works of Marx and the policies of our own regime. Despite constant warnings against bourgeois liberalism, the press has only grown bolder in its criticisms, with some even noting how the Ming Dynasty's abandonment of the common people led to its collapse. If we are ever to regain the love of the people, we must act quickly - or we risk tumbling over the abyss."
syndicalistchina_flavor.10.desc:0 "The Shanghai Revolution has been hit with yet another criticism, its harshest and most influential one yet - and from an unexpected source. An article from Peking University's alumnus, written anonymously, comprehensively attacks the Deng regime's economic stance on free markets within socialism, demonstrating its essential inability to solve the problems of capital inequality or to end class conflict. Indeed, the article points out, Shanghai's struggles suggest that in the even poorer and more unstable regions of rural China the programme will serve to entrench inequality and the dominance of landlords rather than serving to dismantle them.\n\nThe article has become something of a sensation, with student movements across Shanghai quoting the article's key assertion, that ‘to follow Mr Democracy, we must first know where we stand’. Despite attempts at government censorship, it appears Beijing's involvement has made waves in Shanghai that will last for quite awhile."
syndicalistchina_flavor.11.desc:0 "The crucible of Shanghai's student movement is boiling over: Months-long protests have culminated in an impromptu wall constructed across the municipal districts of Shanghai by radicalized students. These students demand a broad agenda of economic reforms and the loosening of state restrictions on assembly and speech, and a series of incendiary speeches by student leaders in Shanghai further called for "direct elections and the formation of independent political parties". The Wall's posters reflect these demands, but also a broad consensus that both liberalization of our scientific establishment and the adoption of American models of commerce and welfare should be adopted. It appears the student movement is now beginning to question the very principles that brought the Shanghai Government into being, and our government's legitimacy also hangs by a thread.\n\nIf it is necessary, we should consider bringing our most loyal units into the city, to ensure the preservation of order, security and the Chinese revolution..."
syndicalistchina_flavor.14.desc:0 "In what the Revolutionary Government described as a ‘killing blow to deviationism’, senior members Mao Zedong, He Long and Liu Shaoqi from the Hunan branches of the Chinese Syndicalist Party were executed en masse today. Sorrowful notes from across China mourn the collapse of yet another possibility for the Chinese revolution, in particular Mao and Liu's visions of a rurally led and spontaneously mobilized peasant movement popularized in a famous report on Hunan's revolutionary conditions.\n\nChairman Zhang's speech today flatly condemned the deviationists and promised a full renewal of Chinese Syndicalist party cadres to totally destroy the ‘poison’ of faux-populist rhetoric before it infected other regions in China, while renewing promises of a utopian future fully guided by the Party alone. It remains to be seen if these promises will serve their intended effect on China's teeming rural populations, or infuse them with new hatred for their leadership in Shanghai."
syndicalistchina_flavor.15.desc:0 "Not too long ago the workers and peasants of China cried out for liberation, for guidance and for enlightenment from their feudal bondage: the weight of a thousand years weighing on them as shackles around their necks. Now, under the full guidance of Chairman Zhang, the twin burdens of national subjugation and class-based humiliation have been removed! Under the loving care of Zhang's Syndicalist Party, workers and peasants alike enjoy freedom from famine and exploitation, and their standards of living now improve by the year. It is even said that soon the average peasant shall enjoy soup with meat year-round! \n\nThe Chinese landscape, too, glimmers with new factories, infrastructure and townships, as industrial workers' guilds march ceaselessly to beat back imperialism from the factory line. Across this beautiful country workers and peasants organize to celebrate the Sun of the Chinese people, the Father of the Revolution and the centre of all political life: Zhang Guotao, liberator of the Chinese masses!"
syndicalistchina_flavor.17.desc:0 "It is known that the struggle for the liberation of the Chinese masses cannot be done only through the bullet, but also through the pen and the brush. Today the Marshal of the Chinese People and Vanguard of the Revolution, Zhang Guotao, has begun the offensive on Japanese imperialism in culture - with a magnificent mural painted on the boarded-up Astor House Hotel, Shanghai's biggest hotel in the former Bund. Above a landscape of hundreds of Chinese soldiers fighting against subhuman Japanese troops, the spirits of Chinese civilisation past and future are portrayed as waging war on a sinister-looking Samurai figure. The Yellow Emperor, Guan Yu the God of War, and Confucius wield fearsome swords, beating the Japanese wokou back to their islands and squalor. \n\nThe artwork is painted by Jiang Feng, one of our most prominent art students, and its bright colors and expressionism will surely appeal to the teeming masses who have traveled to Shanghai to marvel at its intricacy. One can only hope that the recruitment booths for the People's Army nearby will meet with similar enthusiasm…"

chinacommunistparty.1.desc:0 "As the congress ends, the Bolshevicks in China win and establish the Chinese Communist Party. Now they go on to elect their own party leadership. First the radicals: \n\n\nQu Qiubai - Described as “the tenderhearted Communist,” revolutionary organizer. Qu is one of many people who, with his own eyes, saw the failed Soviet Revolution. Along with this, he has personally attended Lenin's lectures, which have affected him greatly, went to Leo Tolstoy’s house, and attended Pyotr Kropotkin’s funeral. With his varied experience, Qu Qiubai is one of the most radical communists in Chinese circles. While captured a few times, Qu has never broken from his beliefs, making many consider him a heroic figure for the leftist movement in China. As one of the most prominent people in the radical faction of the Bolsheviks, his ideology drifts when talking about the actions of the masses. He believes that they must be heroic, laying down their life for the movement and fighting with everything they have. With this election, the people of Shanghai can expect a hardline and “heroic” approach to Marxism. Interestingly, he is one of some communists who deny the Marxist-Leninist line and approach politics through a purely Leninist lens, however accurate that may be. \n\n\nGao Gang - There’s none quite like Gao Gang, the foremost member of the Radicals in the Bolsheviks. A man from Shaanxi province, he comes from a family of peasants. In fact, the only reason he could obtain a good education was because of moving to the city, although he is known to not be the most literate man in the world. Within the Bolsheviks, he is lauded as being both confident and ambitious, a great quality for a leader, of course. Known to climb the ranks quickly because of his dedication, his election presents a strong change in Shanghai. Of all the revolutionaries, you would definitely not call Gao Gang the most progressive, and his approach isn’t any different. Described by Western “experts” as National-Bolshevism, he takes a few deviations from concepts you’d think were established."
chinacommunistparty.2.desc:0 "Wang Ming - Wang Ming is the most agreeable man in the Bolshevik group, but paradoxically also a very disagreeable man. A firm believer in orthodox Marxism-Leninism, he is called “the epitome of foreign dogmatism” by his detractors, but they are not who is in power. With Wang in power, Shanghai is sure to follow the Marxist-Leninist doctrine heartfully, to the dismay of those who may dislike it. While Wang is strict, he is by far and wide not the strictest - indeed, experts predict a moderate approach to Marxism-Leninism to be pursued by Shanghai's government. \n\n\nYang Shangkun - A firm and powerful man in Bolshevik circles, Yang Shangkun has surely cemented himself as a mainstay of the Bolsheviks. To few people’s surprise, he came out on top in the Bolshevik elections. While he may have been born to a strong land-owning family, Yang has devoted his life to Marxism and the Marxist cause. Yang is a man with much experience, especially in management and military affairs. As well as all of that, Yang’s socialism takes a focus on coexistence with more moderate elements. A proponent of Broad Communism, he wants to create a system akin to a sort of “Market” Bolshevism, upholding a strong party that is tolerating, and with a new economic policy. He, at least in some part, models his actions with those of Zinoviev. "
chinacommunistparty.3.desc:0 "Li Lisan -  Li is an ideologically flexible leader, but he is serious about using Marxism-Leninism as a guiding principle in the People’s struggle in Shanghai. Unlike Wang Ming, Li is not vehemently opposed to the nationalistic form of Marxism popular through his land. He has a background in education and has studied abroad, mainly in France. Curiously, he first had contact with the Bolsheviks while abroad, reading an advertisement from a communist newspaper and deciding to meet whoever had published it. From there, his fervor reached new limits and made everyone else pale in comparison. Observers like to call his ideology “Hardliner Bolshevism.” taking a much harsher position than anyone else that may call themselves Bolsheviks, but maybe not too far from Bo Gu. \n\n\n Bo Gu - Bo Gu is a man known for his undying dedication to the anti-imperialist and socialist cause. Since around 1917, he has been contributing to this cause in one way or another. Whether it was studying, releasing papers, convincing the people he saw, undermining imperialist authority, or whatever you can think, Bo has done it. Bo is, somewhat unsurprisingly, considered to be a hardliner. However, his approach to Bolshevism is very controversial, aiming for a national characteric to it. If there is one element he neglects, it would be the internationalist aspect of Marxism. He aims to incorporate a faithful and accurate rendition of the original Bolshevik mission to Shanghai, as so, he uses a very rigid approach. It is important to note that Bo Gu is not his real name, it is an alias that means “familiar with histories”. He regards himself as an Orthodox Marxist, although some call him a National Communist."
chinacommunistparty.4.desc:0 "Reports from the central administration of Revolutionary Shanghai note that a coup has occurred. The old administration has been rounded up in a violent but not deadly coup and are now being sent to a prison in the outskirts of the city, more is yet to be seen from them. The coup was carried out by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, an institution made for internal control of the party to combat corruption. It seems that the past administration somehow angered the CCDI and as so has been dealt with. What will happen now is a mystery, hopefully they will follow in the mission of the Bolsheviks. \n\n\n All hail to the great leader Rao Shushi! The revisionists plaguing the party have been purged and with them their silly reform. Shanghai will finally become a truly revolutionary state, all through the benevolent leadership of your great leader, Rao Shushi! Having studied all over the world, Mr. Rao has a solid basis of knowledge that no one in the party can quite match, naturally making him a fitting leader. After the CCDI successfully couped the reactionaries, Rao Shushi proclaimed his leadership. \n\n\n News from the CCDI indicate that, after the coup, Kai Feng has proclaimed himself as the leader of the Revolutionary Shanghai. Kai has experience as the main trainer for the party, training both the leaders of the party and the workers that lead our great revolutionary state. As well as that, Kai is a proclaimed bolshevik, having seen the failed Bolshevik revolution with his own eyes while in Moscow. The benevolence of someone so experienced with the party school, with controlling those who make the party what it is, is very easy to question. It’s impossible to know his intentions."
chinacommunistparty.5.desc:0 "Pushing for a very non-chinese ideology, Li Fuqing has just won the elections in Shanghai. A Bolshevik veteran, Fuqing has quite the experience when it comes to waging war and seeing policy in real time. Somewhere along the line, though, he embraced a different revolution, the French revolution of 1791. Pushing for Jacobin values, he actually sees some acquiescence on the other side of the world, in the homeland of the revolution. The “Chinese Robespierre,” he does not shy away from spilling blood. Additionally, he has an eclectic mix of both nationalistic values and internationalist values. \n\n\nOf 2 Leninists in the Bolsheviks, Ban can be said to have followed Lenin in adapting his ideology to his current material conditions. Delightfully, he has recently won the elections in Shanghai, meaning his refreshing take on Leninism may have a real chance at fruition. Ban calls for a reimagining of Lenin but makes sure to emphasize that does not mean a revision of Lenin, simply a Chinese rendition of his ideas. Like many other bolsheviks, he does not shy away from using violence to get his way, even if others may be repulsed from it. He justifies it, like all, with ideology. With Ban in power, China will walk one step backward for some time while changes are made, but will take a leap after and become a Chinese Bolshevik dream."
