anarcho_china.4.title:0 "The Coalition Succeeds"
anarcho_china.4.desc:0 "Chen Jiongming's deposition is quick and relatively bloodless - surrounded by students and stripped of his security guards, Chen is sent to his ancestral home estate under armed guard. A provisional Anarchist government is proclaimed in place of his provincial regime, and anarchists across Chinese society begin flocking to the city where capitalists and Westerners once held an iron grip on society. \n \n \nAnarchists in Guangzhou now begin the difficult task of deciding how to govern, a task made all the more difficult by the entrenched powers in this province. Nevertheless, there is room for hope. \n \n \nGuangzhou was once the site of a failed revolution - now it is the seed for a true and lasting successor, one which will free not just the nation but Chinese society itself! Revolution is unavoidable, it is the future, and here in Guangzhou the path to this future will be built!"
anarcho_china.4.a:0 "Wansui!"
anarcho_china.5.title:0 "The Beginnings of Our Rule"
anarcho_china.5.desc:0 "The anarchist coalition to overthrow Chen Jiongming's rule was one born out of necessity. It seems clear that without a common enemy to unite against, the factions that made up the coalition will soon move against each other. Thankfully, no faction seems willing to attack without having secured an advantage for themselves. For now, a facade of unity holds as all factions seek to implement their own policies to grow their own support and overtake the others."

anarcho_china.8.title:0 "Cai Yuanpei Wins over the Population"
anarcho_china.8.desc:0 "Cai Yuanpei's faction focusing on the spread of higher living education and uniting traditional Chinese views on the "datong" (great unity of society) with modern humanism and anarchist ideology has won today."
anarcho_china.9.title:0 "Li Shizeng Wins over the Population"
anarcho_china.9.desc:0 "Li Shizeng's faction focusing on ruralized education and long-term moral revolution has won today."
