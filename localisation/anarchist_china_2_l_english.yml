anarcho_china.1.desc:0 "Within Guangzhou, anarchist societies have used Chen Jiongming's liberal policies on publishing to spread their ideologies. Among them are 3 distinct factions; the Ba Jin faction, the Cai Wenpei faction, and the Shifu-Shixin faction. \n \n \nThe Ba Jin faction focuses on classically individualist anarchism, focusing on literature and utopian idealism. Cai Yuanpei's group uniquely focuses on the spread of higher education and emphasizes a unity of traditional Chinese views on the "datong" (great unity of society) with Anarchist ideology. Shifu-Shixin, named after the Shifu movement of the 1920s, is perhaps the faction with the most populist appeal, and fittingly it is the most eclectic of the 3: with a dual strategy of ruralized education and moral revolution, it is as much a psychological as a social revolution. \n \n \nAll 3 factions are united in their independent stance vis-a-vis Guangzhou's KMT and Federalist movements."
anarcho_china.2.desc:0 "Something is approaching - as the East Coast is lit afire by the collapse of the reactionary Zhili pretenders, a great opportunity arises for bold men and women. The Great Enterprise, long whispered of by intellectuals, is afoot once more. \n \n \nChen Jiongming is almost certain to crack down on the fragile Anarchist coalition sooner rather than later, but for the gathered thinkers in a run-down teahouse in Guangzhou's western suburbs, this represents a last chance to break the chains of social reaction and tyranny. Chaos brings necessity, and out of it arises promise. \n \n \nAll 3 factions are present, and all 3 factions swear to wage a struggle to capture the institutions of the Guangzhou government and society. If they fail, there will be no return; if they succeed, China will be changed forever."
anarcho_china.3.desc:0 "The collapse of the Guangzhou Anarchists has meant an end to the Guangzhou Clique's dreams of a true Chinese anarchy. Crackdowns by the government have broken the hold of the Anarchist strongholds in universities, rural schools and student clubs, and presses are being dismantled across the country for suspicion of involvement in illegal pamphleteering. \n \n \nIntellectuals like Ba Jin are fleeing the county for more neutral ground in the Legation Cities, while others consign themselves to struggling with more mainline Marxist or KMT aligned movements. Either way, the Anarchist dream will have to wait for a future generation to be realized in full..."
anarcho_china.4.desc:0 "Chen Jiongming's deposition is quick and relatively bloodless - surrounded by students and stripped of his security guards, Chen is sent to his ancestral home estate under armed guard. A provisional Anarchist government is proclaimed in place of his provincial regime, and anarchists across Chinese society begin flocking to the city where capitalists and Westerners once held an iron grip on society. \n \n \nAnarchists in Guangzhou now begin the difficult task of deciding how to govern, a task made all the more difficult by the entrenched powers in this province. Nevertheless, there is room for hope. \n \n \nGuangzhou was once the site of a failed revolution - now it is the seed for a true and lasting successor, one which will free not just the nation but Chinese society itself! Revolution is unavoidable, it is the future, and here in Guangzhou the path to this future will be built!"
