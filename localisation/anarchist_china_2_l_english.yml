anarcho_china.1.desc:0 "Within Guangzhou, anarchist societies have used Chen Jiongming's liberal policies on publishing to spread their ideologies. Among them are 3 distinct factions; the Ba Jin faction, the Cai Wenpei faction, and the Shifu-Shixin faction. \n \n \nThe Ba Jin faction focuses on classically individualist anarchism, focusing on literature and utopian idealism. Cai Yuanpei's group uniquely focuses on the spread of higher education and emphasizes a unity of traditional Chinese views on the "datong" (great unity of society) with Anarchist ideology. Shifu-Shixin, named after the Shifu movement of the 1920s, is perhaps the faction with the most populist appeal, and fittingly it is the most eclectic of the 3: with a dual strategy of ruralized education and moral revolution, it is as much a psychological as a social revolution. \n \n \nAll 3 factions are united in their independent stance vis-a-vis Guangzhou's KMT and Federalist movements."
anarcho_china.2.desc:0 "Something is approaching - as the East Coast is lit afire by the collapse of the reactionary Zhili pretenders, a great opportunity arises for bold men and women. The Great Enterprise, long whispered of by intellectuals, is afoot once more. \n \n \nChen Jiongming is almost certain to crack down on the fragile Anarchist coalition sooner rather than later, but for the gathered thinkers in a run-down teahouse in Guangzhou's western suburbs, this represents a last chance to break the chains of social reaction and tyranny. Chaos brings necessity, and out of it arises promise. \n \n \nAll 3 factions are present, and all 3 factions swear to wage a struggle to capture the institutions of the Guangzhou government and society. If they fail, there will be no return; if they succeed, China will be changed forever."
anarcho_china.3.desc:0 "The collapse of the Guangzhou Anarchists has meant an end to the Guangzhou Clique's dreams of a true Chinese anarchy. Crackdowns by the government have broken the hold of the Anarchist strongholds in universities, rural schools and student clubs, and presses are being dismantled across the country for suspicion of involvement in illegal pamphleteering. \n \n \nIntellectuals like Ba Jin are fleeing the county for more neutral ground in the Legation Cities, while others consign themselves to struggling with more mainline Marxist or KMT aligned movements. Either way, the Anarchist dream will have to wait for a future generation to be realized in full..."
anarcho_china.4.title:0 "The Coalition Succeeds"
anarcho_china.4.desc:0 "Chen Jiongming's deposition is quick and relatively bloodless - surrounded by students and stripped of his security guards, Chen is sent to his ancestral home estate under armed guard. A provisional Anarchist government is proclaimed in place of his provincial regime, and anarchists across Chinese society begin flocking to the city where capitalists and Westerners once held an iron grip on society. \n \n \nAnarchists in Guangzhou now begin the difficult task of deciding how to govern, a task made all the more difficult by the entrenched powers in this province. Nevertheless, there is room for hope. \n \n \nGuangzhou was once the site of a failed revolution - now it is the seed for a true and lasting successor, one which will free not just the nation but Chinese society itself! Revolution is unavoidable, it is the future, and here in Guangzhou the path to this future will be built!"

anarcho_china.5.title:0 "The Beginnings of Our Rule"
anarcho_china.5.desc:0 "The anarchist coalition to overthrow Chen Jiongming's rule was one born out of necessity. It seems clear that without a common enemy to unite against, the factions that made up the coalition will soon move against each other. Thankfully, no faction seems willing to attack without having secured an advantage for themselves. For now, a facade of unity holds as all factions seek to implement their own policies to grow their own support and overtake the others."

anarcho_china.10.desc:0 "From its beginnings as an unwieldy coup against the Liangguang government, the anarchist movement in China has beaten all expectations: some attribute it to the anachronistic but effective ideology at its heart, organized on the principles of Buddhist social organization and Anarchist politics. Yet this belief now stirs at the heart of the Chinese polity, for the old alliance between Taixu and Li Shizeng simmers with discontent. Taixu has long called for an explicitly Buddhist and wholly religious re-orientation of Buddhism, and it is now well-known that he views the current state of affairs as an improper compromise. Indeed, several more radicalist communes under his influence have already threatened to secede several times. \n\n Shizeng and Shifu are themselves deeply suspicious of Taixu, believing him to be a saboteur and a closet conservative. In several communal conferences organized since the start of the Anarchist Revolution, they have attempted to delineate the boundaries of Taixu's influence, to limited success. The time has come to deal with this - or risk the whole communal system falling apart. \n\n It is a searingly bright day in the Guangzhou Communal Municipality. Several rural militia regiments are suddenly mobilized to seize Shizeng and Shifu, marching into the city - they make it just past the gates before they encounter city militias mobilized to stop them. Explosions and gunfire rip through the city, before the dust settles and the victor becomes clear…"
anarcho_china.11.desc:0 "Shi Cuntong has long been an outspoken critic of the emerging system of government in the Guangdong Commune, even as he collaborates with Cai Yuanpei on shaping it. Cai's view on the formation of an intellectual-bourgeois, student-based movement that pushes anarchist values into the countryside has long been in conflict with Shi's own more orthodox and Marxist traditions. In fact, Cai's opening of an infamous ‘aesthetics and morality’ curriculum nationwide was criticized in a major newspaper by an anonymous author bearing the hallmarks of Shi's own writing style! It is clear that the two have grown increasingly incompatible, and their beliefs have polarized the Communal system along 2 divergent lines. \n\n Cai makes the first move, using the powers granted to him as chief educator to lock out Shi Cuntong from all student-agitation groups: yet several groups working with Shi refuse to follow the call, and a day of unrest follows as the radicalized student groups begin making their way towards the capital. A trail of smoke and fire follows each of the impromptu armies, marching towards government buildings and being hailed with volleys of gunfire. Residents struggle to sleep under artillery fire as the struggle consumes all of Guangzhou, and the militias clash like some great hammer and anvil under a stormy sky. \n\n As the fires settle and the University clears of smoke, it is now clear that…"
anarcho_china.12.desc:0 "The acceleration of Ba Jin's assault on the traditional order was at first welcomed by his closest political allies: many of them were close friends loyal to the shared vision of a radically equal, fully new society, and helped shape his movement's destruction of the old order. Yet the increasingly savage attacks on not just traditional religion but all aspects of human life - commerce, industry and even the structure of the human psyche - have horrified many of these old allies, and one by one they have come to quietly desire a change to the political leadership of the Commune. Mao Dun is perhaps a somewhat peripheral figure, but it is him that these elites have coalesced around as a non-threatening, centrist and moderate figure to help moderate the Commune's ever-radicalizing policy. \n\n Things come to a head as Ba Jin descends further into radical fury, and after a hastily-stopped execution order calling for the 'burning of Chengdu' for its recalcitrance in breaking up all traditional gentry households, the decision is made. Mao Dun leads a guard of militiamen pulled from the provinces, far from Ba's concentrations of political strength, and marches to his estate to end this threat once and for all. \n\n The crucible fizzes, and the smell of cordite and gunpowder fills the air. As the dust clears…"
