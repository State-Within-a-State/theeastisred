PRC_revival_of_forgotten_faction:0 "Revival of the Forgotten Faction"
PRC_revival_of_forgotten_faction_desc:0 "Since the failure of the northern expedition and the subsequent splitting of the Kuomintang into the Left & Right, the latter would seem to fade into irrelevance in the eyes of the non-chinese states. Though as of now, we have revolted against the Qing monsters and forever shall yearn to reclaim our recognition as the true successors to Dr Sun."
PRC_deal_with_peasants:0 "Issues of the Peasants"
PRC_deal_with_peasants_desc:0 "With the succession of our initial revolt against the Liangguang government, we have seemed to encompass an area held out by socialists. In the Baise region the Guangdong Peasants Association has held out with its Left-KMT allies, this has now become a threat to our hold in the region where we now face our old friends once more…"
PRC_divided_rays_under_the_sun:0 "Divided Rays Under the Sun"
PRC_divided_rays_under_the_sun_desc:0 "With the split of the Kuomintang into the left and right factions, both sides would also experience their own factionalism from within. Since the collapse of our main HQ, we have had to branch off to multiple HQ’s, reflecting the preferences and conditions of certain factions. The main faction incharge is the West Hills Group (WHG) , are a bunch of conservative intellectuals who seek to unite around Dr. Sun’s words, but they also denounce any pro-socialist sympathies within his ideology. The WHG currently is in Hong Kong and Guangzhou in an underground capacity. 2nd is the Political Science faction, which acts in a more progressive faction of the Right-KMT, and are more willing to work with more moderate Left-Kuomintang factions. The base of the Political Science faction is mainly in Chinese overseas communities and also in underground political scenes within Chinese urban hubs. 3rd is the Central Club Clique, who are based along with some RKMT guerilla units but have their main leadership located in Japan, in which they have studied in and have close ties to. The final faction is the Huangpu faction, which is more of a militant faction of New Guangxi Clique officers. They carry out a large part of the RKMT’s guerilla actions in the south with some compromises with their LKMT enemies, as to tackle the Qing/Foreign forces in the region."
PRC_legacy_of_failure:0 "Legacy of Failure"
PRC_legacy_of_failure_desc:0 "In mid 1927, Chiang Kai Shek would attempt the Northern Expedition against the Zhili forces up north(having been thought to have secured the south). Alas this would be futile as the Qing/Zhili forces would crush his advance and Chiang would be forced to retreat south, where he would later be assassinated by a car bomb. From this the KMT would both idolize and hate Chiang and would be further pushed into a corner, with many KMT forces going into guerilla warfare, with KMT guerilla taking different sides in the party split. Now we remember those days in shame but also remember them as a lesson to be learnt. We shall avenge our losses from the 1st expedition and crush the Foreigners invaders for good."
