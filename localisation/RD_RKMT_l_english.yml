PRC_revival_of_forgotten_faction:0 "Revival of the Forgotten Faction"
PRC_revival_of_forgotten_faction_desc:0 "Since the failure of the Northern Expedition and the subsequent splitting of the Kuomintang into the Left & Right, the latter would seem to fade into irrelevance in the eyes of non-Chinese states. Despite this, our current revolt against the Qing monsters shows that we are still fighting and shall continue fighting in order to reclaim our recognition as the true successors to Dr Sun."
PRC_deal_with_peasants:0 "Issues with the Peasantry"
PRC_deal_with_peasants_desc:0 "With the success of our initial revolt against the Liangguang government, we have come to control an area that has had much socialist influence. In the Baise region, the Guangdong Peasants Association has held out with its Left-KMT allies, which has now become a threat to our hold over the region as we now face our old friends once more…"
PRC_divided_rays_under_the_sun:0 "Divided Rays Under the Sun"
PRC_divided_rays_under_the_sun_desc:0 "With the split of the Kuomintang into the left and right factions, both sides would also experience their own factionalism from within. Since the collapse of our main headquarters, we have had to branch off to multiple HQ’s, reflecting the preferences and conditions of certain factions. The faction currently in charge is the West Hills Group (WHG), who are a group of conservative intellectuals who seek to unite around Dr. Sun’s words, which they argue do not have any pro-socialist sympathies. The WHG currently is based in Hong Kong and Guangzhou in an underground capacity. Second is the Political Science faction, which acts in a more progressive faction of the Right-KMT meaning they are more willing to work with more moderate Left-Kuomintang factions than other Right-Kuomintang factions. The base of the Political Science faction is mainly in Chinese overseas communities and also in underground political scenes within Chinese urban hubs. Third is the Central Club Clique, who are based along with some RKMT guerilla units but have their main leadership located in Japan, which is where they have studied in and have close ties to. The final faction is the Huangpu faction, which is more of a militant faction of New Guangxi Clique officers. They carry out a large part of the RKMT’s guerilla actions in the south with some compromises with their LKMT enemies, as to tackle the Qing/Foreign forces in the region."
PRC_legacy_of_failure:0 "Legacy of Failure"
PRC_legacy_of_failure_desc:0 "In mid 1926, Chiang Kai Shek would attempt the Northern Expedition against the Zhili forces up north (having thought that the south was secured). Alas this would be futile as the Qing/Zhili forces would crush his advance and Chiang would be forced to retreat south, where he would later be assassinated by a car bomb. This failure would cause many KMT units to both idolize and hate Chiang and would be further pushed into a corner, with many KMT forces going into guerilla warfare and taking different sides in the party split. Now we remember those days in shame but also remember them as a lesson to be learnt. We shall avenge our losses from the 1st expedition and crush the foreign invaders for good."
