indochina_rework.8.desc:0 "The glorious liberation of Indochina has sent shockwaves across Asia and the news that the people of an impoverished South-East Asian region could rise up against their colonial overlords and break their chains has spread like wildfire even to the most remote regions chafing under imperialist influence. Evidently these news have also reached Guangxi, where in a remote village controlled by KMT guerrillas, a certain man in particular becomes ecstatic upon hearing that his own people had risen up and thrown of the shackles of the Germans. This man is none other than Ho Chi-Minh. Having long been assumed to have fallen during a skirmish in Guangxi, Ho Chi-Minh was found badly wounded by forces loyal to the KMT and nursed back to health. Feeling that he had been disgraced, and that he was still in peril, Ho had decided to stay behind in China and live out his days in peace, until now. Packing up what few belongings he had, Ho begins his long march home. \n \nUncle Ho walks into the ILP(Indochinese Labour Party) congress. Faces are in shock and awe; everyone not knowing if what they are seeing is real. Ho Chi Minh stands at the podium and reveals a scar under his eye patch. Shocked and amazed the congress vigorously claps for him as he then announces that he is back to lead the people of Indochina. The rest of the congress continues..."

viet_event_flavor.1_desc:0 "As the party congress goes on, Ho Chi Minh seeks to go out and talk to the masses in Saigon. The event becomes highly publicized with thousands flocking to see him speak. He is an idol; a hero to them all. Ho Chi Minh walks up on to the podium, but as he starts to speak, a Cambodian ultra-nationalist pulls out a revolver and shoots him in the back. The assaliant is quikcly tackled to the ground and crowds screem in panic. Ho Chi Minh is quickly dragged to hospital barely surviving the encounter. \n\n As the next day breaks he is told that he would not be able to walk again as he is paralized from the waste down. Hearing this ho Chi Minh's allies close around him begging him to retire. Ho Chi Minh now has a choice of his campaign continuation, or settle for retirement."
viet_civil_war.0.desc:0 "After Ho Chi Minh announces his resignation from political life and the national congress, the congress breaks up further with each side accusing one another of the assassination.Over the next few days fights break out in the congressional building as cermounting tension brews with in the government.The congress results are in. The results show a deadlock.The congress is now indefinently split."
viet_civil_war.1.desc:0 "Now at the deadlock is announced the country goes into free fall. In this chaos the anarchists launch a small but brief uprising around the capital occurs with the military being called in to crush the anarchists. Some small congress members are quickly arrested with suspicion of his involvement in the uprising.Due to the election results and subsequent breakdown in civil order, the syndicalists launch a national strike in which again was put down by the military, in which Thau is arrested in a similar fashion and reason to Ninh.As chaos rises, the military takes the final straw and coups the government. Installing Vo Nguyen Giap as leader of the red junta. Giap himself is a loyal ally of the HCM faction of the party in which causes him to invite other HCM supporters to the government. \n\n Martial Law is Declared..."
inc_rework.0.desc:0 "Compatriots throughout the country! \n\n  Out of love for peace we have made concessions. But the more concessions we made, the further the German colonialists went because they are resolved to invade our country once again.  No! We would rather sacrifice everything than lose our country, than return to slavery.\n\n  Compatriots! Rise up! Men and women, old and young, regardless of creeds, political parties, or nationalities, all the Vietnamese, Laos, Cambodians must stand up to fight the German colonialists to save the Fatherland. Those who have rifles will use their rifles. Those who have swords will use their swords. Those who have no swords will use their spades, hoes, and sticks. Everyone must endeavor to oppose the colonialists and save his country.\n\n Soldiers, self-defense guards, militiamen!  The hour of national liberation has struck! We must sacrifice to our last drop of blood to save our country. Whatever hardships we must endure, we are ready to endure them. With the determination to sacrifice, victory will be ours!\n\n Long live independence and liberty!\n\nLong live the victorious resistance!"
inc_rework.3.desc:0 "Ho Chi Minh, is the father of our country and us the masses must follow his moral example of being a good revolutionary and proletariat. The masses shall celebrate his ideas of national equality and anti exploitation. With also some looking to his celibacy as part of the reason for his great exemplary revolutionary mind. Books on his works are now being published monthly, with speeches and quotes of HCM being published. The people shall follow HCM great revolutionary example."
inc_rework.4.desc:0 "As Paris applies more and more pressure, and the Syndicalist faction gains strength each day, should we extend our hands and rebuild socialism together in Indochina? Or will the sword of revolution rise to eliminate the traitors?"
inc_rework.7.desc:0 "Ho Chi Minh, is the father of our country and us the masses must follow his moral example of being a good revolutionary and proletariat. The masses must understand his thoughts and writings. We shall create programs for our youth to understand him and also programs to help educate the masses on his heroic and revolutionary deeds. The masses shall study and embrace the revolutionary hero for the savior he is."
inc_rework.8.desc:0 "The time has come to make indochina into a final stage of national development. As we have helped our comrades grow, we shall now grant them a form of independence but will form a confederation to keep unity between the ethnicities. We shall govern Vietnam, Cambodia shall be led by Tou Samouth, and Laos shall be led by Kaysone. We shall forever live the indochinese communist cause til the very end!"
viet_civil_war.4.desc:0 "As the country has now gone into collapse, we now face the issue of reaction rebels in the North and separatists to the west. We shall save Vietnam, once and for all, and will crush these reactionary Cambodian separatists. As HCM recovers in hospital, Vo Nguyen Giap promises to avenge Uncle Ho, and destroy the reactionary forces that tried to kill him. We shall fight for Uncle Ho and the Indochinese People’s Revolution!"
viet_civil_war.5.desc:0 "As we have won against our reactionary rebels, we now decide our fate for our renewed Indochinese revolutionary future. First is Giap, who seeks to continue the practice of Ho Chi Minh’s ideas and to keep Indochina under a unitary state. Next is Tran Phu, who was one of the original communists of the Indochina Communist Party before it was disbanded after the failure of the October Revolution in russia and subsequent loss of members to the Indochinese syndicalists. He seeks to make indochina go under the proposed model that Lenin envisioned for Russia in which a system of soviet republics would be formed and be overseen by a general government elected by democratic-centralism. Finally is Souphanouvong, who is a socialist prince who seeks to make Indochina a socialist kingdom."
