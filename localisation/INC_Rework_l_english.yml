tester.2.d:0 "The glorious liberation of Indochina has sent shockwaves across Asia and the news that the people of an impoverished South-East Asian region could rise up against their colonial overlords and break their chains has spread like wildfire even to the most remote regions chafing under imperialist influence. Evidently these news have also reached Guangxi, where in a remote village controlled by KMT guerrillas, a certain man in particular becomes ecstatic upon hearing that his own people had risen up and thrown of the shackles of the Germans. This man is none other than Ho Chi-Minh. Having long been assumed to have fallen during a skirmish in Guangxi, Ho Chi-Minh was found badly wounded by forces loyal to the KMT and nursed back to health. Feeling that he had been disgraced, and that he was still in peril, Ho had decided to stay behind in China and live out his days in peace, until now. Packing up what few belongings he had, Ho begins his long march home. \n \nUncle Ho walks into the ILP(Indochinese Labour Party) congress. Faces are in shock and awe; everyone not knowing if what they are seeing is real. Ho Chi Minh stands at the podium and reveals a scar under his eye patch. Shocked and amazed the congress vigorously claps for him as he then announces that he is back to lead the people of Indochina. The rest of the congress continues..."

He is an idol; a hero to them all. Ho Chi Minh walks up on to the podium, but as he starts to speak, a Cambodian ultra-nationalist pulls out a revolver and shoots him in the back. The assaliant is quikcly tackled to the ground and crowds screem in panic. Ho Chi Minh is quickly dragged to hospital barely surviving the encounter. \n\n As the next day breaks he is told that he would not be able to walk again as he is paralized from the waste down. Hearing this ho Chi Minh's allies close around him begging him to retire. Ho Chi Minh now has a choice of his campaign continuation, or settle for retirement."

inc_rework.0.desc:0 "Compatriots throughout the country! \n\n  Out of love for peace we have made concessions. But the more concessions we made, the further the German colonialists went because they are resolved to invade our country once again.  No! We would rather sacrifice everything than lose our country, than return to slavery.\n\n  Compatriots! Rise up! Men and women, old and young, regardless of creeds, political parties, or nationalities, all the Vietnamese, Laos, Cambodians must stand up to fight the German colonialists to save the Fatherland. Those who have rifles will use their rifles. Those who have swords will use their swords. Those who have no swords will use their spades, hoes, and sticks. Everyone must endeavor to oppose the colonialists and save his country.\n\n Soldiers, self-defense guards, militiamen!  The hour of national liberation has struck! We must sacrifice to our last drop of blood to save our country. Whatever hardships we must endure, we are ready to endure them. With the determination to sacrifice, victory will be ours!\n\n Long live independence and liberty!\n\nLong live the victorious resistance!"
