###Political Descs###
WANG_WENMING_POLITICAL_DESC:0 "Wang Wenming, with the courtesy name Qinfu and the pseudonym En'an, was born on November 1, 1894 in a peasant family in Yiliang Village, the fourth district of Lehui County in eastern Hainan. In 1919, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal May 4th Movement broke out in Beijing. Wang Wenming, with a firm stand and selfless work spirit, threw himself into the movement and was successively elected as the vice president of the Qiongya Thirteen Students' Union and the president of the Qiongya Boycott German Goods Association. He became an outstanding leader of the Qiongya student movement. He led the Qiongya students to go deep into the masses of workers and peasants, publicize the proposition of opposing imperialism and feudalism, spread new culture and new ideas, and awaken the Qiongya people. In the autumn of 1921, Wang Wenming graduated from high school and was later appointed as the principal of Shuangmiao High School in Qiongdong County. In addition to teaching, Wang Wenming made friends with like-minded people who wanted to change reality and transform society, and jointly planned to transform society. In 1922, Wang Wenming resigned from the position of principal and founded the first completely new school in Qiongya that combined teaching with production labor in Jiaji City with Luo Han, a member of the Chinese Socialist Youth League who returned from Europe to spread revolutionary ideas, and Wang Dapeng, the democratically elected progressive county magistrate of Qiongdong County. Wang Dapeng served as chairman, Luo Han as principal, and Wang Wenming as director of academic affairs. During this period, Wang Wenming met Wu Ming, a communist who came to Qiongya, and joined the Communist Party of China in the autumn of the same year. Though later on Wang would go on to leave the party due to the CPC’s dissolution after the CSP’s split in 1922. With this Wang Wenming would go one to turn the Thirteen Students Union into a genuine political force which would face periods of suppression by the Zhili forces dominating the island. In order to help secure his party’s safety, Wang would work with the KMT guerillas in the region to help defend the party and the peasants on Qiongya.By 1927, Wang would be able to secure and expand the students union to encompass, KMT guerillas, peasant associations and trade unions, allowing him a certain degree of power against the Qing overlords in the region. As of 1936 Wang Wenming still remains the leader of his movement with high popularity."
