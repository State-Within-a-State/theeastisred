JAPSOCDEM_maximist_approach_desc:0 "Though we have gained a temporary dominance over the Japanese government, there are still many enemies present. Just as the previous governments attacked us at every turn, like when they shut down the Peasant-Labor party a mere hour after its creation, so too will we attack them now that we have the power to. These enemies who attacked us out of their class interest will face the same attacks against them out of our own class interest."

JAPSOCDEM_kempeitai_reforms:0 "Kempeitai Reforms"
JAPSOCDEM_kempeitai_reforms_desc:0 "We shall increase the responsibilties of the Kempeitai after reforming it to make sure it is politically loyal. Our newly reborn intelligence agency will be able to secure our state against our enemies both internal and external. There will be many disgruntled European empires who would seek to destroy us for being against them and just as many right-wing "nationalists" in the military who would be willing to sell out their country for personal wealth. The Kempeitai will be our main check against both."

JAPSOCDEM_under_the_chrysanthamen_desc:0 "With the crown under our government, we have an incredible propaganda tool.

So too do the miltary men support us for our emphasis on military expansion. All are loyal to the emperor and our government."
JAPSOCDEM_revoking_liberal_democracy:0 "Revoking Liberal Democracy"
JAPSOCDEM_revoking_liberal_democracy_desc:0 "Liberal democracy has proven to be not very democratic. The voices of the countless suffering and dying were never addressed by previous governments. Rather, the voices that were listened to were the very ones causing the suffering and death. Though better than the feudal political structure, our new political system is far more democratic than the liberal system ever was. The lives who were wasted by the previous system will now be able to shine fully."

JAPSOCDEM_promoting_the_national_socialist_image_desc:0 "After the sudden and tragic loss of our leader Aso, we now must continue our rule of Japan, and decide who shall succeed him. Akamatsu who was the main ideologue behind our party and our rule under Aso, is the natural successor. However, there are many other factions who seek control. Asanuma's radical faction has been steadily gaining power in the background of Aso's rule partly due to his charisma and powerful public speaking skills. Due to his history of working in peasant organizations like farmer unions, Hirano is supported by the rural workers for the position. Meanwhile, Yamana's Sorelian-based vision of working with the newly rejuvenated productive bourgoise has gained the support of the right-wing and apolitical collaborators. "

JAPSOCDEM_national_socialist_continuance_desc:0 "The time has come for the grey eminance behind our previous rule to reveal himself. Akamatsu had been hard at work making important political decisions. With our reign now secured, it is time for him to leave the shadows and take center stage. National socialism now, national socialism tomorrow, national socialism forever!"
JAPSOCDEM_Asanuma_total_victory:0 "Asanuma's Complete Victory"
JAPSOCDEM_Asanuma_total_victory_desc:0 "Though he may have lost control of the Shakai Taishuto to the national socialist faction, Asanuma didn't just disappear. Instead, he watched and learned. Indeed, the peaceful path he had previously advocated for would never have rid Japan of the parasites that ruled it in the past. After all, if even Aso's "revolutionary" rule couldn't remove them due to them being allowed to join the party and corrupt it, then how could have working inside the system they created have done anything? Seeing the similarities between his previous beliefs and Aso's rule due to their willingness to cooperate with non-ideological opportunists, Asanama created a faction along with other cooperative marxists in order to reorganize the party into a true vanguard of the proletarian class to prevent the dilution of the revolutionary message of the party. With his assumption of power, this reorganization has started and with it has come the downfall of several of Asanama's previous competitors. This reorganization will impact all sectors of society with some believing that even the emperor himself is not safe."
JAPSOCDEM_agrarian_victory:0 "The Peasant's Advocate"
JAPSOCDEM_agrarian_victory_desc:0 "With the acension of Hirano, the peasants know their livelihood is now secure. This cooperative relationship of the peasants supporting Hirano in a miriad of different ways in exchange for Hirano supporting various legislation that improves the lives of the peasantry has already led to the victory of Hirano and the peasant faction over the other forces who sought to take over after Aso. Even more greatness will surely be achieved under Hirano's rule. Yet there are skeletons in Hirano's closet that could potentially destroy his rule. The many factions that sought victory will continue circling around waiting for any opportunity to strike and take control. Hirano will need to keep his cards close to his chest and deal with these opponents to his rule if he wishes to succeed."
JAPSOCDEM_sorelian_victory:0 "The Rightists Triumphant"
JAPSOCDEM_sorelian_victory_desc:0 "With the recent entry into our party of many less ideological people due to us being the ones ruling Japan, is it any suprise they would help decide the successor of Aso? Though Yamana may have his beliefs about how to create a democracy of classes where both proletarian and bour·geoise classes unite for a single goal, the group of military-men, technocrats, and bureaucrats that back him have no such ideological convictions. Only time will tell how Yamana's rule will turn out. Time that some opposition factions may not have."
