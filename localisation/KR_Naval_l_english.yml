### Multi-hull Techs ###
carrier_conversion:0 "Converted Carrier Hull"
carrier_conversion_desc:0 "Having learned from the experience of using seaplane tenders, those navies with the resources to do so began work on the next generation of ships that could carry aircraft at sea. Unlike their predecessors, these carriers were designed with flight decks to allow for aircraft to both fly off of them and to then return and land on them. Converted from civilian ships and seaplane tenders, most of these ships were limited by having relatively cramped flight decks and hangars, but they definitely demonstrated that ships were capable of effectively operating air complements at sea."
weltkrieg_heavy_ship_hull:0 "Weltkrieg Heavy Hull"
weltkrieg_heavy_ship_hull_desc:0 "Designed shortly before the Weltkrieg began, and completed while it raged, these classes represented the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and would remain highly potent long after it ended. While they were notably faster than the Dreadnoughts before them their most notable differentiating feature was their escalated armament- they carried eight to ten main guns, of 14 to 15 inch or equivalent, most in twin turrets but a few in new triple turrets. Their devastating firepower and heavy armour guaranteed that they would be at the heart of their battle fleets, but those continued advances came at quickly escalating prices. Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."
weltkrieg_cruiser_hull:0 "Weltkrieg Cruiser Hull"
weltkrieg_cruiser_hull_desc:0 "Better quality armour and the development of steam turbine engines led to the rise of light armoured cruisers. Faster and better protected than protected cruisers, these designs came to supplant them in the 1910s."

bracket_shooting_desc:0 "To hit the target, the first step is to straddle it by firing a few guns at a time until the impacts hit on both sides of the target."
ladder_shooting:0 "Ladder Shooting"
ladder_shooting_desc:0 "Instead of firing over the target and losing track of the impacts behind the enemy ship, shots are deliberately dropped short of the target and the distance between impact and target measured to determine the range."
shell_dyes:0 "Shell Dyes"
shell_dyes_desc:0 "Adding small colour packages to the shells when they are fired colours the impacts around the target and allows multiple ships to engage the same target without being confused by each other's impacts."

### MTG Hulls ###

### Light Hulls ###
ship_hull_light_1:0 "Weltkrieg Light Ship Hull"
ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg brought a new demand for destroyers- not only were they required to protect their fleets, but they were also stretched thin to protect the Entente shipping lines as well. To meet this need, destroyer designs were streamlined, entering mass production to keep up with demand. Ships of this era were typically 1000 tons, and travelled at a top speed of 34 knots, while carrying a larger pair of torpedoes than their forebears."
ship_hull_light_2:0 "Improved Light Ship Hull" #Late Interwar
ship_hull_light_2_desc:0 "By 1935, with increasingly potent new aircraft designs entering service, as well as several navies deploying fleet carriers, while there was still some doubt about just how useful the carriers would be in open warfare, concern over the potential threat that aircraft might pose to warships was growing. German carrier operations during the Chinese intervention and continued British exercises had shown the world that the carrier had a purpose in the navy. As a result, this era of destroyer saw the introduction of the dual purpose primary armament, granting a vastly improved anti-aircraft role to the destroyer, again increasing their usefulness. Theses ships would displace up to 2,500 tons, often carrying increased payloads of torpedoes to offset the reduced torpedo load-out on more modern cruisers."
ship_hull_light_3:0 "Advanced Light Ship Hull"
ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "With the start of the Second Weltkrieg the world's navies needed cheap anti-aircraft platforms. The British success with carrier combat had shown the world that they were suited for more than just recon and anti-carrier duties, they were required for modern anti-capital ship warfare. Advanced anti-submarine technologies like the new hedgehog depth charges were playing an essential role in combating the major threat to convoy operations, they and the anti-aircraft platforms intensified demands for more destroyers. Were previously destroyer investments were being lowered in favour of cruisers and the new armoured cruisers, destroyers began to return to the fore as an essential part of both the fleet, and the convoy system. While often not larger than their predecessors they were far more technologically advanced, mostly adopting flush decks and far larger torpedo armaments."
ship_hull_light_4:0 "Modern Light Ship Hull"
ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "Near the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the navies of the world were forced to adapt to new submarines that could stay submerged for almost indefinite periods of time, carriers were loaded full of planes more than capable of destroying capital ships, and big gun cruisers were quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of carriers and submarines. The future role of the escort for the main fleet was being taken over almost solely by destroyers in the minds of most naval theorists, with dual purpose rapid firing turrets destroying any planes that dare cross her path in an attempt to dive bomb her. The displacement of these vessels rose as well, often coming up to 3,000 tons as designers loaded them with more and more anti-aircraft weapons, as well as more primary guns."

### Cruiser Hulls ###
ship_hull_cruiser_1:0 "Weltkrieg Cruiser Hull" #Light Armoured
ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Better quality armour and the development of steam turbine engines led to the rise of light armoured cruisers. Faster and better protected than protected cruisers, these designs came to supplant them in the 1910s."
ship_hull_cruiser_2:0 "Improved Cruiser Hull" #Interwar
ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The interwar period saw refinements of larger cruisers that had appeared since the Dreadnought Race. With politics and finances still constraining many naval powers, the designs produced were only marginally larger in size than the previous generation, instead seeing upgrades in firepower through the use of eight inch guns or the growing adoption of triple turrets and quadruple torpedo tubes. With the importance of aircraft growing in naval warfare, anti-aircraft armament was also considered, leading to the adoption of high-angle dual-purpose mounts for three-five inch guns, supplemented by a growing array of auto-cannons."
ship_hull_cruiser_3:0 "Advanced Cruiser Hull"
ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Thanks to increased available funding, the new cruisers built at the end of the interwar period and the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg saw another slight growth in their size. Once more, while the primary armament's calibre remained, with few exceptions, in the 7-8 inch range, their firepower was increased further by adding an extra turret or raising the number of guns in each turret if that had not been done in the previous generation. Secondary armaments were further upgraded with further twin dual-purpose guns and even more dedicated anti-aircraft armament, often linked with improved fire controls. This generation also saw the growing adoption of radar systems on cruisers."
ship_hull_cruiser_4:0 "Modern Cruiser Hull"
ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The cruisers of the late-war and early post-war period remained similar to the ones of the early war, while incorporating the numerous lessons learned throughout. With air power confirmed to be one of the greatest threats to ships, designers focused on improving AA capabilities even further through better fire-control, improving coordination between batteries and radar. Some navies also experimented with autoloading mechanisms for the main armament, dramatically improving their rates of fire. The rapid pace of rocket and missile development would eventually prove to be the demise of all-gun ships, including cruisers, making this the last generation of 'old type' cruisers for numerous navies."
ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship:0 "Coastal Defence Ship"
ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship_desc:0 "Coastal defence ships were small, often cruiser-sized warships that sacrificed speed and range for armour and armament. They were usually attractive to nations that either could not afford full-sized battleships or could be satisfied by specially designed shallow-draft vessels capable of littoral operations close to their own shores."
ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff:0 "Revived Armoured Cruiser"
ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc:0 "In the wake of the Revolution in France, the republican government was left deeply concerned about the shipbuilding capabilities of the Commune. Lacking any real ship production facilities and possessing a limited budget, they were forced to place orders internationally, with the now empty naval yards of the Two Sicilies. Their design was intended as an intermediate class, with the guns and range to fight older battleships on their own terms as well as the speed to chase down lighter cruisers and escape the more modern battleships they had no chance of beating themselves. Quickly nations such as Ukraine, Austria, and the Two Sicilies received several orders for more ships of this variety, saving the shipbuilding facilities and experience these nations could no longer afford to sustain, and seeing a burst in construction at the birth of this new design type."
ship_hull_torpedo_cruiser:0 "Torpedo Cruiser"
ship_hull_torpedo_cruiser_desc:0 "Based on the Jeune École doctrine which held that small warships armed with torpedoes could effectively and cheaply defeat much larger battleships, these cruisers are primarily armed with torpedoes."
#Heavy Hulls
ship_hull_heavy_1:0 "Weltkrieg Heavy Hull"
ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "Designed shortly before the Weltkrieg began, and completed while it raged, these classes represented the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and would remain highly potent long after it ended. While they were notably faster than the Dreadnoughts before them their most notable differentiating feature was their escalated armament- they carried eight to ten main guns, of 14 to 15 inch or equivalent, most in twin turrets but a few in new triple turrets. Their devastating firepower and heavy armour guaranteed that they would be at the heart of their battle fleets, but those continued advances came at quickly escalating prices. Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."
ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "Interwar Heavy Hull"
ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The end of the Dreadnought Race, with the start of the British Revolution, led to large scale naval construction largely ceasing, and naval funding, which had grown to enormous levels in the period up to 1925, finally collapsing. The 'Great Powers' spent the next decade slowly finishing ships already under construction, while focusing development on smaller ships that were easier to slip through the naval budgets. It wasn't until the early 30s that the Great Powers began to experiment with fast battleship designs. These battleship designs were far more modern, with improved rangefinders, powerful oil fired engines, and 16 to 18 inch guns, but were generally iterative, focusing more on delivering a powerful ship at the best price rather than being a drastic improvement over their predecessors."
ship_hull_heavy_3:0 "Advanced Heavy Hull"
ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "With the Second Weltkrieg on the horizon and international tensions higher than ever, designers were looking to construct a new generation of ships to fight in the upcoming war. While some nations had transitioned their naval hopes to carriers, others still insisted that the carrier could only provide a supplementary role, rather than replacing the primary anti-capital ship role of the battleship. These nations, typified by Germany, instead retooled their newer designs, focusing on improved armour layouts and more effective guns and turrets, as well as improved speeds."
ship_hull_heavy_4:0 "Modern Heavy Hull"
ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "At the close of the Second Weltkrieg, the Great Powers were faced with an indisputable fact- naval air power had proved victorious over all gun capital ships. However, several nations persisted with the development of Battleships, as shore bombardment platforms, prestige projects and support for carriers within the fleet. Designers loaded their battleships with anti-aircraft batteries, as well as the latest anti-aircraft rocket technology. These designs would prove less than successful over the years; while many of these battleships would continue to be operated well into the 70s, they were widely viewed as obsolete, and mostly functioned to ferry Heads of State on national voyages and to occasionally provide shore bombardment support during regional conflicts."
ship_hull_super_heavy_1:0 "Dreadnought Hull"
ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "The rapid increase of resources devoted to naval construction after the end of major land conflict during the Weltkrieg initially produced these designs, which featured the beginnings of the trends towards sudden growth in size, firepower, armour, calibre and of course, cost. Such vessels set the world's leading naval powers apart from the mere pretenders to greatness, but they had their issues; their rapid development and rushed construction led to design flaws and persistent mechanical problems. These designs were armed with eight to ten 18 inch or equivalent main guns, and had the protection to go toe-to-toe with similarly armed ships. As the Dreadnought Race reached its height, these true monsters were conceived. Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost was staggering, and few nations could afford to even consider constructing them. Nonetheless, those that did found themselves in possession of truly mighty weapons of naval supremacy. Even more so than the generation before them, they suffered from the conditions of their conception. Rushed design work, last minute and improvised redesigns during construction, shortages of the huge amount of resources they required, immense pressure to rush construction, and the sheer size and complexity of their massive mechanisms, all led to design flaws and vulnerabilities beneath their vast armoured hides. These designs were armed with twelve to fifteen 18 inch or equivalent main guns."
ship_hull_pre_dreadnought:0 "Pre-Dreadnought"
ship_hull_pre_dreadnought_desc:0 "Followed the design of the British Majestic-class of the late 1890s, Pre-Dreadnought battleships replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons.\n\nSince the 'Dreadnought' design made them obsoleted since before the Weltkrieg, coupled with the gigantic rise of Dreadnought-based designs in the previous three decades, only a few of them are still in service."

### Carrier Hulls ###

ship_hull_carrier_conversion_ca_desc:0 "Having learned from the experience of using seaplane tenders, those navies with the resources to do so began work on the next generation of ships that could carry aircraft at sea.

ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:0 "Converted Battleship Carrier Hull" #Experimental
ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "The first large aircraft carriers, these ships were built on hulls that were originally intended for capital warships but, for various reasons, converted and completed as carriers. Only a handful of navies built such ships, and their designs varied greatly; their aircraft capacities ranged from the low sixties to over a hundred. There were constants though, such as retained heavily armoured belts and other gun-warship features. Semi-experimental and unreliable, they were still incredibly formidable weapons, and laid the foundations for following generations of fleet carriers."
ship_hull_carrier_conversion_dng:0 "Converted Dreadnought Carrier Hull" #Experimental
ship_hull_carrier_conversion_dng_desc:0 "The first large aircraft carriers, these ships were built on hulls that were originally intended for capital warships but, for various reasons, converted and completed as carriers.

ship_hull_carrier_1:0 "Improved Carrier Hull"
ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "Developed in the late 30s, these ships were designed to provide aerial reconnaissance and light fighter coverage for fleets primarily focused on more 'conventional' warship forces. Their range was significantly increased, and efforts were made to make them fast enough to keep up with fleets operating at full speed in open oceans."
ship_hull_carrier_2:0 "Advanced Carrier Hull"
ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "As major naval combat operations in the naval aviation age demonstrated the power of aircraft to seriously affect battles at sea, many powers found themselves having fallen behind in the development of their carrier forces. While fleet carriers were quickly shown to be the most potent of their kin, they were also massive ships that required a long time and large amount of resources to construct. In the rush to increase their ability to project air power into the oceans, several powers turned to designs like these, enlarged versions of the existing lighter carriers, to try to quickly bolster their naval aviation capacity."
ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Modern Carrier Hull"
ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "Even once the dominance of fleet carriers had become indisputable, there were many powers that could not afford such ships, and even major naval powers that needed secondary carriers to cover less important naval regions. These ships were the designs that were created to fill those needs. Much smaller than the fleet carriers, they nonetheless incorporated design innovations developed from them, to produce effective smaller carriers that had respectable aircraft capacity, fast speeds, and reasonable anti-aircraft defence batteries."

### Submarine Hulls ###
ship_hull_submarine_1:0 "Weltkrieg Submarine Hull"
ship_hull_submarine_1_desc:0 "The first submersible warships actually capable of effective combat actions, these designs were significant improvements over their predecessors. With diesel-electric engines replacing the primarily petrol-electric engines of the first submarines, they had greatly improved range and surface speed. In combat with enemy warships, they acted mainly as submersible light torpedo boats, but lacked the submerged speed or endurance to remain underwater for more than relatively brief periods. These were the submarines that were used by the major naval powers during the Weltkrieg."
ship_hull_cruiser_submarine:0 "Large Submarine Hull" #cruiser Interwar
ship_hull_cruiser_submarine_desc:0 "Significantly larger than preceding submarines,these designs were of 'cruiser' type, designed for long-range independent operations in commerce raiding and intended to be better equipped to handle combat with enemy light warships while surfaced. As such, they carried heavier gun armament, and had improved surface speed. Their submerged capabilities, however, remained limited."
ship_hull_submarine_2:0 "Improved Submarine Hull" #Late Interwar
ship_hull_submarine_2_desc:0 "The evolution of the 'cruiser' submarine designs, some of these warships took those ideas further, with larger guns and a greater emphasis on surface abilities, while others began to look in the other direction, seeking to increase underwater capabilities and performance."
ship_hull_submarine_3:0 "Advanced Submarine Hull"
ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "The gains made by some earlier designs in extending underwater range, speed, and overall abilities, led to the turn in submarine development away from 'cruiser' types and back towards vessels with a greater emphasis on underwater capabilities. Vastly improved over earlier types, these submarines carried potent payloads of torpedoes and were a legitimate threat to almost all surface ships. However, they were still limited in submerged duration, range, and speed, and remained vulnerable when surfaced, especially to aircraft."
ship_hull_submarine_4:0 "Modern Submarine Hull"
ship_hull_submarine_4_desc:0 "With greatly increased battery capacity, advanced systems to refresh air while still submerged, and overall refined designs, these were the first submarines intended to be able to remain submerged for most of the duration of their time at sea. As such, they marked a massive shift in naval warfare, and the ascendancy of submarines to being true terrors. Such warships offered the ability to dominate the oceans to those nations that developed and deployed them."

### Non-MTG Hulls ### 

### Destroyers ###

destroyer_1:0 "Weltkrieg Destroyer"
destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg brought a new demand for destroyers- not only were they required to protect their fleets, but they were also stretched thin to protect the Entente shipping lines as well. To meet this need, destroyer designs were streamlined, entering mass production to keep up with demand. Ships of this era were typically 1000 tons, and travelled at a top speed of 34 knots, while carrying a larger pair of torpedoes than their forebears."
destroyer_2:0 "Improved Destroyer"
destroyer_2_desc:0 "By 1935, with increasingly potent new aircraft designs entering service, as well as several navies deploying fleet carriers, while there was still some doubt about just how useful the carriers would be in open warfare, concern over the potential threat that aircraft might pose to warships was growing. German carrier operations during the Chinese intervention and continued British exercises had shown the world that the carrier had a purpose in the navy. As a result, this era of destroyer saw the introduction of the dual purpose primary armament, granting a vastly improved anti-aircraft role to the destroyer, again increasing their usefulness. Theses ships would displace up to 2,500 tons, often carrying increased payloads of torpedoes to offset the reduced torpedo load-out on more modern cruisers."
destroyer_3:0 "Advanced Destroyer"
destroyer_3_desc:0 "With the start of the Second Weltkrieg the world's navies needed cheap anti-aircraft platforms. The British success with carrier combat had shown the world that they were suited for more than just recon and anti-carrier duties, they were required for modern anti-capital ship warfare. Advanced anti-submarine technologies like the new hedgehog depth charges were playing an essential role in combating the major threat to convoy operations, they and the anti-aircraft platforms intensified demands for more destroyers. Were previously destroyer investments were being lowered in favour of cruisers and the new armoured cruisers, destroyers began to return to the fore as an essential part of both the fleet, and the convoy system. While often not larger than their predecessors they were far more technologically advanced, mostly adopting flush decks and far larger torpedo armaments."
destroyer_4:0 "Modern Destroyer"
destroyer_4_desc:0 "Near the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the navies of the world were forced to adapt to new submarines that could stay submerged for almost indefinite periods of time, carriers were loaded full of planes more than capable of destroying capital ships, and big gun cruisers were quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of carriers and submarines. The future role of the escort for the main fleet was being taken over almost solely by destroyers in the minds of most naval theorists, with dual purpose rapid firing turrets destroying any planes that dare cross her path in an attempt to dive bomb her. The displacement of these vessels rose as well, often coming up to 3,000 tons as designers loaded them with more and more anti-aircraft weapons, as well as more primary guns."

interwar_cruiser_nonmtg_desc:0 "The interwar period saw refinements of larger cruisers that had appeared since the Dreadnought Race. With politics and finances still constraining many naval powers, the designs produced were only marginally larger in size than the previous generation, instead seeing upgrades in firepower through the use of eight inch guns or the growing adoption of triple turrets and quadruple torpedo tubes. With the importance of aircraft growing in naval warfare, anti-aircraft armament was also considered, leading to the adoption of high-angle dual-purpose mounts for three-five inch guns, supplemented by a growing array of autocannons."
advanced_cruiser_nonmtg:0 "Advanced Cruiser"
advanced_cruiser_nonmtg_desc:0 "Thanks to increased available funding, the new cruisers built at the end of the interwar period and the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg saw another slight growth in their size. Once more, while the the primary armament's calibre remained, with few exceptions, in the 7-8 inch range, their firepower was increased further by adding an extra turret or raising the number of guns in each turret if that had not been done in the previous generation. Secondary armaments were further upgraded with further twin dual-purpose guns and even more dedicated anti-aircraft armament, often linked with improved fire controls. This generation also saw the growing adoption of radar systems on cruisers."

With air power confirmed to be one of the greatest threats to ships, designers focused on improving AA capabilities even further through better fire-control, improving coordination between batteries and radar. Some navies also experimented with autoloading mechanisms for the main armament, dramatically improving their rates of fire. The rapid pace of rocket and missile development would eventually prove to be the demise of all-gun ships, including cruisers, making this the last generation of 'old type' cruisers for numerous navies."

### Armoured Cruisers ###

armored_cruiser_1:0 "Weltkrieg Armoured Cruiser"
armored_cruiser_1_desc:0 "In the wake of the Revolution in France, the republican government was left deeply concerned about the shipbuilding capabilities of the Commune. Lacking any real ship production facilities and possessing a limited budget, they were forced to place orders internationally, with the now empty naval yards of the Two Sicilies. Their design was intended as an intermediate class, with the guns and range to fight older battleships on their own terms as well as the speed to chase down lighter cruisers and escape the more modern battleships they had no chance of beating themselves. Quickly nations such as Ukraine, Austria, and the Two Sicilies received several orders for more ships of this variety, saving the shipbuilding facilities and experience these nations could no longer afford to sustain, and seeing a burst in construction at the birth of this new design type."
armored_cruiser_2:0 "Improved Armoured Cruiser"
armored_cruiser_2_desc:0 "After the initial wave of armoured cruiser orders from second-rate powers across the world, the design was thoroughly inspected for improvement potential. Better rangefinders were implemented, improvements in triple barreled turret designs were made to reduce weight and improve armour, and additional space was made for more floatplanes to be added to improve the recon ability of the ship. This new generation of designs was widely adopted by South America, where a second naval race had begun to fracture national budgets, as rich nations like Venezuela poured wealth into improving their fleets in the wake of the Chilean revolution."
armored_cruiser_3:0 "Advanced Armoured Cruiser"
armored_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Progress in Armoured Cruiser design came with a revaluation of the role of these ships, and with adjustments in the trajectory of previous developments. While they retained the mediocre armour of their predecessors, these ships changed course on the path of their guns, generally moving to reduce barrel diameter in favour of gun designs with increased velocity. Most were armed with six main guns, in double or triple turrets, and most of those guns were 11-12 inches or equivalent."
armored_cruiser_4:0 "Modern Armoured Cruiser"
armored_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The evolution of the armoured cruiser, by the mid-1940s, had reached its apex: ships with the speed to hunt cruisers but the firepower to threaten true capital warships enough to keep them on their toes. While the firepower of the ships was less useful with the rise of the Carrier, they found great use in shore bombardment and carrier escort duties. Functionally greatly enlarged cruisers with much heavier armour and guns, most of these ships were armed with six to nine main guns of 11-12 inch or equivalent size; these were extremely high velocity gun designs, allowing for the armour penetration and range to engage battleships respectably while also functioning as an effective lone convoy raider more than capable of dealing with escorting destroyers and lighter cruisers."

### Battleships ###

battleship_1:0 "Weltkrieg Battleship"
battleship_1_desc:0 "Designed shortly before the Weltkrieg began, and completed while it raged, these classes represented the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and would remain highly potent long after it ended. While they were notably faster than the Dreadnoughts before them their most notable differentiating feature was their escalated armament- they carried eight to ten main guns, of 14 to 15 inch or equivalent, most in twin turrets but a few in new triple turrets. Their devastating firepower and heavy armour guaranteed that they would be at the heart of their battle fleets, but those continued advances came at quickly escalating prices. Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."
battleship_2:0 "Improved Battleship"
battleship_2_desc:0 "The end of the Dreadnought Race, with the start of the British Revolution, led to large scale naval construction largely ceasing, and naval funding, which had grown to enormous levels in the period up to 1925, finally collapsing. The 'Great Powers' spent the next decade slowly finishing ships already under construction, while focusing development on smaller ships that were easier to slip through the naval budgets. It wasn't until the early 30s that the Great Powers began to experiment with fast battleship designs. These battleship designs were far more modern, with improved rangefinders, powerful oil fired engines, and 16 to 18 inch guns, but were generally iterative, focusing more on delivering a powerful ship at the best price rather than being a drastic improvement over their predecessors."
battleship_3:0 "Advanced Battleship"
battleship_3_desc:0 "With the Second Weltkrieg on the horizon and international tensions higher than ever, designers were looking to construct a new generation of ships to fight in the upcoming war. While some nations had transitioned their naval hopes to carriers, others still insisted that the carrier could only provide a supplementary role, rather than replacing the primary anti-capital ship role of the battleship. These nations, typified by Germany, instead retooled their newer designs, focusing on improved armour layouts and more effective guns and turrets, as well as improved speeds."
battleship_4:0 "Modern Battleship"
battleship_4_desc:0 "At the close of the Second Weltkrieg, the Great Powers were faced with an indisputable fact: naval air power had proved victorious over all gun capital ships. However, several nations persisted with the development of Battleships, as shore bombardment platforms, prestige projects and support for carriers within the fleet. Designers loaded their battleships with anti-aircraft batteries, as well as the latest anti-aircraft rocket technology. These designs would prove less than successful over the years; while many of these battleships would continue to be operated well into the 70s, they were widely viewed as obsolete, and mostly functioned to ferry Heads of State on national voyages and to occasionally provide shore bombardment support during regional conflicts."

### Dreadnoughts ###

dreadnought_1:0 "Dreadnought"
dreadnought_1_desc:0 "As the Dreadnought Race reached its height, these true monsters were conceived. Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost was staggering, and few nations could afford to even consider constructing them. Nonetheless, those that did found themselves in possession of truly mighty weapons of naval supremacy. Even more so than the generation before them, they suffered from the conditions of their conception. Rushed design work, last minute and improvised redesigns during construction, shortages of the huge amount of resources they required, immense pressure to rush construction, and the sheer size and complexity of their massive mechanisms, all led to design flaws and vulnerabilities beneath their vast armoured hides. These designs were armed with twelve to fifteen 18 inch or equivalent main guns."
dreadnought_2:0 "Improved Dreadnought"
dreadnought_2_desc:0 "Once the afterglow of the great Dreadnought Race had faded away, naval designers took stock of the position of dreadnoughts in future planning. Discarding speed as a major goal, with the understanding that the new generation of so-called 'fast battleships' would assume that task, these designs instead focused on extreme, unprecedented, armour protection. Advanced 16 inch guns could equal the armour penetration of 18 inches, while being less expensive. .Drawing lessons from the navies possessing heavy ordinance most of these designs were armed with those types of advanced 16 inch guns, or equivalents, normally arranged in five triple turrets."
dreadnought_3:0 "Advanced Dreadnought"
dreadnought_3_desc:0 "Even as most navies, with varying degrees of reluctance and dismay, were forced to concede the ascendancy of carriers over traditional gun warships, some naval designers still dreamed of creating the 'ultimate battleship'. Girded in nearly impenetrable armour, bristling with anti-aircraft batteries, and armed with six triple 16 inch turrets or equivalent extreme armament, these designs represented the very pinnacle of heavy warship design. Conceived in the twilight of the age of gun warships, these designs were seen as obsolete even before their drafting was completed, mainly by the advocates of ascendant airpower."

### Carriers ###

carrier_1:0 "Experimental Carrier"
carrier_1_desc:0 "Having learned from the experience of using seaplane tenders, those navies with the resources to do so began work on the next generation of ships that could carry aircraft at sea. Unlike their predecessors, these carriers were designed with flight decks to allow for aircraft to both fly off of them and to then return and land on them. Converted from civilian ships and seaplane tenders, most of these ships were limited by having relatively cramped flight decks and hangars, but they definitely demonstrated that ships were capable of effectively operating air complements at sea."
carrier_2:0 "Improved Carrier"
carrier_2_desc:0 "Developed in the late 30s, these ships were designed to provide aerial reconnaissance and light fighter coverage for fleets primarily focused on more 'conventional' warship forces. Their range was significantly increased, and efforts were made to make them fast enough to keep up with fleets operating at full speed in open oceans."
carrier_3:0 "Advanced Carrier"
carrier_3_desc:0 "As major naval combat operations in the naval aviation age demonstrated the power of aircraft to seriously affect battles at sea, many powers found themselves having fallen behind in the development of their carrier forces. While fleet carriers were quickly shown to be the most potent of their kin, they were also massive ships that required a long time and large amount of resources to construct. In the rush to increase their ability to project air power into the oceans, several powers turned to designs like these, enlarged versions of the existing lighter carriers, to try to quickly bolster their naval aviation capacity."
carrier_4:0 "Modern Light Carrier"
carrier_4_desc:0 "Even once the dominance of fleet carriers had become indisputable, there were many powers that could not afford such ships, and even major naval powers that needed secondary carriers to cover less important naval regions. These ships were the designs that were created to fill those needs. Much smaller than the fleet carriers, they nonetheless incorporated design innovations developed from them, to produce effective smaller carriers that had respectable aircraft capacity, fast speeds, and reasonable anti-aircraft defence batteries."
heavy_carrier_1:0 "Experimental Fleet Carrier"
heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "The first fleet carriers designed entirely to be such, most of these ships were significantly smaller than their converted dreadnought predecessors, but, due to being intentionally centred on the requirements of naval aviation, were also far more reliable in that role. With better anti-aircraft defenses and properly designed runways, they generally carried around sixty aircraft."
heavy_carrier_2:0 "Modern Fleet Carrier"
heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "Continued development of fleet carrier design led to much larger models, these ships approached the size of the first fleet carriers, while incorporating all of the design improvements made in the intervening years. Most had significant armour protection and withering AA firepower, while also being highly mechanically reliable. However, they had given up their large calibre secondary armament in exchange for dual purpose 100-127mm guns. Their general aircraft capacity was, on average, around eighty."

### Submarines ###

submarine_1:0 "Weltkrieg Submarine"
submarine_1_desc:0 "The first submersible warships actually capable of effective combat actions, these designs were significant improvements over their predecessors. With diesel-electric engines replacing the primarily petrol-electric engines of the first submarines, they had greatly improved range and surface speed. In combat with enemy warships, they acted mainly as submersible light torpedo boats, but lacked the submerged speed or endurance to remain underwater for more than relatively brief periods. These were the submarines that were used by the major naval powers during the Weltkrieg."
submarine_2:0 "Improved Submarine"
submarine_2_desc:0 "The evolution of the 'cruiser' submarine designs, some of these warships took those ideas further, with larger guns and a greater emphasis on surface abilities, while others began to look in the other direction, seeking to increase underwater capabilities and performance."
submarine_3:0 "Advanced Submarine"
submarine_3_desc:0 "The gains made by some earlier designs in extending underwater range, speed, and overall abilities, led to the turn in submarine development away from 'cruiser' types and back towards vessels with a greater emphasis on underwater capabilities. Vastly improved over earlier types, these submarines carried potent payloads of torpedoes and were a legitimate threat to almost all surface ships. However, they were still limited in submerged duration, range, and speed, and remained vulnerable when surfaced, especially to aircraft."
submarine_4:0 "Modern Submarine"
submarine_4_desc:0 "With greatly increased battery capacity, advanced systems to refresh air while still submerged, and overall refined designs, these were the first submarines intended to be able to remain submerged for most of the duration of their time at sea. As such, they marked a massive shift in naval warfare, and the ascendancy of submarines to being true terrors. Such warships offered the ability to dominate the oceans to those nations that developed and deployed them."
cruiser_submarine_1:0 "Cruiser Submarine"
cruiser_submarine_1_desc:0 "Significantly larger than preceding submarines,these designs were of 'cruiser' type, designed for long-range independent operations in commerce raiding and intended to be better equipped to handle combat with enemy light warships while surfaced. As such, they carried heavier gun armament, and had improved surface speed. Their submerged capabilities, however, remained limited."

### Other ###
ship_hull_superdreadnought:0 "Dreadnought"
ship_hull_superdreadnought_desc:0 "The rapid increase of resources devoted to naval construction after the end of major land conflict during the Weltkrieg initially produced these designs, which featured the beginnings of the trends towards sudden growth in size, firepower, armour, calibre and of course, cost. Such vessels set the world's leading naval powers apart from the mere pretenders to greatness, but they had their issues; their rapid development and rushed construction led to design flaws and persistent mechanical problems. These designs were armed with eight to ten 18 inch or equivalent main guns, and had the protection to go toe-to-toe with similarly armed ships. As the Dreadnought Race reached its height, these true monsters were conceived. Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost was staggering, and few nations could afford to even consider constructing them. Nonetheless, those that did found themselves in possession of truly mighty weapons of naval supremacy. Even more so than the generation before them, they suffered from the conditions of their conception. Rushed design work, last minute and improvised redesigns during construction, shortages of the huge amount of resources they required, immense pressure to rush construction, and the sheer size and complexity of their massive mechanisms, all led to design flaws and vulnerabilities beneath their vast armoured hides. These designs were armed with twelve to fifteen 18 inch or equivalent main guns."
