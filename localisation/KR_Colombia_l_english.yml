col.1.t:0 "Colombia's Place in the World"
col.1.d:0 "Weakened by civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), Colombia had to acknowledge U.S. rights of control of the Panamá Canal in the Hay-Bunan-Varilla Treaty of 1903, ending the conflict between the two countries about the building of the Canal. When the Colombian Congress denied to ratify the treaty the United States forced the secession of Panamá from Colombia, compensating them between 1921 and 1930 with a payment of a total 25 million Dollars. Colombia formally recognised Panamá in 1921. The conservatives pursued the modernisation of the country, expanding the railroad network. Since 1850 Colombia had been exporting tobacco, after 1900 coffee and bananas were added (with the aid of U.S. capital), after 1905 petroleum. The liberals formed a government in 1930 which enacted a land reform, dispossessing big landowners, and social reforms, with economic benefits for the middle class, the workers' class and the peasants."
col.1.a:0 "Whatever the future holds, we stand united."
col.2.t:0 "The 1938 Presidential Election: Colombia at a Crossroads"
col.2.d:0 "This year's Presidential election has begun and while it's predicted that the Liberal Party will continue control of the Presidency, the Conservative party can just as well win the post. More extreme factions from both sides have splintered and are also running mainly the socialist UNIR led by the charismatic Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, and sporadic violence between them and the right have emerged. From the sidelines, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, fresh returned from his trip to Mitteleuropa to secure defence contracts, worryingly believes that the very fabric of the Republic may be at risk..."
col.2.a:0 "The Liberals win it!"
col.2.b:0 "The Conservatives win it!"
col.2.c:0 "Jorge Gaitán sways the masses, and the UNIR and other radical liberals form a majority!"
col.2.e:0 "The Youth Conservative coalition, led by the Corporatist Leopardos, takes a surprise win!"
col.2.f:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy! Order must be restored."
col.3.t:0 "The 1942 Presidential Election"
col.3.d:0 "With the democratic establishment of Colombia strengthened, Gaitan and other hardline liberals fell into Party line, and the Leopardos lost their momentum. Now, the people of Colombia must choose their president, and either party can just as well win the post..."
col.3.a:0 "The Liberals win it!"
col.3.b:0 "The Conservatives win it!"
col.3.f:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy! Order must be restored."
col.4.t:0 "The 1946 Presidential Election"
col.4.d:0 "Will this election bring us more unity or will it divide further?"
col.4.a:0 "The Liberals, the only true way to rule."
col.4.b:0 "The Conservatives will lead the way."
col.4.c:0 "For the peasants, for the workers and for Colombia - Choose the Syndicalists."
col.5.t:0 "Colombian Ultimatum"
col.5.d:0 "The government of 'Gran' Colombia has issued an Ultimatum! They demand we join the Gran Colombian federation, or be declared Syndicalists and enemies of the state. What should we do?"
col.5.a:0 "We have no choice, their armies are too vast. For the good of the people, we surrender."
col.5.b:0 "Ecuador will not submit! To Arms!"
col.6.t:0 "Ecuador Folds"
col.6.d_1:0 "Ecuador has folded, and a jovial mood has swept our nation! Alas, it seems that the imperialists who consider themselves Ecuador's overlord are none to pleased with this outcome - shocked indeed that Ecuador would fold even with their military backing. We must now prepare for potential conflict over the matter."
col.6.d_2:0 "Rather than allow thousands of brothers to die in the battlefield, Ecuador has joined us peacefully"
col.6.a:0 "As planned."
col.7.t:0 "Ecuador Refuses!"
col.7.d:0 "Utter lunacy seems to have taken a grip of the Quito government, for they now are taking arms against us, considering our generous offer a threat"
col.7.a:0 "They choose... poorly."
col.8.t:0 "Colombian Ultimatum"
col.8.d:0 "The government of 'Gran' Colombia has issued an Ultimatum! They demand we join the Gran Colombian federation, or be declared imperialists and enemies of the state. What should we do?"
col.8.a:0 "We have no choice, their armies are too vast. For the good of the people, we surrender."
col.8.b:0 "Venezuela will never submit to such vile threats! To Arms!"
col.9.t:0 "Venezuela Folds"
col.9.d_1:0 "Venezuela has folded, and a jovial mood has swept our nation! Alas, it seems that the imperialists who consider themselves Venezuela's overlord are none to pleased with this outcome - shocked indeed that Venezuela would fold even with their military backing. We must now prepare for potential conflict over the matter."
col.9.d_2:0 "Rather than allow thousands of brothers to die in the battlefield, Venezuela has joined us peacefully"
col.9.a:0 "As planned."
col.10.t:0 "Venezuela Refuses!"
col.10.d:0 "Utter lunacy seems to have taken a grip of the Caracas government, for they now are taking arms against us, considering our generous offer a threat"
col.10.a:0 "They must be drinking oil! To Arms!"
col.11.t:0 "Colombian Ultimatum"
col.11.d:0 "The government of 'Gran' Colombia has issued an Ultimatum! They demand that Panamá joins the Gran Colombia, else a state of war between our countries will begin. What should we do?"
col.11.a:0 "We have no choice, their armies are too vast. For the good of the people, we surrender."
col.11.b:0 "We will never submit to such vile threats! To Arms!"
col.12.t:0 "Panamá Joins the Federation"
col.12.d_1:0 "Panamá has folded, and a jovial mood has swept our nation! Alas, it seems that the imperialists who consider themselves Panamá's overlord are none to pleased with this outcome - shocked indeed that Panamá would fold even with their military backing. We must now prepare for potential conflict over the matter."
col.12.d_2:0 "Rather than be crushed by our might, the imperialists folded and Panamá belongs to us again"
col.12.a:0 "As planned."
col.13.t:0 "Ultimatum Refused!"
col.13.d:0 "Yet again, the fake country of Panamá stands between Colombia and progress. They will live to pay for their mistakes!"
col.13.a:0 "They will be crushed!"
col.14.t:0 "A Stable Democracy"
col.14.d:0 "Our victory in the next election is guaranteed, some ask if it will even happen. They do grant us an air of extra legitimacy. However, we should extend an olive branch to the moderate Liberales, who clearly didn't know better than to join our coalition beforehand. Such an alliance will vastly expand our political clout"
col.14.a:0 "All are welcome in this government for all Colombians."
col.14.b:0 "The people love us, not the Liberales. They can enjoy the sidelines!"
col.15.t:0 "The Final Blow"
col.15.d:0 "Colombian democracy is dead. The streets are silent, no more fighting, discussions or debates. Only the sound of marching in the distance, and the Leopardo salute. We finally can get rid of the old constitution and formalise our Junta as... permanent"
col.15.a:0 "Colombia will be reorganised into the Greater Colombian Authority."
col.15.b:0 "Such drastic measures may alarm the people."
col.16.t:0 "Colombia Proposes an Alliance"
col.16.d:0 "The Colombians have sent us an offer to ally with them. How we should respond?"
col.16.a:0 "Sign it!"
col.16.b:0 "Reject the offer."
col.17.t:0 "Venezuela Accepts!"
col.17.d:0 "Venezuela accepted to join our Pact, if only to keep itself safe from Peruvian attacks"
col.17.a:0 "Liberty and safety."
col.18.t:0 "Colombia Proposes an Alliance?"
col.18.d:0 "The Colombians, seeing the nervous atmosphere between us and Peru, have invited us to form an alliance. What is our decision?"
col.18.a:0 "Sign it!"
col.18.b:0 "Reject the offer."
col.19.t:0 "Ecuador Accepts!"
col.19.d:0 "Ecuador accepted to join our Pact, if only to keep itself safe from Peruvian attacks"
col.19.a:0 "Liberty and safety."
col.20.t:0 "Colombia Annexes Ecuador"
col.20.d:0 "In a shocking move, Colombia secretly moved much of its armed forces to the Ecuadoran border, obviously pre-empting an invasion, and demanded Ecuador's annexation. It seems that even our military protection was not enough to dissuade the cowardly Ecuadorans from caving to Colombian demands.\nWhile under normal circumstances we would even consider letting this slight pass unanswered, given the current tumultuous state of the world, we must consider how to respond to Colombia."
col.20.a:0 "To War!"
col.20.b:0 "Let Them Have It."

It seems that even our military protection was not enough to dissuade the cowardly Panamánians from caving to Colombian demands.\nWhile under normal circumstances we would even consider letting this slight pass unanswered, given the current tumultuous state of the world, we must consider how to respond to Colombia."
