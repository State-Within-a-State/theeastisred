LU_XUN_DESC:0 "Lu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, on 25th of September 1881. Lu sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans. At school was Lu's first exposure to foreign literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. In 1902 he would leave China to study in Japan, in which he would cut off his queue and become interested with revolutionary Chinese politics. In February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution that ended the Qing dynasty and nominally founded the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. In 1917, an old friend of Lu's, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for New Youth, a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. After the publication of Diary of a Madman, the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. He would write for the magezine til 1921. Even though Lu Xun worked in 'New Youth', he didn't become a CBP(Chinese Bolshevik Party founded by Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu )member, but would at times stay away from the internal arguments of the party. In 1921 Chen split from the CBP and formed the CSP. Lu would later leave the CBP and New Youth(Now a CSP paper) and move to the Legation Cities. In 1925 he would meet young Shanghai socialists and form the League of Leftwing Writers. The group would be advocates for socialist realism, but by 1935 there was clear factional lines occurring between Lu and other League Members. As 1936 many are concerned for Lu's health as his health seems to get worse."

POLITICS_DESC_QU_QIUBAI:0 "Qu Qiubai was born in Changzhou, Jiangsu, in 1899. When Qu was young, his family lived in his uncle's house and was supported financially by relatives. Though Qu's father took a job as teacher, he was not able to support his family due to his addiction to opium. In 1915, Qu's mother, overcome by her life's mounting difficulties and debts, committed suicide. In 1916, Qu went to Hankou and entered Wuchang Foreign Language School to learn English with the support of his cousin. In the spring of 1917, Qu went to Peking to apply for a job, but did not pass the general civil service examination. Not having enough money to pay for a regular university tuition, Qu enrolled in the newly established Russian Language Institute under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since it did not require payment of fee. The institute also offered a stipend and promised him a job upon graduation. As the October waged on in Russia, Qu would study Russian communism and be enthused by it. Even when the Bolsheviks failed, he still kept hope in the Russian system, as well as started to become infactuated with the ideas of Mayakovsky, in which would find him align under Mayakovsky's ideas. He would stick with his mentor Li Dazhao after the syndicalist split. Since viewing syndicalism with a view of disgust. After the dissolution of the Chinese Bolshevik Party, Qu Qiubai would live in Shanghai, where he met Lu Xun, who introduced him to the League of Leftwing Writers. Qu would become a major figure in the league in the next few years, with him forming his own faction in support of Mayakovskyvite ideas."

lu_xun.1.desc:0 "As Black Monday consumed the Legation Cities, the cities fill with protests and strikes that last for days on end. as protests and strikes grow, every city with in the Legations goes into daily street battles. At the helm of this is the League of Left-Wing Writers, headed by Lu Xun, a prominent writer who has gain famed amongst the world but specifically gained fame around all of China for his anti-Qing, anti-monarchist, anti imperialist and anti feudalist writings. With his leadership of the League, he leads the group in the direction of organizing and perusing revolution in Shanghai and all across China.\n\nAs the Legation governing offices are seized by the workers, a new revolution is declared in which Lu Xun reads out in a speech in Shanghai that the Legations Cities are no more and that China shall break the chains of slavery for it to be free."
lu_xun.2.desc:0 "As the clocks hands move time slows down. From the last few days our leader and idol, Lu Xun has been unwell from cancer, potentially caused by his habit of chain smoking. For the past few days the communal council has taken control of his political duties. Lu Xun's health state though has been rapidly deteriorating, with him now being more unable to talk, eat or breathe.  Then as the clock hits midnight Lu Xun was pronounced dead. In the next few days, his funeral is hosted throughout the revolution communities of the Shanghai movement, with a  national day of mourning declared. But as his death envelops the country and possibly the whole world, the factionalism from the communal council grows, with now the formation of a new power struggle between 4 factions. The center by Qu Qiubai, the Creationists led by Guo Moruo and Yu Dafu, the radical agrarians controlled by Zhang Chungqiao & Kang Sheng, and the Gang of 3 (Ruo Shu, Ding Ling & Zhou Yang)."
lu_xun.3.desc:0 "Days after the loss of our revolutionary leader/comrade, a funeral is hosted in Shanghai by the League of Leftwing Writers, workers march in solidarity as a major crowd gathers, as his coffin goes by. But its not just the locals that mourn for him, there are also some international guests who have admired Lu Xun for his ideas and works. For a brief moment it seems like the Chinese left is united, but it certainly isn't, especially added that factionalism with in the league is rising. Now that they have laid the coffin to rest, a eulogy is read. The speaker of this eulogy would greatly push forward their faction's power with in the league. The eulogy is read by..."
lu_xun.4.desc:0 "After the funeral of Lu Xun, the delegates of the League meet in Shanghai to discuss future leadership of the revolution, in which a background on factionalism plays louder and louder. First called out were the names of the faction leaders, aka the Central Committee, Kang Sheng; Zhang Chunqiao; Qu Quibai; Guo Moruo; Yu Dafu; Ding Ling; Zhou Yang; and Ruo Shi. Each faction is now poised at seizing power. The question is...Who shall succeed?"
lu_xun.5.desc:0 "National Literature has become a big topic within the league in recent years, in reference to the growing expansionism of Japan and other Imperialist powers. One idea proposed by Zhou Yang is that we are all Chinese and we should unite as one to defeat our common enemy of European-Japanese imperialism. This is called 'National Defence Literature'. Though seen as nationalistic by some, this idea put forward by Zhou Yang, reveals an ugly side of Zhou, which is more sectarian side, which could come back to haunt him in future. On the other hand other members like Guo Moruo are promoting ideas called 'Revolutionary Promotion Literature' in which we must ignore aligning reactionaries to defeat others and that we have enough support to launch a revolution and crush japan. The whole incident was showing behavior from Zhou Yang that got him slightly ostracized by others, due to how aggressive and openly sectarian he was being."
lu_xun.6.desc:0 "Since the victory of our revolution, we have been trying to recover from the economic disaster that caused our revolution in the first place. all the ideas put forward are based of Marx and Lenin principles, whilst maybe also having some syndicalist influences. The first idea, proposed by Zhang Chunqiao and Kang Sheng is the formation of People's Communes and also a large focus on supporting the peasants economically for greater popular support across China, similar ideas have been echoed by Zhou Yang and the Student Unions, as most of their members come from peasant background. Mean while the Creation Society and Qu Quibai promote a technocratic socialist approach to the economy, and want to focus on the urban proletariat whilst still tending to the peasants."
lu_xun.7.desc:0 "Throughout the Legation Cities, multiple churches and religious institutions have been setup, as well as the new religious movements that also are in other regions of China. One side the Agrarian Faction, and the Creation Society want to eliminate religion straight way, as it is a reactionary force that corrupts and limits the minds of the masses, as to serve the bourgeoisie and that the idea of religion might as well be compared to Opium, as to reference Marx. the Students whole a view similar but rather get rid of religion though gradual and peaceful means as to not completely have a possibility of angering the masses. Finally is Qu Quibai who wants to remove some religions (Like Christianity, & Islam), in replacing them with Atheism, but also wanting to allow Buddhism to exist with in the nation, in relation to he younger socialist days."
lu_xun.8.desc:0 "After days of voting, the congress final ends, where the congress sings the International, with joy and tears, as they celebrate the new coming for the Chinese revolution but also mourn the loss of their dear comrade (Lu Xun). The congress has announced the new leader of the Shanghai Commue."
shanghai_revolution.0.desc:0 "As the world reaches the nightmares of Black Monday, we ourselves suffer a major economic blow caused by the collapse of world markets, as due to the Shanghai concessions relying on the Berlin stock exchange. With this subsequent major economic loss to the citizens of Shanghai, troubles starts to brew with in the workers, in which is caused by the recent loss of pay and newly deteriorating conditions for them. Its been a few days since Black Monday, but the worse is yet to come as strike action has been called by multiple trade unions throughout Shanghai. Now the in all the cities of the legations face the issue of worker strike action. Time will tell what will happen next...."
shanghai_revolution.1.desc:0 "As we still gather ourselves from the disaster of Black Monday, the strikes have continued to grow in the legation cities. Now we are faced with a choice on how to deal with the exponentially growing unrest, on whether to call in help from the major powers or to rely on the criminal underworld to crackdown upon the dissidents. We eagerly wait for the decision of the legations board."
shanghai_revolution.2.desc:0 "Despite our efforts to contain the strikes with the use of gangs it seems they are overpowered by the shear number of strikers at hand. With this plethora of chaos surrounding is, we wonder, who is behind all this?\nIt is Lu Xun, a prolific Chinese writer and leader of the League of Left Wing Writers. Though silent in the first few days of the strike, he has come out to speak against the legation government's use of brutal force at the hand of the triads. Now we see the next actions of his bequest in his mission to overthrow the Legation Cities."
shanghai_revolution.3.desc:0 "As per a few days since the discovery of the mastermind behind this mess, a new wave of strike action has started to unfold, in which the rebels (as what we now call them by ) start to push back our police and gang allies but physically fighting back with first sticks and stone but now with guns and swords. This move  has now convinced the legations leadership to flee the legations and enter the safe havens of their respective countries."
shanghai_uprisings.0.desc:0 "As night falls over the China, the calm before the storm hits the reactionaries of Nanjing, before the fire touches the gasoline and starts a fire that shall see a new China reborn from the ashes. Soldiers in Jinhua, Huaisi and Nanjing provinces  are unaware of what is going on. After months of preparation and training our urban and rural militias arise up in revolt  in these provinces, capturing large swaths of Jinhua, Huaisi and Nanjing. The reactionary Nanjing government escapes just moments before their capital is captured by the revolutionaries. Now as the uprising has begun, we shall fight for socialism in China and crush the Nanjing reactionaries."
