LU_XUN_DESC:0 "Lu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, on 25th of September 1881. Lu sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans. At school was Lu's first exposure to foreign literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. In 1902 he would leave China to study in Japan, in which he would cut off his queue and become interested with revolutionary Chinese politics. In February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution that ended the Qing dynasty and nominally founded the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. In 1917, an old friend of Lu's, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for New Youth, a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. After the publication of Diary of a Madman, the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. He would write for the magezine til 1921. Even though Lu Xun worked in 'New Youth', he didn't become a CBP(Chinese Bolshevik Party founded by Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu )member, but would at times stay away from the internal arguments of the party. In 1921 Chen split from the CBP and formed the CSP. Lu would later leave the CBP and New Youth(Now a CSP paper) and move to the Legation Cities. In 1925 he would meet young Shanghai socialists and form the League of Leftwing Writers. The group would be advocates for socialist realism, but by 1935 there was clear factional lines occurring between Lu and other League Members. As 1936 many are concerned for Lu's health as his health seems to get worse."
POLITICS_SHANGHAI_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "After the storm and victory of the Shanghai revolution, an intermediate government as been setup under the guidance of our fallen comrade Lu Xun, and now since he has passed, the council shall remane in charge whilst its member claw for power of the Shanghai Commune."

Though Qu's father took a job as teacher, he was not able to support his family due to his addiction to opium. In 1915, Qu's mother, overcome by her life's mounting difficulties and debts, committed suicide. In 1916, Qu went to Hankou and entered Wuchang Foreign Language School to learn English with the support of his cousin. In the spring of 1917, Qu went to Peking to apply for a job, but did not pass the general civil service examination. Not having enough money to pay for a regular university tuition, Qu enrolled in the newly established Russian Language Institute under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since it did not require payment of fee. The institute also offered a stipend and promised him a job upon graduation. As the October waged on in Russia, Qu would study Russian communism and be enthused by it. Even when the Bolsheviks failed, he still kept hope in the Russian system, as well as started to become infactuated with the ideas of Mayakovsky, in which would find him align under Mayakovsky's ideas. He would stick with his mentor Li Dazhao after the syndicalist split. Since viewing syndicalism with a view of disgust. After the dissolution of the Chinese Bolshevik Party, Qu Qiubai would live in Shanghai, where he met Lu Xun, who introduced him to the League of Leftwing Writers. Qu would become a major figure in the league in the next few years, with him forming his own faction in support of Mayakovskyvite ideas."
POLITICS_DESC_YU_DAFU:0 "Yu was born in Fuyang, Zhejiang province. His father died when he was three, leaving the family poverty-stricken and destitute. He received a number of scholarships through the Chinese government and went on to receive a traditional Chinese education in Hangzhou. In 1912, he entered Hangchow University  for a short period before he was expelled for participation in a student strike. He then moved to Japan, where he studied economics at the Tokyo Imperial University between 1913 and 1921, where he met other Chinese intellectuals who together created the Creation Society. He return to china in 1923 as a celebrity of sorts. He would later join the Lu Xun and the League in 1927 after the failure of the Creation Society. It was there where he would work with his close comrade Guo Moruo, but he did disagree him Guo on issues like Confucianism. Not to mention also making allies with Qu Qiubai and becoming a social futurist within the league."
POLITICS_DESC_GUO_MORUO:0 "Guo was the eighth child of his mother. Three of his siblings had died before he was born, but more children were born later, so by the time he went to school, he had seven siblings. A few years before Guo was born, his parents retained a private tutor, Shen Huanzhang, to provide education for their children, in the hope of them later passing civil service examinations.  Guo left China in December 1913, reaching Japan in early January 1914. After a year of preparatory study in Tokyo, he entered Sixth Higher School in Okayama. After graduation from the Okayama school, Guo entered in 1918 the Medical School of Kyushu Imperial University in Fukuoka. He was more interested in literature than medicine, however. His studies at this time focused on foreign language and literature, namely the works of: Spinoza, Goethe, Walt Whitman, and the Nobel Laureate Rabindra Nath Tagore. Along with numerous translations, he published his first anthology of poems. He co-founded the Creation Society in 1921, he would briefly join the CBP just before its disbandment along with the Creation Society's disbandment, but would go to Shanghai to adhere under the guide of Lu Xun in 1927. Now a member of the league, Guo starts to make a name for himself and promotes a weird confucian socialist ideas whilst also understanding and advocating for a technocratic socialist state."

lu_xun.1.desc:0 "As Black Monday consumed the Legation Cities, the cities fill with protests and strikes that last for days on end. as protests and strikes grow, every city with in the Legations goes into daily street battles. At the helm of this is the League of Left-Wing Writers, headed by Lu Xun, a prominent writer who has gain famed amongst the world but specifically gained fame around all of China for his anti-Qing, anti-monarchist, anti imperialist and anti feudalist writings. With his leadership of the League, he leads the group in the direction of organizing and perusing revolution in Shanghai and all across China.\n\nAs the Legation governing offices are seized by the workers, a new revolution is declared in which Lu Xun reads out in a speech in Shanghai that the Legations Cities are no more and that China shall break the chains of slavery for it to be free."
lu_xun.2.desc:0 "As the clocks hands move time slows down. From the last few days our leader and idol, Lu Xun has been unwell from cancer, potentially caused by his habit of chain smoking. For the past few days the communal council has taken control of his political duties. Lu Xun's health state though has been rapidly deteriorating, with him now being more unable to talk, eat or breathe.  Then as the clock hits midnight Lu Xun was pronounced dead. In the next few days, his funeral is hosted throughout the revolution communities of the Shanghai movement, with a  national day of mourning declared. But as his death envelops the country and possibly the whole world, the factionalism from the communal council grows, with now the formation of a new power struggle between 4 factions. The center by Qu Qiubai, the Creationists led by Guo Moruo and Yu Dafu, the radical agrarians controlled by Zhang Chungqiao & Kang Sheng, and the Gang of 3 (Ruo Shu, Ding Ling & Zhou Yang)."
lu_xun.3.desc:0 "Days after the loss of our revolutionary leader/comrade, a funeral is hosted in Shanghai by the League of Leftwing Writers, workers march in solidarity as a major crowd gathers, as his coffin goes by. But its not just the locals that mourn for him, there are also some international guests who have admired Lu Xun for his ideas and works. For a brief moment it seems like the Chinese left is united, but it certainly isn't, especially added that factionalism with in the league is rising. Now that they have laid the coffin to rest, a eulogy is read. The speaker of this eulogy would greatly push forward their faction's power with in the league. The eulogy is read by..."
lu_xun.4.desc:0 "After the funeral of Lu Xun, the delegates of the League meet in Shanghai to discuss future leadership of the revolution, in which a background on factionalism plays louder and louder. First called out were the names of the faction leaders, aka the Central Committee, Kang Sheng; Zhang Chunqiao; Qu Quibai; Guo Moruo; Yu Dafu; Ding Ling; Zhou Yang; and Ruo Shi. Each faction is now poised at seizing power. The question is...Who shall succeed?"
lu_xun.5.desc:0 "National Literature has become a big topic within the league in recent years, in reference to the growing expansionism of Japan and other Imperialist powers. One idea proposed by Zhou Yang is that we are all Chinese and we should unite as one to defeat our common enemy of European-Japanese imperialism. This is called 'National Defence Literature'. Though seen as nationalistic by some, this idea put forward by Zhou Yang, reveals an ugly side of Zhou, which is more sectarian side, which could come back to haunt him in future. On the other hand other members like Guo Moruo are promoting ideas called 'Revolutionary Promotion Literature' in which we must ignore aligning reactionaries to defeat others and that we have enough support to launch a revolution and crush japan. The whole incident was showing behavior from Zhou Yang that got him slightly ostracized by others, due to how aggressive and openly sectarian he was being."
lu_xun.6.desc:0 "Since the victory of our revolution, we have been trying to recover from the economic disaster that caused our revolution in the first place. all the ideas put forward are based of Marx and Lenin principles, whilst maybe also having some syndicalist influences. The first idea, proposed by Zhang Chunqiao and Kang Sheng is the formation of People's Communes and also a large focus on supporting the peasants economically for greater popular support across China, similar ideas have been echoed by Zhou Yang and the Student Unions, as most of their members come from peasant background. Mean while the Creation Society and Qu Quibai promote a technocratic socialist approach to the economy, and want to focus on the urban proletariat whilst still tending to the peasants."
lu_xun.7.desc:0 "Throughout the Legation Cities, multiple churches and religious institutions have been setup, as well as the new religious movements that also are in other regions of China. One side the Agrarian Faction, and the Creation Society want to eliminate religion straight way, as it is a reactionary force that corrupts and limits the minds of the masses, as to serve the bourgeoisie and that the idea of religion might as well be compared to Opium, as to reference Marx. the Students whole a view similar but rather get rid of religion though gradual and peaceful means as to not completely have a possibility of angering the masses. Finally is Qu Quibai who wants to remove some religions (Like Christianity, & Islam), in replacing them with Atheism, but also wanting to allow Buddhism to exist with in the nation, in relation to he younger socialist days."

shanghai_socialist_for.1.desc:0 "For centuries, the winds of the great seas of the Nanhai and the Pacific blew to the Middle Kingdom - paying tribute to the great civilisation-state of China. The winds of fate also allowed tens of thousands of Chinese expatriates to seek new fortunes and homes across Asia - building diasporic communities in Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand - everywhere they went, connecting Chinese people far and wide despite regional and cultural differences. Truly, China's place in the world is in Asia.\n\nFor the last century however, this has not been the case. We have been humilaited utterly not only by the Western imperialists who tore apart the nations of the East under their banner of colonialism but also against the Japanese wokou who took advantage of our decaying state to pursue their own imperialistic ambitions. In our absence, the ever-burning cultural hearth of East Asia seemed to dim out and darkness covered our what was once maritime bliss.\n\nNow, things are different. The League of Leftwing Writers have led the Chinese peoples to pursue their salvation from imperialism and in doing so - were able to proclaim a socialist state for China, a new revolutionary and socialist state free of imperialist influences. It is with this strength that the Army, Navy, and Air Force of this new Chinese revolutionary state has been able to liberate and free thousands of our fellow Asian comrades across Southeast Asia. We have even been able to bring the revolution to the far icy reaches of Outer Manchuria, and our forces were able to liberate the Japanese workers from the chains of their tyrannical empire.\n\nIt does not end here. China's reinvigorated strength, China's glorious history, and China's prestige calls for it to play an even larger role in the world. Only China is capable of bringing together the vast Asian peoples under the banner of Pan-Asian anti-imperialism, and it does not stop there. We have created a zone of security stretching from Honolulu to Melbourne and covering every nation from the Pacific Island chains to India. Let the world see and rejoice, for the nightmare and darkness of imperialism has faded away and the Hammer & Sickle of the East rises forth - shining all of the world under its brilliance forevermore!"
shanghai_socialist_for.2.desc:0 "At has arrived where we have liberated and united ourselves to a new era in which we shall show the world what we are made of. We shall unleash our global ambitions. But first we must decide on the alliances that will help our revolution. Do we join the other syndicalists? Or Do we denounce their revisionism and unite Asia on our own?"
