LU_XUN_DESC:0 "Lu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, on 25th of September 1881. Lu sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans. At school was Lu's first exposure to foreign literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. In 1902 he would leave China to study in Japan, in which he would cut off his queue and become interested with revolutionary Chinese politics. In February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution that ended the Qing dynasty and nominally founded the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. In 1917, an old friend of Lu's, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for New Youth, a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. After the publication of Diary of a Madman, the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. He would write for the magezine til 1921. Even though Lu Xun worked in 'New Youth', he didn't become a CBP(Chinese Bolshevik Party founded by Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu )member, but would at times stay away from the internal arguments of the party. In 1921 Chen split from the CBP and formed the CSP. Lu would later leave the CBP and New Youth(Now a CSP paper) and move to the Legation Cities. In 1925 he would meet young Shanghai socialists and form the League of Leftwing Writers. The group would be advocates for socialist realism, but by 1935 there was clear factional lines occurring between Lu and other League Members. As 1936 many are concerned for Lu's health as his health seems to get worse."

lu_xun.1.desc:0 "As Black Monday consumed the Legation Cities, the cities fill with protests and strikes that last for days on end. as protests and strikes grow, every city with in the Legations goes into daily street battles. At the helm of this is the League of Left-Wing Writers, headed by Lu Xun, a prominent writer who has gain famed amongst the world but specifically gained fame around all of China for his anti-Qing, anti-monarchist, anti imperialist and anti feudalist writings. With his leadership of the League, he leads the group in the direction of organizing and perusing revolution in Shanghai and all across China.\n\nAs the Legation governing offices are seized by the workers, a new revolution is declared in which Lu Xun reads out in a speech in Shanghai that the Legations Cities are no more and that China shall break the chains of slavery for it to be free."
lu_xun.2.desc:0 "As the clocks hands move time slows down. From the last few days our leader and idol, Lu Xun has been unwell from cancer, potentially caused by his habit of chain smoking. For the past few days the communal council has taken control of his political duties. Lu Xun's health state though has been rapidly deteriorating, with him now being more unable to talk, eat or breathe.  Then as the clock hits midnight Lu Xun was pronounced dead. In the next few days, his funeral is hosted throughout the revolution communities of the Shanghai movement, with a  national day of mourning declared. But as his death envelops the country and possibly the whole world, the factionalism from the communal council grows, with now the formation of a new power struggle between 4 factions. The center by Qu Qiubai, the Creationists led by Guo Moruo and Yu Dafu, the radical agrarians controlled by Zhang Chungqiao & Kang Sheng, and the Gang of 3 (Ruo Shu, Ding Ling & Zhou Yang)."
shanghai_revolution.0.desc:0 "As the world reaches the nightmares of Black Monday, we ourselves suffer a major economic blow caused by the collapse of world markets, as due to the Shanghai concessions relying on the Berlin stock exchange. With this subsequent major economic loss to the citizens of Shanghai, troubles starts to brew with in the workers, in which is caused by the recent loss of pay and newly deteriorating conditions for them. Its been a few days since Black Monday, but the worse is yet to come as strike action has been called by multiple trade unions throughout Shanghai. Now the in all the cities of the legations face the issue of worker strike action. Time will tell what will happen next...."
shanghai_revolution.1.desc:0 "As we still gather ourselves from the disaster of Black Monday, the strikes have continued to grow in the legation cities. Now we are faced with a choice on how to deal with the exponentially growing unrest, on whether to call in help from the major powers or to rely on the criminal underworld to crackdown upon the dissidents. We eagerly wait for the decision of the legations board."
shanghai_revolution.2.desc:0 "Despite our efforts to contain the strikes with the use of gangs it seems they are overpowered by the shear number of strikers at hand. With this plethora of chaos surrounding is, we wonder, who is behind all this?\nIt is Lu Xun, a prolific Chinese writer and leader of the League of Left Wing Writers. Though silent in the first few days of the strike, he has come out to speak against the legation government's use of brutal force at the hand of the triads. Now we see the next actions of his bequest in his mission to overthrow the Legation Cities."
shanghai_revolution.3.desc:0 "As per a few days since the discovery of the mastermind behind this mess, a new wave of strike action has started to unfold, in which the rebels (as what we now call them by ) start to push back our police and gang allies but physically fighting back with first sticks and stone but now with guns and swords. This move  has now convinced the legations leadership to flee the legations and enter the safe havens of their respective countries."
shanghai_uprisings.0.desc:0 "As night falls over the China, the calm before the storm hits the reactionaries of Nanjing, before the fire touches the gasoline and starts a fire that shall see a new China reborn from the ashes. Soldiers in Jinhua, Huaisi and Nanjing provinces  are unaware of what is going on. After months of preparation and training our urban and rural militias arise up in revolt  in these provinces, capturing large swaths of Jinhua, Huaisi and Nanjing. The reactionary Nanjing government escapes just moments before their capital is captured by the revolutionaries. Now as the uprising has begun, we shall fight for socialism in China and crush the Nanjing reactionaries."

The two leaders promot a more technocratic socialist approach, with Yu Dafu being described as more of a Vperedist and Moruo more of a socialist technocrat. The 3rd faction is the §tAgrarian Revolutionary faction§!, which was formed by Zhang Chunqiao and Kang Sheng who were young shanghai revolutionaries who would go on to read archived reports  from the now disbanded CBP about the works of Mao Zedong, leader of the Xinmin society in Hunan. The faction tries to expand China's socialist revolution by gain support and supporting the peasant majority, and also changing old reactionary culture in favor of new proletarian culture. Finally the final faction is the §MStudent faction§!, a faction formed by what is known in the communal council as the Gang of 3. The first leader is Ruo Shi, who is a loyal follower of Lu Xun ideas and focuses on expanding Lu Xun's idea's to China. Next is Zhou Yang who has opposition to Lu Xun's ideas and rather focus' on ideas that serve as partial inspiration to the §tAgrarian faction§! but also having a major avante guard influence yet also a focus on urbanization.Finally there is Ding Ling, who is a socialist feminist, who's party practice on nation equality and using some ideas from Yu Dafu, but also having mixed ideas from Lu Xun and some of his opponents in the League.\n\nFaction Influence:\n§VMayakovskyite Faction:  [?quibai_faction]§!\n§RCreation Society:  [?creation_faction]§!\n§tAgrarian Faction:  [?agrarian_faction]§!\n§MStudent Union Faction:  [?student_faction]§!\n"
