BRM_the_chettyar_crisis_decision_category:0 "The State Council"
BRM_the_chettyar_crisis_decision_category_desc:0 "The collapse of the British regime brought the battered royalists back into power under a fragile coalition, but it could not solve the economic inequities left behind by colonial rule. The Chettyars, Indian landholders who have only become more powerful with the absence of British restrictions, are driving rural inequity and rage to a breaking point. Failure to handle this will leave lasting consequences as factionalism grows within Burma.\nFactions:\n\nThe §XTraditionalists§! are seeking to consolidate and centralise power around the throne. Their political control bestows political power. However, their power only comes from balancing the power of all factions with their own undeniable superiority.\n\nThe §YInternational Traders§! seek to further the economy of Burma, and will gain more trade deal efficiency the more power they have. However, the more they gain, the more they will reduce public support and military factories.\n\nThe §BUCBA Nationalist Movement§! seeks to control the political  apparatus and guide it towards their aims of conservative, modernising nationalism. It will provide increasing production bonuses for civilian factories. They may ally with the Traditionalists but are likely to lean more towards educational reform and expanded rights and economic roles for native Burmans.\n\nThe §RThakin-Radical Movement§!  has built on its educational base to expand towards labour rights, education expansion and rural mobilisation. This movement will contribute recruitable population, and mild political power buffs.\n\nThe §FMilitary§! starts with Negligible power, but unlocking increasing power to the political army will grant it more influence in politics. They grant powerful bonuses to the military's offensive and defensive power.\nFactions\n\n§XTraditionalists: [?burma_trad|%0]§!\n§YInternational Traders: [?burma_int|%0]§!\n§BUCBA Nationalist Movement: [?burma_ubca|%0]§!\n§RThakin-Radical Movement: [?burma_thak|%0]§!\n§FMilitary: [?burma_army|%0]§!"

BRM_shan_resistance:0 "Shan State Resistance"
BRM_shan_resistance_desc:0 "Periodic flag marches are all that remains of the nominal authority of the Burmese state - repeated failures to pacify the Shan state could have severe consequences on the legitimacy of the country."
BRM_rangoon_export:0 "Rangoon Export Firms"
BRM_rangoon_export_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the British market and the Empire, Burma is forced to rely on credit lent from German banks. But these firms rely on often unstable international prices that have only become more so in the 1930s, and the failure of the Bullinger Pool's implicit support risks plunging Burma into total economic disarray."

### Events ###
burma.0.t:0 "A War-torn Nation"
burma.0.d:0 "The 1925 British Revolution unavoidably caused the downfall of its once mighty colonial empire. While India proper soon cemented into three separate nation states, the status of Burma was long unclear - with Bharatiya, Siamese, Chinese, Native Burmese and British loyalist forces all operating in the country, the region was a chaotic patchwork of territories resembling near-warlordism. Although the British loyalists (operating mainly from Mandalay and Rangoon) were soon crushed and the Chinese were soon distracted by their own civil war, the Bharatiyas and Siamese kept troops within the country until 1929 - when, fed up with the unstable situation, German mediation brought an end to the hostilities. The resulting treaty awarded parts of eastern and northern Burma to Siam, and left the rest of the country under a restored Konbaung dynasty. In the years since, Queen Myat Pya Lat has struggled to cement her rule against an increasingly radical and politically demanding populace. All the while, Bharatiya waits for an opportunity to spread the revolution east. When the day comes, will Burma be ready?"
