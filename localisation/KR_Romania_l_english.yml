By discreetly pulling a few strings and shifting high-society discourse ever more in our illustrious monarch's favour, we can undermine their support from above, ultimately leading to an erosion of their base below."

ROM_assess_the_military_desc:0 "Since the Iron Guard took power, we already violated the Treaty of Bucharest by introducing army conscription, where the treaty limited Romania to an army of 45,000 men. We need to further expand the army, to ensure a victory in future conflicts."

ROM_legacy_of_berhelot_desc:0 "Henri Berthelot headed the French military mission in Romania during the Weltkrieg. It was largely thanks to his efforts that we were able to rebuild our forces after the 1916 debacle and achieve several victories against a combined Central Powers offensive. As such, his legacy has been enduring among our officers, with many wanting to rebuild the Romanian Army as he had in 1917."

ROM_marasti_marasesti_oituz_desc:0 "The war against the Central Powers are riddled with Romanian tactical victories despite our enemies' strategic victory. The Battles of Marasti and Marasesti are the greatest example of Romanian skill and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds.

ROM_defense_focus_desc:0 "Let them come to us across the treacherous mountain passes. We will greet them with lead and steel from our guns.

ROM_spirit_of_aggression:0 "Spirit of Aggression"
ROM_spirit_of_aggression_desc:0 "We will never be able to liberate Romanians across the Carpathians by sitting behind them, hunkered down in bunkers. We must succeed where we failed in 1916 and take the fight to our enemies, or else we will be sitting ducks against our enemies' manoeuvres."

ROM_modern_calarasi_desc:0 "Calarasi are Romanian cavalrymen that have been around since the early days of the Romanian principalities.

ROM_offense_focus:0 "Strike Like Lightning"
ROM_offense_focus_desc:0 "Speed is everything. It means we can strike the enemy first, while maintaining initiative means our foes cannot respond properly, always on the back foot. This is the only way we can overwhelm and destroy the enemy before they can destroy us with numbers."

ROM_mountain_hunters:0 "Carpathian Hunters"
ROM_mountain_hunters_desc:0 "The \"Vanatori\", or Hunters, were formed in 1917, modelled after the French Chasseurs Alpin in response to Austria-Hungary's elite Kaiserschützen.

ROM_the_king_ferdinand_desc:0 "A proper flagship for the Romanian Navy has been envisioned for quite some time, but never made reality. This dream must be made a reality as we become a serious power in the Black Sea. Considering our capabilities and limitations, a cruiser will certainly do."
ROM_black_sea_dominance:0 "Royal Navy of the Black Sea"
ROM_black_sea_dominance_desc:0 "The Black Sea is one of the major economic artery for our nation; seeking to achieve supremacy over it is merely natural to protect our interests.

ROM_river_gunboats:0 "Expand the Danube Flotilla"

ROM_ground_support_operations:0 "Flying Artillery"
ROM_ground_support_operations_desc:0 "Light bomber aircraft rapidly gained the moniker \"flying artillery\" during the Weltkrieg, as their use on the field has been rapidly seen as a new form of artillery.

ROM_king_under_surveillance:0 "King Under Surveillance"
ROM_king_under_surveillance_desc:0 "While the institution of the monarchy is respectable, it is clear that it must be kept from intervening too much within our affairs. By making sure that vital court offices are always staffed by our men, we can reduce the king's manoeuvring room enough that he will have no choice but to cooperate.

ROM_tradition_eternal_desc:0 "It is not our way to recklessly send our men dashing into danger, as losing the cream of our crop would only weaken our strength just like what happened at Nicopole or at Crecy all those years ago.

ROM_expand_hierarchy:0 "Expand the Hierarchy of the Legion"
ROM_expand_hierarchy_desc:0 "As our movement grows, the Legion's hierarchic structure must grow as well, not only to accommodate the increased numbers but to maintain the Captain's firm grasp as well.

ROM_alliance_with_the_church_desc:0 "As much as some clerics would prefer to dissociate from us, we still have been very stalwart in the defence of the Holy Church and the Right Faith.

ROM_agrarian_price_controls:0 "Agrarian Price Controls"
ROM_agrarian_price_controls_desc:0 "The market, while an useful tool to attain great wealth for our nation, can also be an unyielding malefactor for our poor, who can end up having to resort to bartering or subsistence farming to get the foodstuff they need. No longer, for we will impose a set of relatively static prices for basic foodstuff, so that years from now the basic price for bread as imagined by everyone shall be the one dictated by us."
ROM_legionary_culture_centers:0 "Legionary Culture Centres"
ROM_legionary_culture_centers_desc:0 "Without proper awareness of our culture, we would lose ourselves in the fogs of history; to avoid this prospective shame, we will open up a series of cultural centres across the country, meant to educate the Romanian people to their heritage and help them see their great purpose, sponsored and aided along by our faithful cavaliers in green of course."

ROM_legionary_cooperatives_desc:0 "Through the years of combat and rulership, our system of cooperatives has proven itself an useful way to make money and increase Legionary ties, both between themselves and the average people.

ROM_court_the_king_desc:0 "His Majesty reportedly was aghast when he heard of our election victory, and considering the troubles that led to this peculiar situation, he cannot be blamed. However, to avoid the troubles we had with the last king, Carol II, we should at least try to play nice with His Majesty; if it seems like we try to uphold democracy in some way, the chances of being ousted early will decrease accordingly."
ROM_the_first_among_parties:0 "The First Among the Parties"
ROM_the_first_among_parties_desc:0 "Our status as the first among equals within the evolving Romanian political system is growing more and more uncontested by the day; a development appreciated by our great Captain, who ended up growing to be more of a politician than a combatant like back in the day.

ROM_legionary_revolution:0 "Legionary Revolution"
ROM_legionary_revolution_desc:0 "As venerable as our Captain was, his attempt to adherence to the old party system led to his murder by his opponents. It was by calling back to our past as a revolutionary cell that we have reasserted control, and now we are in a position to truly unleash our own revolution.

ROM_cult_of_the_warrior:0 "Cult of the Warrior"
ROM_cult_of_the_warrior_desc:0 "Intellectualism, although necessary in some regards, is not the most ideal way of life for us, for it begets cowardice and chokes out bravery.

ROM_carol_constitution_desc:0 "The last few years have only demonstrated that the current constitution is incredibly flawed.

ROM_nrf_desc:0 "National unity has been shattered by the last few years of incompetence, driven by the selfish interests of political parties and demagogues.

ROM_crown_patronage:0 "Crown Patronage"
ROM_crown_patronage_desc:0 "His Majesty is an unapologetic lover of the arts and large sums are spent subsidizing cultural projects- especially if they serve to improve the king's image.

ROM_corporatism:0 "Corporate Alliance"
ROM_corporatism_desc:0 "While corporatism is an important aspect of His Majesty's government, corporate interests are also undeniably crucial in developing the country.

#Intro
romania.0.t:0 "Kingdom of Romania, 1936"
romania.0.d:0 "The Kingdom of Romania was still a relatively young country when it joined the Weltkrieg in 1916 with grand ambitions of taking Transylvania from the Hungarians, a dream that remains unrealized to this day. Despite some initial successes in 1916, the small country was quickly overwhelmed by German, Austrian and Bulgarian troops. Against all odds, the Romanian Army did not break and instead established new positions around Iasi. With help of the Russians and the French they rebuilt their strength and repelled the Central Powers again and again. The end only came when the Russian Revolution and collapse of the Eastern Front made Romania's position untenable.\n\nMany young men had died for an ideal that ultimately proved just out of reach, and the situation in the country itself had improved for naught. The Treaty of Bucharest was bitter, even more so because the Romanian army had fought well. With this, the stab-in-the-back narrative emerged – Romania was betrayed by the Russians, they were left alone by the Western Entente, they were sabotaged from the inside by traitorous minorities such as Jews. Radical movements rose quickly, fueled by bitterness, revanchism and social issues such as unequal land use. By 1936 the strongest of those movements is the Legion of the Archangel Michael, popularly known as the Legionary Movement, led by young and charismatic Corneliu Codreanu, the Capitan of the Iron Guard.\n\nIn 1927, King Ferdinand passed away and was succeeded by his son, Carol II. Even though Carol had a reputation for being quite the womanizer the war had really left its mark on the king. His dream is clear: to succeed in where his father had failed.  In his quest the king found an ally equally driven and struck a deal with Codreanu. Two men united in their revanchist fervor tore apart the democratic system in the 1933 elections. After the assassination of Prime Minister I. G. Duca by the Iron Guard, Codreanu formed the first Legionary government: the first step towards Greater Romania.\n\nWhile the king and the Captain might be allies in their revanchist project, it is clear they ultimately do not wish to share power. The so-called ‘Great Game’ between these two men began quickly after the elections after Codreanu started his ambitious land reform, an issue very popular among his base. Influential landowners appealed to the king, who in turn forced Codreanu to halt his reforms. With the growing enmity between two men the power struggle can only get more fierce, with neither one ready to give up power. As long as they share the common goal of Greater Romania they will work together, but after that...only God knows."
romania.0.a:0 "A new future for Romania!"
#Great Game Mechanics
romania.1.t:0 "Mechanics of the Great Game"
romania.1.d:0 "There is an additional resource used by both Codreanu and the king, Influence. New laws and policies require approval of both the Legionary-controlled Assembly and the king. This forces both parties to make concessions to drive their own agenda.\n\nAfter completing either focus Entrench Party Control or Lay the Seeds for the Camarilla you will unlock a set of decisions to interact with the system from either Codreanu’s or from Carol’s point of view. The decision of the political path is a decision to pick a side, and if you manage to keep that side in power after the Unification your nation will be stronger than if it changes control.\n\nIn addition to the decisions, §bInfluence§! is gained from the political branch of the focus tree and it is primarily spent on the land reform branch, which requires influence to advance. But beware, your opponent also has their own Influence which gives them more power, enabling many events not necessarily in your advantage."
romania.1.a:0 "To the victor goes the spoils!"
#Union Day
romania.7.t:0 "Union Day"
romania.7.d:0 "Union Day represents the Union of the Principalities of Moldova and Wallachia on the 24th of January, 1859, when Alexandru Ioan Cuza was elected as 'Domnitor' in both principalities as a way to bypass the ruling that the two cannot unite in a single state. It is regarded as a National Holiday in Romania."
romania.7.a:0 "Everything for the Fatherland!"
##Greater Union Day WIP

##Black Monday
romania.2.t:0 "Berlin Crash Hits Bucharest"
romania.2.d:0 "Today was a dreadful day for the stock market of Bucharest as many important banks and corporations went into a nosedive after the chain reaction that began with the crash of the Berlin stock market. Many businesses in Romania have been owned by large German and Austrian corporations, which are now in ruins. The unemployment rate has climbed sky-high and the exports sector has been hit bad after the demand for oil and agricultural products in Central Europe has plummeted."
romania.2.a:0 "Even now they find ways to torment us."
##Nationalization of the Foreign Assets
romania.3.t:0 "Nationalization of German Corporations"
romania.3.d:0 "As German banks collapsed, so did the German corporations owning large parts of Romanian oil industry. The exports-based economy of Romania crashed hard after the demand for oil and agricultural products hit the rock bottom in Reichspakt, which has been Romania's main trading partner. Unemployment soared sky-high in a fortnight, and our largest bank is on the precipice of collapse.\n While most non-syndicalist countries simply have to endure the collapse, our government holds a significant control over the economical system. Should we desire so, we could obtain the assets of crashed German corporations quite cheaply and nationalize the refinery industry, saving thousands of Romanian jobs in the process. This might not be a popular move in Berlin, however, but it would send a strong message about Codreanu's government and its dedication to the well-being of all Romanians."
romania.3.a:0 "Enough of Berlin. Nationalize German-owned industries."
romania.3.b:0 "Continue with nationalization, but pay the corporations modest price."
##Germans hear about the nationalization
romania.69.t:0 "Romania Nationalizes the Oil Fields"
romania.69.d1:0 "After the complete crash of Oil-Lands Leasehold Company managing the Ploiesti oil fields Codreanu's government proceeded to nationalize the assets of the bankrupt corporation. It is yet another case of Romanian breaking the Bucharest Treaty, but there is little we can do to stop them - neither does the public care much about the issue."
romania.69.d2:0 "After the complete crash of Oil-Lands Leasehold Company managing the Ploiesti oil fields Codreanu's government proceeded to nationalize the assets of the bankrupt corporation. They did offer a 'fair price' of the company, though - which is practically meaningless gesture, but it is a gesture of good will nonetheless. There is little we can do to stop them - neither does the public care much about the issue."
romania.69.a:0 "If they think they can survive without Mitteleuropa, so be it!"
romania.69.b:0 "We're too busy to worry about petty things."
##Organize Relief Work
romania.4.t:0 "Relief Work for the Unemployed"
romania.4.d:0 "Even though we have alleviated the effects of the economic recession quite effectively, there's still huge number of unemployed in Romania. The government proposes state-funding of relief work in Iron Guard-administrated labour corps, while the king wishes to support private industrialists to provide relief jobs. While the first option would be assured cure to the unemployment, the proponents of King's policy argue it would be only temporary measure which does not benefit the economy as whole."
romania.4.a:0 "The Conducator will find work for his people."
romania.4.b:0 "Economic recovery needs private sector!"
##Safeguard Banking Sector
romania.5.t:0 "Banca de Credit Roman Saved!"
romania.5.d:0 "After the bankruptcy of the large bank Marmorosch-Blank in 1931 the government created safeguards to prevent such economical catastrophes in the future. The Superior Banking Council was created to regulate and investigate the banking sector in 1934, and the institution has never been more necessary. While banks in many countries crashed hard and fast, a total collapse of Banca de Credit Roman was prevented through the SBC safeguards. The catastrophe that broke the backs of great, international German banks left the Romanian ones surprisingly unharmed."
romania.5.a:0 "Great!"
##Entente Trade Deals
romania.6.t:0 "The Future of Romania"
romania.6.d:0 "As the year 1936 begins, the struggle between the nation's two competing leaders, King Carol II and Prime Minister Codreanu, is entering a new phase. Deadlocked for some time, the two are running out of space to manoeuvre around each other. With growing frequency, they are starting to collide head-on and it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the facade of cooperation. As it stands, the king and the Captain are both realizing that the time to take the other out for good is approaching. As the two personalities stand to clash, people will be increasingly forced to pick a side or face the consequences of neutrality alone."
romania.6.a:0 "I will stand by Codreanu and his Legionaries"
romania.6.b:0 "Carol II is the rightful ruler of all Romania"


#Continue the land reform flavor
romania.68.t:0 "Long-Awaited Land Reform"
romania.68.d1:0 "There has been multiple attempts to conduct a comprehensive reform of land ownership in Romania after the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the most ambitious attempt to solve the unequal land ownership was the Legionary land reform of 1934, which came to a halt after the wealthy aristocrats asked the king to intervene on their behalf. This time Prime Minister Codreanu is defiant to go through with the large-scale plans of breaking up the large estates and give the farmholds to the peasants who actually farm them. These large estates form easily over half of all arable land in Romania.\n\nThe aristocracy seems quite worried about Codreanu's plans, and there have already been multiple appeals to the king to stop or by the very least milden the planned reform program. As the king does wield power to ultimately block any laws the parliament passes, his opinions and influence cannot be ignored. It is hard to imagine that he would actually block the reform, but he will surely aim to get his own ideas incorporated to the greatest restructuring of Romanian economy in the twentieth century."
romania.68.d2:0 "There has been multiple attempts to conduct a comprehensive reform of land ownership in Romania after the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the most ambitious attempt to solve the unequal land ownership was the Legionary land reform of 1934, which came to a halt after the wealthy aristocrats asked the king to intervene on their behalf. King Carol II protected the rights of the aristocrats, but he did also show Codreanu his true colors.\n\nLand reform is still a necessary one, though. Land use in Romanian countryside is both unequal and ineffective. Unlike the Legionary vision of breaking up the large estates, the king cannot rely on such brutish methods. Instead the government should aim to work with the landholders, not against them. Actual legislative power is in the hands of the Legionaries, though - which will require giving them some influence over the reform process."
romania.68.a:0 "It is our duty to the peasants of this land."

##Great Game events
#IG infiltrates court
romania.10.t:0 "Double Agent in the Camarilla!"
romania.10.d:0 "The Camarilla is the unofficial privy council of His Majesty and is filled with his supporters and advisors. On the other hand, the social circle around the king is quite wide and it was only a matter of time before the Iron Guard would successfully infiltrate it. The information they managed to acquire could cause a scandal involving a member of the Camarilla if the double agent isn't taken care of in time."
romania.10.a:0 "The royal scandal is unveiled!"
romania.10.b:0 "Silence him."
#Street violence
romania.11.t:0 "Violence in the Streets!"
romania.11.d:0 "While the Legion holds parliamentary activities on a tight leash, opposition to Codreanu across the political spectrum was never fully silenced. Earlier today, activists had taken to the streets in protest, only to be met by violence as Codreanu's Greenshirts descended on them. While it is uncertain whether their leader ordered their actions, we are in a position to turn a blind eye on the fighting and let the Iron Guard silence the dissidents, or have security forces intervene to fight the Greenshirts."
romania.11.a:0 "Let the degenerates shout."
romania.11.b:0 "They're not the only ones who can fight!"
#IG passes populist policies
romania.12.t:0 "Codreanu's Populist Policies"
romania.12.d:0 "With the Legion largely in control of parliament, Codreanu, as Prime Minister, submitted a piece of legislation to the Chamber of Deputies. It is an open secret among parliamentarians that the legislation has little substance and is meant to woo the people and garner support for the Captain's land reform program. Carol II's Camarilla is uneasy about letting Codreanu get away with such blatant demagoguery and suggest that the king veto the legislation, but doing so would hurt his popularity among a large segment of the population. Alternatively, it was also suggested that the king could use his influence or threaten the Prime Minister into giving credit to His Majesty instead, boosting the image of the royalists instead."
romania.12.a:0 "Accept the legislation."
romania.12.b:0 "Veto their sad attempt to bribe the people."
romania.12.c:0 "Pass their policies as your own."
#IG tightens censorship
romania.13.t:0 "Codreanu Tightens Censorship."
romania.13.d:0 "In another move to silence opposition, a newspaper belonging to the opposition was forcefully shut down by the Iron Guard before they could start today's print. Claiming that the paper had a history of publishing libelous publications, the Captain loudly proclaimed that until the media could \"mature\", censorship laws are to be tightened in order to protect Romanians from their lies."
romania.13.a:0 "At least it silences the dissenters."
romania.13.b:0 "Focus on internal party media instead."
#Legionary rally
romania.14.t:0 "Large Legionary Rally Gathering!"
romania.14.d:0 "The Legion of Archangel Michael prides itself in their mass rallies gathering thousands of supporters. These rallies, however, feature firey speeches containing blatant anti-Semitic rhetoric and increasing calls for violence against perceived enemies of the nation. Beside, the king see these as displays of power from his rival as a blatant threat to his rule. Of course, King Carol could bestow Codreanu with his royal generosity and allow him and his thugs to parade all they want in exchange for favours, such as letting His Majesty take centre stage, or forbid it altogether. However, this would likely result in a livid response from the Legion and their notorious Greenshirts."
romania.14.a:0 "Forbid their little meeting."
romania.14.a:0 "Allow it... with a price."
#King's public appearance
romania.15.t:0 "King Appears in Public"
romania.15.d:0 "Until recently, King Carol has often appeared alongside Prime Minister Codreanu in public in a show of unity between the nation's two leaders. However, the king has begun appearing in public on his own, often impromptu without notifying the Captain. It is no secret that Carol is hoping to build up a personal base of support independent from the Legion and it is clearly a threat to Codreanu's own position. Either we let the king parade and avoid a controversy as the nation needs to appear united, or protest these displays as Carol selfishly threatens to sabotage their cooperation."
romania.15.a:0 "Let him entertain the masses if he so wishes."
romania.15.b:0 "Protest his decision."
#Carol's conspirators revealed
romania.16.t:0 "Royalist Conspirators in the Officer Corps"
romania.16.d:0 "The Royal Romanian Army has always remained independent of the struggle between Carol II and Codreanu even if the two leaders have supporters within it. It has become clear, however, that a number of officers are showing increasingly blatant loyalty to the king, potentially trying to gain the Army's support against Codreanu. Before this royal conspiracy can grow out of hand, we may want to convince the General Staff to punish these loud-mouthed royalists. However, Codreanu is wary of meddling in military affairs, for he knows how much they despise meddling and how dependent he is on their aloof attitude towards politics."
romania.16.a:0 "Punish them harshly."
romania.16.b:0 "We must stay on the good side of the military."
#King's high society contacts
romania.17.t:0 "King's High Society Contacts"
romania.17.d:0 "King Carol II is an active member of Romania's high society. From wealthy industrialists to artists and socialites, he tends to support them both personally and financially, and they appreciate His Majesty's support. Many of them are eager to meet the king in person and enjoy His ear for whatever trouble or project of theirs needs it. On the other hand, Prime Minister Codreanu has been wary of these contacts as they threaten his own standing in the complex circle the Romanian government has become. He may use his influence to limit these contacts and ensure that Romanian high socity doesn't move against him."
romania.17.a:0 "Let them meet the king."
romania.17.b:0 "Perhaps the king is busy at the moment."
#King sows discontent among legion
romania.18.t:0 "Dissent in the Iron Guard"
romania.18.d:0 "The Legion of Archangel Michael, or Iron Guard, has become a powerful mass movement with a huge following. Despite strict ideological discipline, however, the Guard is not monolithic and it increasingly faces non-conformism within its wide membership. These non-conformist tendencies, be they towards radicalism or moderatism, have allowed the king to exploit divisions within the movement leading some young, outspoken Legionnaires to criticize the Legion's leadership. That these dissidents will be punished is a certainty, but degree of said punishment is not - Cordeanu may not wish to advertise this dissidence in the Legion or alienate younger members whose support remains tentative."
romania.18.a:0 "Punish the non-conformists."
romania.18.b:0 "They are young, they will learn."
#Anti-IG newspaper propaganda
romania.19.t:0 "Anti-Legionary Propaganda"
romania.19.d:0 "Newspapers throughout the nation have sprouted out recently, all churning propaganda against Codreanu and the Legion. When the Greenshirts tried to shut them down, however, they either found the paper trail leading to people under the king's protection or were ambushed by the king's own paramilitary if they pushed on. For the time being, propaganda against the government has been successfully spread all over Romania."
romania.19.a:0 "Damn that King!"
#Legionary Workers Corps
romania.20.t:0 "Corpul Muncitoresc Legionar"
romania.20.d:0 "The Legionary Workers' Corps is Codreanu's attempt to co-opt syndicalist methods and supporters into his ultranationalist movement. In essence, the Corps is a corporatist association of Romanian workers in a strict hierarchy similar to the Iron Guard intending to replace trade unions. While it claims to aim for equality of workers and factory owners, it is by-and-large an attempt to attract more urban workers into the Legion and mobilize it as another paramilitary wing to support the movement."
romania.20.a:0 "Better green than red unions!"
romania.20.b:0 "We should restrain their influence."
#Legion Expands
romania.21.t:0 "Iron Guard Expands"
romania.21.d:0 "Membership into the Legion of Archangel Michael has soared recently thanks to Codreanu's recent successes and populist rhetoric. It is clear that his movement is more attractive to common Romanians regardless of the Captain's Demagoguery, hurting the king's reputation and popularity in the process."
romania.21.a:0 "Damn them!"
#Revanchist Rally
romania.22.t:0 "Revanchist Rally"
romania.22.d:0 "Revanchism has become a permanent fixture in Romanian politics. No political movement, moderate or radical, can avoid it and opposing it has led to horrible consequences for politicians perceived as \"traitors\". In recent years, the Iron Guard has embodied Romania's revanchist spirit and has been shamelessly fueling it in their rhetoric. Because of it, revanchist rallies have become intimately tied with the Legion where they have been able to thrive. Restraining these rallies would prove costly, unpopular affairs even if it would limit the Guard's influence and pervasion."
romania.22.a:0 "Everything For the Country!"
romania.22.b:0 "The agitators should be restrained."
#Cross Brotherhoods
romania.23.t:0 "Cross Brotherhoods Surge"
romania.23.d:0 "The Brotherhood of the Cross is the youth wing of the Legion of Archangel Michael and has become an increasingly prominent institution among Romanian children. Recently, their membership has surged, likely due to how pervasive it has become after numerous recruitment drives and state support. Brotherhoods across the country are helping the Legion grow and will prove to be essential in the long-term as it secures future membership into the Guard and organizes the future core of the movement."
romania.23.a:0 "Everything For the Country!"
#King Strengthens the Camarilla
romania.24.t:0 "King Expands the Camarilla"
romania.24.d:0 "While the Camarilla remains an unofficial organization, Carol II has steadily been strengthening it, clearly intending for it to become an official government institution. For now, the little privy council's actual influence remains limited, and Codreanu can tolerate its existence, but it would be wise to keep an eye on them should we decide to let it exist for a while longer."
romania.24.a:0 "Let him play a feudal lord."
romania.24.b:0 "This man is a threat to Codreanu."
#King's Philantrophy
romania.25.t:0 "Carol II's Philanthropy"
romania.25.d:0 "In a clear attempt at improving his poor image, King Carol donated large sums of money to numerous charities across the country. Hoping the create an image as a generous philanthropist, the king made sure that news of these donations were made very public and spread through Royalist papers. While we could simply ignore the king's blatant challenge, we could also try to outshine him by publicly increasing state expenditures towards charities and services."
romania.25.a:0 "Let him spend his unjust wealth."
romania.25.b:0 "Show them that the state cares too!"
#Royal Rural Outreach
romania.26.t:0 "King Tours the Countryside"
romania.26.d:0 "As the king continues to improve his abysmal public image, his recent tours have led him to the Romanian countryside where he has made many public gatherings and speeches exalting Romanian farmers and inspecting results from the land reform program. We could simply ignore the king's pathetic attempt at wooing our support base and not allow it to gain even more attention, but it may be wise to counter it and make sure Romanians are reminded of who truly cares about their well-being."
romania.26.a:0 "He should stay there!"
romania.26.b:0 "Show the farmers who truly cares about them."
romania.26.c:0 "The Legion must not forget its roots!"
#Sentinels of the Fatherland
romania.27.t:0 "Straja Tarii Founded"
romania.27.d:0 "The Sentinel of the Motherland is the youth wing of the Royalist movement meant to counter the growing strength of the Legion's own Cross Brotherhoods. Sentinels are bound by a creed: Faith and Labour for Country and King. Like the Cross Brotherhoods, the Sentinel offers military training for Romania's youth, forming them as loyal patriots of the nation and its King, the \"Great Sentinel\". While we will be unable to discern its success for some time, what is clear is that the two youth movements are bound to clash should the king and Codreanu split."
romania.27.a:0 "What misguided young patriots."
#Political assassination
romania.28.t:0 "Opposition Politician Assassinated!"
romania.28.d:0 "A politician of the opposition was found dead this morning after assassins broke into his home and shot him. While it is an open secret that neither Legionaries or Royalists are upset about the death of a dissident, both movements are eager to take advantage of this opportunity for their own gains. As such, the Royalists are eager to properly punish the assassins and show respect for due process, the Legion is gearing for mass arrests in order to weaken their political rivals further."
romania.28.a:0 "Too bad."

romania.29.d:0 "Paramilitary violence has become increasingly common as the Iron Guard grew in prominence and numbers. While political opposition hasn't been going down quietly since the Codreanu became Prime Minister, no other political group has been able to organize as ruthless a paramilitary as the Legion's Iron Guard and their attacks on dissidents have largely been one-sided unless security forces intervened (and they largely didn't). Stopping their violence and dispersing the armed men will be a costly affair, even if it helps being peace in the streets. Besides, their thuggery has been handy to keep opposition to both the king and government weak."
romania.29.a:0 "They were enemies of the nation."
romania.29.b:0 "The law must be obeyed."
romania.29.c:0 "The war for the nation's souls is won in the streets!"
#Legionaries target synagogue
romania.30.t:0 "Legionaries Attack Synagogues"
romania.30.d:0 "Anti-Semitism is definitely not new in Romania and has been widespread for some time, but the Legion has brought it to previously-unimaginable levels. A common scapegoat in the past, Jewish Romanians have increasingly become targets as revanchist sentiments radicalized large segments of the Romanian population. With alarming regularity, Greenshirts attack synagogues throughout the country with security forces often turning a blind eye. As yet another anti-Semitic incident as occurred, it remains to be seen how the divided authorities will respond."
romania.30.a:0 "There are always radicals."
romania.30.b:0 "Punish those responsible."
#Strikes
romania.31.t:0 "Factory Workers Strike"
romania.31.d:0 "While the Red Scare caused by the fall of France to syndicalism has largely blown over, succeeding Romanian governments have been quick to stamp out labour agitation wherever it sprouted. With the country gradually industrializing, labour disputes increased. The Legion has been harsh on any kind of apparent \"syndicalization\" as Greenshirts are regularly employed or volunteered as strikebreakers. With factory workers threatening to go on strike in Bucharest, authorities merely have to say the word and the Iron Guard will make short work of it. Of course, negotiations are not out of the question in order to avoid a crisis, or even simply wait it out until the workers give up."
romania.31.a:0 "Let them strike."
romania.31.b:0 "Negotiate a compromise."
romania.31.c:0 "Punish them harshly!"
#Democratic opposition
romania.32.t:0 "Opposition Speaks against Codreanu"
romania.32.d:0 "While Codreanu is prime minister with a comfortable majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it is by no means a monopoly of parliamentary activities. With Codreanu tightening censorship, unleashing his Greenshirts at any threat to his rule, and the king seemingly turning a blind eye to His Prime Minister's abuses, a gathering of opposition politicians have publicly criticized the Codreanu government's disregard for the Constitution. The demonstration remains relatively small as the Iron Guard keeps an eye on it, waiting for orders to disperse them."
romania.32.a:0 "They do have a point."
romania.32.b:0 "Silence them!"

#Carol and Lupescu
romania.61.t:0 "King's Mistress"
romania.61.d:0 "The Romanian royal family, like every other, has a long history with extramarital affairs and marital infidelity. There is, however, an expectation of discretion: scandals are to be avoided and liaisons terminated should such a scandal occur. The king, however, not only appears to have no discretion whatsoever; indeed, he seems to take great pleasure in publicly flaunting his womanizing lifestyle.\n\nThe origins of Elena \"Magda\" Lupescu are a source of confusion and debate. It is known that she inherited her Catholicism through her mother, who is a Jewish-born convert; her father, also Jewish-born, is an apothecary who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. She was briefly married to a certain Lieutenant Ion Tampeanu, but divorced some time after the war. It is not known when she met the king, but she only started appearing alongside him after he was crowned and she quickly became one of his closest advisors.\n\nThe king has long been known as a playboy, but he has been acting differently with this recent mistress. Unlike his previous affairs, the relationship appears very strong, giving Magda significant, and apparently lasting, influence within Carol's inner circle. On the other hand, she has increasingly been targeted by opponents of King Carol as they try to weaken his position."
romania.61.a:0 "It's not like the king can deny her anything."
romania.61.b:0 "This is exactly the kind of degeneracy that will bring our nation into ruin!"
#Carol and Lupescu 2
romania.62.t:0 "Smear Campaign against Lupescu"
romania.62.d:0 "The king's mistress, Magda Lupescu, has recently been targeted by Legion-aligned papers across Romania in a rather obvious attempt to smear her name. The exposé describes the \"Jewish whore\" as the power behind the throne, accusing her of manipulating Carol and subverting Codreanu's government, especially regarding his land reform program. The Jewish origins of her parents are emphasized to further demonize her in the eyes of an increasingly anti-Semitic public and place her as a centrepiece of an anti-Romanian conspiracy. The king is absolutely livid to say the least and the campaign could very well cause a public split between him and his Prime Minister."
romania.62.a:0 "How dare they? They must issue public apologies instantly!"
romania.62.b:0 "Perhaps she should keep low profile for some time."
romania.62.c:0 "What a mess they have caused."
#King demands an apology
romania.63.t:0 "King Demands an Apology"
romania.63.d:0 "As expected, King Carol II publicly admonished the Legion for their recent smear campaign against his mistress, Madame Lupescu. In retaliation, the king has demanded that Prime Minister Codreanu publicly apologize for the incident and properly punish the Legionaries responsible. While Codreanu has made little effort to hide his disgust of the mistress, he and the king depend on an image of cooperation in their common goal to forge Greater Romania and the incident threatens to expose how bitterly opposed they truly are. On the other hand, it would be a public humiliation for the Legion to bow down to Carol and could hurt the unity of the movement as the Captain depends on a strong cult of personality."
romania.63.a:0 "Even if they are right, it is not their place to judge the king... yet."
romania.63.b:0 "The Captain will always stand by his men!"
#Codreanu compromises
romania.64.t:0 "Codreanu Sides with the King"
romania.64.d:0 "In order to avoid a public dispute with the king, Codreanu agreed to his demands and publicly apologized for the Legion's attack on the king's mistress. This is a clear victory for Carol, but the Captain insists that relations with His Majesty need to remain smooth for the time being. He has promised to make sure the offenders will be tried and punished accordingly."
romania.64.a:0 "Legionary tribunal will be enough!"
romania.64.b:0 "This is beyond your little cult."
romania.64.c:0 "It's not like there are any impartial courts in Romania anyway."
#Codreanu doesn't give in
romania.65.t:0 "Codreanu Stands by his Men"
romania.65.d:0 "Unwilling to be humiliated by the king, the Captain refused to apologize, standing by his men's actions against Madame Lupescu. For now, the crisis continues, threatening stability and the fragile alliance between Legionaries and Royalists."
romania.65.a:0 "It is our duty to tell the truth, even if the king does not like it."
romania.65.b:0 "Suppress their publications."
#Codreanu criticized
romania.66.t:0 "Codreanu Faces Criticism from his Own"
romania.66.d:0 "While the Captain appears to be the all-powerful leader of the Iron Guard, there have been whispers among Legionaries about his submissive response to the Lupescu affair. While the Legion is highly-disciplined and the cult of personality centred around Codreanu is strong, the Captain's recent actions have shaken this once-absolute confidence. Regardless, Codreanu is adamant that this was the right course of action and that the alliance of convenience with the king is still necessary."
romania.66.a:0 "We can never achieve Greater Romania if we keep bickering about some Jewish whore."
romania.66.b:0 "Is it traitors I hear?"
#Battle of the wills
romania.67.t:0 "Battle of the Wills"
romania.67.d:0 "The crisis between King Carol II and Captain Codreanu has reached breaking point as it has spilled over into parliament. In the struggle between the two leaders over the Lupescu smear campaign, Carol finally threatened to sack Codreanu and replace him, prompting the Captain to finally give in to the king's demands. However, the damage has already been done, and both men claim victory over the other, for Codreanu was forced to stand down, but not without a fight for his men."
romania.67.a:0 "Codreanu has to give in, for the sake of the nation."
romania.67.b:0 "Pushing it further would just make the king look foolish."

romania.33.d:0 "The Bulgarians are defeated!

#Plebiscite in Dobrogea
romania.36.t:0 "Plebiscite in Dobrudzha?"
romania.36.d:0 "Dobrudzha has reconquered during the Weltkrieg, but the defeated Romanians have never accepted the new situation. As such, especially in the last year or so, they have been trying to incite locals hostile to our government with separatist propaganda. In their latest attempt to destabilize our state, the radical nationalist Romanian government has been agitating for a plebiscite in the region, where the people would vote whether they would prefer to separate and join Romania, or remain within Bulgaria.\n\nThe unprecedented calls for a referendum have done much to destabilize the region as ethnic Romanians in Dobrudzha, likely funded by Bucharest, have embraced the idea and their protests have grown louder, fairly confident that the region's population is largely pro-Romanian and would thus easily lead to a reunification with Romania.\n\nWe are certainly not obligated to entertain their demands, for our claims to the region are just and recognized by international treaties, while plebiscites have no precedence in international law, making the Romanian demand nothing short of a naked act of aggression. On the other hand, allowing the referendum would calm tensions in the region, and there is a good chance that the people will vote in our favour, thus cementing our claims further. We could also tamper with the results if we so wish."
romania.36.a:0 "No way."

romania.37.d:0 "The Bulgarian government refused to allow a plebiscite in Dobrogea. Clearly, they are too scared of the inevitable result in our favour. However, now that the peaceful solution has been refused, we have just cause to liberate the Romanians of Bulgaria from their tyrants in Sofia. Bulgarian hegemony will have to be taken down by force of arms, as backing down now will only make us the laughing stock of Europe."

#Bulgaria cheats
romania.38.t:0 "Bulgaria Rigs the Plebiscite!"
romania.38.d:0 "The government of Bulgaria bowed to pressure and agreed to allow a plebiscite on the future of Dobrogea. However, it appears that the Bulgarians are afraid of the results, for there is already evidence that they are trying to rig it in their favour. Seeing that Sofia has no intention of keeping their end of the bargain, there is only one way to voice our protest: Send in the troops and ensure a free referendum!"

#Refusal
romania.40.t:0 "Dobrogea Refuses Unification"
romania.40.d:0 "Shocking news: The people of Dobrogea have voted in favour of Bulgaria. Our plan to have our claims on the region recognized by popular vote has completely backfired; we will have to press our claim another way as we suffer yet another humiliation on the international stage."
romania.40.a:0 "Awful."
#Transfer
romania.41.t:0 "Transfer of Territory"
romania.41.d:0 "The results of the plebiscite in Dobrudzha are in and the people have voted in favour of union with Romania. Not only are the claims of our enemies justified by popular vote, but it is clear in the eyes of the international community that our claims to the region lack legitimacy. Now, we must pay the price and cede the region or let the army reverse this humiliation by force."

romania.70.d:0 "Despite the Treaty of Bucharest supposedly ensuring free access to the Black Sea, much of our economy has been strangled by Bulgarian control of the Danubian Delta, as the river is perhaps our most important trade route. Now that the southern enemy has been vanquished once more we can finally use the river to its full capability for moving goods and supplies without any Bulgarian involvement. We shall no longer be bound by the tyrannical Treaty in this matter. The Delta is rightful part of Romania, now and forever!"

Our scouts have been able to create accurate and up-to-date maps of the area, including the enemy's presence, which will help commanders on the field navigate the treacherous terrain. Collaborators have already been contacted and allies within Transylvania are already monitoring enemy troop movements.

Delegates of the Romanian National Party, despite having previously claimed to only wish for autonomy, have finally revealed their treachery in a call to arms against the Monarchy. They formed the National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary in Gyulafehérvár and unanimously declared \"the unification of those Romanians and of all the territories inhabited by them with Romania.\"\n\nAs their treachery was plainly expected, the Armed Forces have launched their contingency plan for a Romanian invasion including a popular uprising in Transylvania.

romania.56.d:0 "For several decades, the Romanian population of eastern Hungary has been unhappy with our rule. As the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia united and secured their place as an independent state in the Balkans, many Transylvanians believe that their region is destined to be united with their brethren across the Carpathians regardless of our just, ancient historical claims over the region. During the Weltkrieg, Romania even attempted to take Transylvania by force, taking advantage of our weakness as we fought off the endless Russian hordes. Their defeat in the war has done little to weaken Romanian nationalism in the region.\n\nDespite the restrictions of the Treaty of Bucharest, the hostile regime in Bucharest has recently resumed propaganda efforts against us. Decrying our rule as tyrannical and oppressive, recent unrest in the cities of Arad, Kolozsvár and Nagyszeben have led to increased passive resistance against authorities. So far, the investigation has only found only ties with activists of the Romanian National Party (PNR), a legal party representing Romanian interests in Hungary, and not the hostile government in Bucharest. PNR leaders maintain that they wish to secure the autonomy of Transylvania and other Romanian-majority areas rather than separatism, claiming that they have no ties with the undemocratic regime in Bucharest."

This, of course, already put a strain on our relations with Romania, but it has come to the Gendarmerie's attention that a sister movement of the Iron Guard in Transylvania has been rapidly growing since the start of recent unrest in the region.

However, he had gathered his share of enemies during his fast promotion through the ranks of the Guard into becoming one of Codreanu's lieutenants. As such many within the Legion are at least suspicious of the young leader, and some even doubt his loyalty to the Captain.

romania.75.d:0 "Mihai Stelescu had only risen to prominence some years ago, but the young, shining star of the Legion had quickly gathered his own cult following among the movement. It is not clear whether it is from envy, ambition or idealism, but the young man and his followers have broken off from the main Legionary Movement in a very high-profile event. Stelescu has announced his plans of founding a movement of his own he calls Vulturii Albi, the White Eagles.\nStelescu's splinter movement, while still very nationalist and radical, calls for social reforms such as 8-hour work day and decent minimum wages. These ideas have brought many to question the group's true colors, and many prominent Legionnaires are openly accusing Stelescu for being a lapdog for international Jewish-Socialist conspiracy. The White Eagles in turn have criticized the main movement harshly of betraying the working class Romanians.\nStelescu's splinter movement is already being branded apostates by many prominent Legionnaires, and the Captain needs to decide soon how to deal with the crisis within the movement."

It is now time to decide the king's fate.\n\nOn one hand, the king's weakened position could be advantageous. Keeping him under house arrest after transferring his powers to Codreanu would ensure that he would only have to deal with a feeble, familiar threat that he can easily be rid of should the need arise. Otherwise, Carol should be forced to abdicate, leaving his place to the young Crown Prince Michael. Queen Helen, the mother of Michael snubbed by Carol, is particularly supportive of the second option, which could help us form a better relationship with the royal family."

While Dinu is largely remaining quiet over the issue, Gheorghe has become increasingly agitated over it and has been rallying other dissidents within the party behind him. The party leadership has been pressured into making a formal decision on the matter: Either give the Bratianu scions a position worthy of their contributions to the party, or continue to keep them in lower positions."

Despite the flagrant undemocratic programs of the government, the Romanian Parliament has remained open, if only as a tool to maintain legitimacy and rubber-stamp policies.\n\nAs such, in this era of political violence and intimidation, general elections are coming up and the major paramilitaries are already planning to intimidate the opposition into submission or silence.

His military career has been illustrious: From a cavalry officer in the War of Independence, he was a Major General during the Second Balkan War and Divisional General when Romania declared war on the Central Powers. During the Weltkrieg, he proved highly competent, securing several victories during the defence of Romania from the invading Central Powers. Ambitious and bitter at the Treaty of Bucharest, he was one of the principal voices lionizing the Romanian Army's conduct during the war and eagerly claiming that the country's politicians had stabbed them in the back by signing the treaty. While the main signatory of the treaty, Alexandru Marghiloman, would become quickly ostracized by the Nation, Averescu would be showered with praise, becoming Marshal of Romania in 1927. Regardless, Averescu was never able to capitalize on the unstable political situation in the country and would largely remain in the sidelines while Codreanu's Legion would rise to power, which he quietly supported during his own feud with the king.\n\nA state funeral with full military honours will be organized for him as the Romanian nation mourns one of its heroes that brightly shone during its darkest times."

He is considered one of Romania's greatest military heroes in recent history, being one of the two non-royals to attain the rank of Marshal. A career officer, his outstanding service life began as a cadet in 1868, rising through the ranks as a skilled staff officer (something extremely valuable at the time) before further studying at the prestigious military academy at Saint-Cyr. He would become highly-distinguished during the Second Balkan War as a Brigadier General and he would be quickly promoted afterwards. By the time Romania declared war on the Central Powers, Prezan commanded the First Army, securing Romania's few offensive victories of the war. This success saw him further promoted to Chief of Staff after the fall of Bucharest, where he would organize Romania's successful defense of Moldavia from General Mackensen's combined Central Powers force. With the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest, Prezan opted to retire, remaining aloof from the unstable post-war situation. Nevertheless, his superb abilities were recognized despite the defeat and he would be honoured with a marshal's baton in 1930 while his advice was highly-sought, remaining a quiet privy councillor to the king.\n\nThe venerable marshal will receive a proper state funeral with full military honours expected of Romania's heroes. Marshal Prezan's protégé and chief of staff in the Weltkrieg, Ion Antonescu, eulogized him as a \"symbol of hard work, patriotism, unwavering faith, and sacrifice\"."

Another candidate is Nicodim Munteanu, Metropolitan of Moldova, whose firm stance on syndicalism has earned him many sympathies in the country. Finally, as a show of unity, we could elect the incumbent Metropolitan of Transylvania, Nicolae Balan, who has shown himself to be a very careful teacher to his flock and grew very respected, in addition to being very interested in the education of Transylvanian Romanians and national unity. Whom shall guide the Church in these next years?"

romania.158.d:0 "This year marks a momentuous occasion, as the native recording company Electrecord has finally acquired enough means to produce records through its own means, heralding a new age in the Romanian recording industry.\n\nFounded in 1932 by the Jewish entrepreneur Nathan Mischonzniki, the young company initially focused itself on importing and multiplying foreign records, as well as distributing native recordings made overseas. Protected by King Carol II from the worst of his government's excesses due to seeing its value, the company grew in spite of the hostile circumstances, up to the point it reached this important milestone. Already various Romanian artists are beginning to make deals with the burgeoning company, ensuring a stable growth in production and popularity for the burgeoning Electrecord."

romania.159.d:0 "In spite of having to tackle the additional responsibilities of governance in addition to having to lead the Legionary Movement, the "Captain", Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, has found enough time in his schedule to work on a new book; a volume that is part autobiography, part ideological manifesto.\n\nTitled For My Legionaries, the book tells the story of its founder's life from a fatidic oath in a forest around Husi to his first forays into Parliament and assumption of the Prime Ministerial office, heavily interspersed with its author's musings on a host of topics from the role of the monarchy to that of the nation as a whole. Written in a relatively curt, diary-like style spiced with various speeches, article quotations, letters and Bible passages, it proved to be very popular once published, with its first edition selling out in a few weeks (the 2500 free examples distributed to members who could not affort it notwithstanding), and demand for a new one gradually going up.\n\nThe Prime Minister himself was surprised by the speed with which his volume flew off the shelves, and was said to have entered talks to have new editions published, with more ambitious voices claiming it will also be translated into foreign languages soon enough."

romania.160.d:0 "The eminent professor and sociologist Dimitrie Gusti has added yet another success to his career recently with the publication of the first volume of his newest project, The Encyclopedia of Romania.\n\nCoordinated by him and contributed to by various high-ranking Romanian intellectuals like Nicolae Iorga and Constantin Radulescu-Motru, under the patronage of His Majesty King Carol II, the Encyclopedia is planned to encompass a great host of subjects related to Romania, and will be organized in three sections and six volumes. The first section containing the first two volumes, of which the first one, "The State" concerns itself with the State and encompasses the country's history, geography, political system and more, and the planned second one will focus on the administrative divisions. The second section will encompass Volumes 3 and 4, concerning themselves with the national economy and transports, circulation and commerce respectively, whereas the third section encompassing volumes 5 and 6 will focus itself on national culture and cultural institutions and personalities of note respectively.\n\nAn project long in the making, aided along by collaborators across the Carpathians and fortuitously finished after the Unification, it stands as a testament to the dedication of Professor Giusti to his craft and to his country. The next five volumes are slated for publication in the following years, further solidifying the legacy of him and his many collaborators to the scientific heritage of Romania."

romania.161.d:0 "University lecturer and rising star in the world of literary criticism George Calinescu has recently chosen to experiment with a more conventional literary form; the novel, and recently his efforts have come to fruition through the publication of his work, Enigma Otiliei.\n\nDescribed as a Balzacian novel, it it set in antebellum Romania, telling the tale of young medicine student Felix Sima, who moves in with his rich yet miserly uncle Costache Giurgiuveanu. There he meets Otilia Marculescu, the man's stepdaughter, alongside his uncle's sister's family, the Tulea's- and family friend Leonida Pascalopol. Felix gradually falls in love with Otilia, who unfortunately doesn't fully return his feelings, showing some preference for Pascalopol instead. All the while, in spite of loving his stepdaughter in his own way, Giurgiuveanu is reticent to fully adopt her and make her a main beneficiary of his inheritance, resulting in a conflict where he has to deal with the Tulea family and their quest to seize control of his fortune, be it via inheritance or other means. After a surprising trip to Paris on Otilia's behalf, an affair with a courtesan on Felix's end, and the Tulea schemes to seize Costache's fortune, the two youths meet each other again, but in spite of tension do not take the final leap. Eventually, a Tulea kinsman manages to steal Giurgiuveanu's wealth, who dies from a shock-induced heart attack, and Otilia ends up marrying Pascalopol and leaving for Paris again. After the war, Felix meets Pascalopol again, who reveals that he and Otilia got divorced, the latter remarrying and moving to Buenos Aires, becoming unrecognizable to her former admirer.\n\nPortraying a modernist outlook into antebellum Bucharest bourgeoisie, coupled with themes of paternity, coming of age, and unrequited love it is selling surprisingly well. Reviews are positive, and critics foresee a brilliant career for Mr. Calinescu."

After a liturgy officiated within by clerics from all parts of the Kingdom and a Te Deum by the newly-enthroned Patriarch of Romania, the royal suite and King went outside, where an ornate baldachin lay in wait before the belltower.\n\nAfter the benediction of the royal mace and crown, the King placed the Steel Crown upon his own head, following the Byzantine and Napoleonic models, proceeding to crown Queen Elena afterwards.

Within the speech, he expressed his amazement of being witness to such a momentuous occasion, long-dreamed by his country and its people, thanked the Transylvanians for accepting him as their monarch, and announced that this visit shall not be his last, for a fastuous coronation ceremony shall be held within the town, to mark the completion of the Unification of the Romanian lands.\n\nAlready plans have been drawn for a magnificent cathedral to be built and organizers are scrambling to make the event as great as possible, a fitting culmination for the national edification of the Romanian nation."

Though the flame of nationalism is still ablaze, it appears that the desire for expansionism has been finally sated. Even nationalistic parties have begun to shift their rhetoric appropiately, altough some say that this will lead to a decline in Iron Guard popularity as one of its main wellsprings of support has dried up."

Until now.\n\nAfter the end of the war, many PNL cabinets have tried to gradually weaken the Treaty with the then-present situation of the country in mind, albeit it was not seen as enough by the angered and weary populace, contributing to the rise of revanchistic populist movements in the period and culminating in the Iron Guard's rise to power, which continued this process. With the German economic crisis, even more of the treaty's provisions started to be skirted or openly ignored, and now, with the outbreak of the Second Weltkrieg, the powers that be have seen it fit to finally proclaim the end of the humiliating treaty. Taking advantage of the Germans' distraction, the President of the Council of Ministers [GetHeadOfGovernment] have formally declared that the Treaty is null and void, and that should the Germans want to review their relationship with Romania, they will have to negotiate with the Romanians on equal terms.\n\nThe once-sidelined and now dismissed German ministerial officials are leaving the country in droves as Romania is establishing proper control over its river ports and the Mouths of the Danube, having also seized control of the Danube Commission's activities on its territory."

romania.166.d:0 "The Legionary Movement had risen from a small splinter group to become a very powerful force in Romanian politics... yet it seems they may be heading towards their predecessor's fate.\n\nThe once-small group grew rapidly in size and influence, especially after getting co-opted into power and after the unification with Transylvania, however with size it also gained a lot of problems. Codreanu's highly personalistic, circulary-focused and one-on-one contact-oriented leadership style has begun to falter, in spite of attempts to temper the growing zeal of his recruits. Tightening ranks, enforcing waits and probation periods between joining the Party and the Legion proper, a lot was attempted to try and temper the ballooning Iron Guard's growth and efervescency. \n\nYet, it was not enough. Many radicals across the various factions of the movement have begun to grow discontented with the "parliamentarization" of the movement, and began to yearn for the earlier days of the Guard, when it was more militant and combative. The decline of revanchism also began to hit the Legionaries' odds by reducing the wellsprings they could tap into for support. Recent setbacks have weakened movement's unity even further and the factions that used to work together have begun to openly rally against each other. These factors, and more, have led to its own control over its own members beginning to fray at the edges, and now, it is beginning to snap.\n\nMany have begun to leave, others began to form splinter groups, and in general the once-mighty behemoth of the Iron Guard has begun to collapse under its own weight. While still a force to be reckoned with, at least in the near future, it will not reach the same prominency it once had, and it is theorized it will begin falling into the same downward spiral its predecessor, the LANC, once fell in."

Created in 1909 as a subsidiary of Austro-Daimler and initially producing licensed Westinghouse cars, the factory grew to become a developing force in the area, alongside Johann Weitzer's locomotive and wagon company. In spite of difficulties caused by the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, during which the MARTA factory had to cease production, the two continued onwards.\n\nHowever, with the Romanian acquisition of Transylvania, the future of the two became uncertain. Cut off from their old markets and having to bear with the land's new rulers, the two factories decided to move along with the times. Mantaining the Weitzer society' focus on rolling stock while MARTA began to take a more junior role, the two entities merged, in order to more efficiently fulfill their niche within the new order, taking on a new identity."

After a private discussion at the Prime Minister's residence between Balbo and Codreanu, the Duce and his delegation were given a tour of the Capital, taken to various sites showcasing the city's development; from the Belle Epoque area around Lipscani Street to the modern Magheru Boulevard, culminating in the arrival on Calea Victoriei and the new Royal Palace, where they were greeted by the King, and a joint declaration of friendship was signed. The next day, after other visits to various areas of the Capital ranging from the Inn of Manuc to the so-called "Green House", the Legionaries' Bucharest headquarters, Duce Balbo and the Italian delegation were taken to a Legionary worksite where he was shown the Greenshirts' work discipline. Later that day a state dinner was held at the Royal Palace.\n\nOn the third and final day, the delegation was taken to a concert showcasing traditional and modern Romanian and Italian music, before a second discussion with the Prime Minister, the Internal Affairs and Foreign Affairs ministers and the King.

He was close adjutant of late King Ferdinand and a military attache in London, but Carol II's 'commercialization of military life' had led to his resignation from active service.

POLITICS_MICHAEL_I_DESC:0 "Born to Crown Prince Carol and Princess Helen of Greece in 1921, the young Prince Michael was marked by his family's tumultuous life and his country's malaise after the loss in the Weltkrieg. He has seen much over his relatively short life, and now he finally takes the throne after the fierce power struggle between his father the King and the then-Prime Minister, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.\n\nA far more reserved individual than his bombastic father, Michael's profound Anglophilia and appreciation towards the British monarchy drove him to begin renewing the dramatically-weakened democratic process in his country, seeing it as the way to truly heal the grievous wounds opened in the wake of the defeat in the Great War and that the national unification has started to patch up. It may be a heavy burden for his young shoulders, but the King feels that with proper guidance, both he and his country will overcome all adversities and go forward as one."
POLITICS_MICHAEL_I_2_DESC:0 "Born to Crown Prince Carol and Princess Helen of Greece in 1921, the young Prince Michael was marked by his family's tumultuous life and his country's malaise after the loss in the Weltkrieg. He has seen much over his relatively short life, and now he finally takes the throne after the fierce power struggle between his father the King and the then-Prime Minister, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.\n\nIn spite of his bigger appreciatiion of democracy compared to his ambitious father, the Legionary dominance of his government forces him to lay low. Though he would like to eventually restore the rule of democracy in his home country and fulfill the dream of his grandfather Ferdinand, the Green Hydra's stranglehold over his country is too formidable at the present date to dislodge. While they haven't moved against him, the greenshirts have learned from their mistakes with King Carol, and now the Archangel's men keep a watchful eye over Michael's own undertakings. Though he finds relief in his interests of cars and planes, the young King faces a certain fright that if he does anything wrong he'll face the wrath of the Greenshirts, forcing him to at least silently acquiesce to their projects for now. Yet the young King hopes that some day he'll have his chance to finally uproot the Legion from its roost, restore democracy and mend his nation's wounds."
POLITICS_CAROL_II_DESC:0 "Back when he was just the Crown Prince, Carol II of Romania would've seemed like a most unfit person to take the throne of Romania, as shown by the Zizi Lambrino incident in the closing days of the Weltkrieg. His country's loss however, hit hard, and as he saw the malaise his future kingdom had fallen in, he swore to remake the country into that which it was supposed to be. An autocratic charmer par excellence, he used the small-but-rising Legionary Movement as a sledgehammer to further weaken the declining PNL and the Legionaries' old rivals, the National-Christian Defense League. Now however, the scheming King faces one last hurdle in his path towards redeeming his country; the very same Legionary Movement he once supported, and its shadowy Captain, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. As clouds gather on the horizon of the post-Weltkrieg order, both King and Captain foresee opportunities to achieve their goal of national unification and breaking the other's power, and the King, though a flawed man, will act upon any opportunities that come his way to establish himself as his country's uncontested Sun."

Now ruling uncontested over Romania, he plans to use his now-unassailable position to build Romania up into a true regional powerhouse, based on strong industry, bountiful agriculture, flourishing culture and united beneath its King's firm hand and unwavering gaze. Come what may, the united Romanian people shall be led forward to a bright future, and they will forever be indebted to their visionary monarch's guidance."
POLITICS_CANTACUZINO_DESC:0 "A scion of the ancient princely Cantacuzino family claiming descent from the Byzantine Kantakouzenos dynasty, Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino is a very atypical nobleman. A firm believer in the precepts of the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Cantacuzino made himself remarked in numerous nationalist student congresses, holding fiery speeches denouncing what he saw as blights over his country. Rapidly rising through the Legionary Movement's ranks, becoming a member of the Captain's inner circle and making himself known as a theorist and as an efficient organizer, Cantacuzino became a minister in the Captain's cabinet after their rise to power. Cutting his teeth even more in the Spanish Civil War, the Prince returned home only to become embroiled in the escalating conflict between the Captain and the King.\n\nShocked by the assasination of Codreanu, Cantacuzino joined the fight, rallying many Legionaries to the cause and helping reorganize the movement for the struggle, emerging as a front-runner for the succession of the Captain. Soon enough, the zeal of the Archangel's men won out, and now the barred cross flies true above all of Romania once more. Having asserted himself as worthy of the position, the Legionary Senate has confirmed him as the Captain's successor, and now he stands ready to implement his vision over all of Romania, as its Conducator and Regent."
POLITICS_NICOLAE_I_DESC:0 "Born in 1909, the fourth child of King Ferdinand and Queen Maria of Romania, Prince Nicolae seemed set for an easy life. Free from the responsibilities associated of the eldest son –albeit some scares like the Lambrino scandal did result in discussions on whether to begin grooming Nicolae for rulership-, the younger Prince developed a passion for sports, cars and high-society life. In spite of his mother’s protests, he fell for a woman, Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti, daughter-in-law to liberal politician Nicolae N. Saveanu, who divorced her then-husband to be by her new beau’s side. Unlike his brother however, Nicolae married his lover outright, violating the Statute of the Royal House and creating a rift between him and his brother; a rift that would lead him to make overtures towards the Legionary Movement.\n\nAfter his brother’s abdication, Nicolae agreed to a deal between him and the ascendant Legionaries where he would take the throne if the Statute of the Royal House was modified accordingly to legitimize his marriage to Ioana. Now, as King, he continues to not show much interest in political affairs, preferring to focus on his own undertakings and hobbies instead."
