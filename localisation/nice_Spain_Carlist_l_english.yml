### National Foci ###

CAR_foreign_focus:0 "Ratify the Mediterranean Bloc"
CAR_foreign_focus_desc:0 "Ideas of a bloc of Mediterranean nations have been tossed around for years, at least since after the Weltkrieg. With our government stabilized, we can finally form a alliance of our own, and restore Spain's honorable position in Continental affairs."
CAR_invite_italy:0 "The Italian Question"
CAR_invite_italy_desc:0 "The Italian Peninsula has been divided since the end of the Weltkrieg, with republicans and socialists in the north, and kingdoms in the south, it is time we take a side in the Italian Conflict, though now we must ponder which government we will support."
CAR_invite_croatia:0 "Support Illyrian Claims"
CAR_invite_croatia_desc:0 "After Centuries of Austro-Hungarian Rule, Croatia has been freed, as another strong Mediterranean nation, and a majority Catholic one at that, it is no wonder why many people want them in our alliance."
CAR_invite_austria:0 "Support the Austrians"
CAR_invite_austria_desc:0 "Austria, long the bulwark of christianity, and a fellow majority catholic nation is an ideal ally, the Illyrians however, will likely not be receptive to any overtures if we seek their aid."
CAR_invite_portugal:0 "Protect Portugal"
CAR_invite_portugal_desc:0 "The collapse of the British Empire has left Portugal without any major ally, which resulted in a series of unstable governments, and continued harrassment from the Kaiser's African colonies, if we manage to convince them, not only would our western border be secured, we would gain a strong ally in our war against the Syndicalists."
CAR_invite_france:0 "Recognize National France"
CAR_invite_france_desc:0 "Even the Alfonsites were smart enough to know the French State in Algiers is the rightful government of France, although for whatever reason, the illegitimate king always stayed one step away from a formal alliance, with the anarchists now defeated, we can fix that mistake."
CAR_french_restoration:0 "The Second Reconquista"
CAR_french_restoration_desc:0 "Pelagius began the first Reconquista against the Muslim invaders in 718, however new invaders have taken Europe, the once great empires of Britain, France, and Italy have fallen to Godless Syndicalism, now Javier the 1st has called a new reconquista, to defeat this new menace."
CAR_invite_brazil:0 "Help Brazil"
CAR_invite_brazil_desc:0 "The Second Brazilian Empire has recently been revived after a major Integralist electoral victory, but now is alone without allies in an increasingly revanchist South America, and although they aren't in the Mediterranean, they have expressed interest in joining our alliance."
CAR_strike_german_scum:0 "Anti-German Claims"
CAR_strike_german_scum_desc:0 "After our humiliating defeat by the Americans, the false king sought fit to sell off the last Asian provinces we had left, the Caroline Islands. However, some are pointing south towards our historical enemies, who are now protected by the Germans as a means of expansion in our efforts to revive our great empire."
CAR_help_pope:0 "Our Papal Obligations"
CAR_help_pope_desc:0 "The Spanish spirit has always had the Catholic spirit within it. That is why we must move towards a greater connection with the Papal States. Together, Madrid and Rome shall stand together!"
CAR_bay_of_pigs:0 "Reinvade the Caribbean"
CAR_bay_of_pigs_desc:0 "The Americans were wrong in thinking that the Cubans needed independence, since when independence was brought upon them by force, the Americans saw fit to take the rest of our empire for themselves, they came as conquerors, but we shall come back as saviors, and perhaps we shall stop by some other islands as well."
CAR_proclaim_empire:0 "The Empire Restored!"
CAR_proclaim_empire_desc:0 "Spain has long desired an empire of our own, it has been our destiny since the Kingdom was formed, and now we stand the sole power of Europe. In the mountains of North Africa, they said the Moroccans could never be tamed. Now they say nothing. Now they fear us, they fear us like a force of nature untamed, a force that destroys everything in it's path. Dios rey y patria!"
