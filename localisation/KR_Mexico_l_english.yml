### Events - start up ###

mexico.1.t:0 "Mexico in 1936"
mexico.1.d:0 "Mexico has been transformed in the recent years. In 1910 the Mexican Revolution began against Porfirio Díaz and would last nearly a decade. By 1917 Venustiano Carranza had become the president, however, he quickly proved to anger other revolutionaries when he embarked on a campaign to destroy his political rivals including Zapata. This would lead to the Plan de Agua Prieta by a number of military and political leaders and lead to Álvaro Obregón to becoming the President of Mexico. From here the chaos of the revolution would wind down as the government of Mexico began a period of stabilisation.\n\nThe first term of Álvaro Obregón would see improved relations with the United States, especially after Pancho Villa was made Ambassador to the Commune of France and Adolfo de la Huerta was able to finally get the Yankees to recognize the current government of Mexico as the legitimate government of Mexico. The economy would start to be improved especially in the south where Zapata held power and was able to implement the land reforms more comprehensively than they were being implemented elsewhere in the country. Obregón would work to improve labor rights though this would spark a new conflict between the two big unions - Confederación Regional Obrera Mexicana or CROM and the more syndicalist Confederación General de Trabajadores or CGT. However, all was not well in Mexico there was the growing tension from the Catholic population due to the draconian anti-clerical laws that were written into the Constitution against the Catholic Church.\n\n"
mexico.1.a:0 "Long live Mexico."

mexico.300.t:0 "Mexico in 1936"
mexico.300.d:0 "Obregón would be succeeded by Adolfo de la Huerta who would continue for the most part the same general policies as Obregon. However, his term would have a number of international incidents for him to deal with. Notably the British Revolution and the subsequent Great Depression in the United States which would send shock-waves down southward and effect the economy of Mexico. This would all trigger conflicts in Central America, notably in Nicaragua, where Zapata would go and help spread his brand of revolutionary ideals southward. However, none of this was the most controversial thing de la Huerta did. That would be the rewriting of the term limits. He rewrote them in such a way to allow Obregón to run for a second term. Which Obregón would win.\n\nHowever in 1932, Zapata would be elected on a Socialist and populist platform. Zapata's term would see the Edjios improve and a major focus on the economy particularly the agrarian sector. He would work to improve the rights of the peasants and natives within Mexico. However, his policies would anger the conservatives especially the conservative Catholics; as was his change to the term limits which while limiting the President of Mexico to only one term again did extend it to five years which to Zapata's enemies was seen as a power grab. His overtures to the International would cause tension with the US as was his policy of land redistribution that he begun to implement. As 1936 dawns many wonder what form the future of Mexico will take."

mexico.7.t:0 "The assassin’s cohorts found"

###Anglo Events###
MEX.38.t:0 "The Anglo Rebellion"
MEX.38.d:0 "The vast majority of the population in our new northern states are English speaking "Anglos" who are resisting our rule. They are well armed and many fear that they will try to rebel against us."
MEX.38.a:0 "The Gringos will learn to accept our rule"
MEX.39.t:0 "Gringo Riots!"
MEX.39.d:0 "The Anglo population in our occupied territories have staged a number of protests, ranging from peaceful gatherings and illegal parades to major protests and acts of vandalism. Obviously, it will take a really, really long time until these gringos accept our rightful rule over Tejas, Nuevo Mexico and Alta California…"
MEX.39.a:0 "Riots occur in major cities"
MEX.40.t:0 "Actions of the Anglo resistance"
MEX.40.d:0 "The resistance of the Anglo population against our occupation forces continues. Once again, terrorist groups operating within the Northern territories have staged a number of attacks aimed at crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output and the morale of our forces."
MEX.40.a:0 "Saboteurs bomb a number of important factories"
MEX.40.b:0 "Guerrilleros sabotage our transport infrastructure"
MEX.40.c:0 "Guerrilleros stage organised hit-and-run raids against our troops"
MEX.41.t:0 "Major Anglo Offensive!"

MEX.41.a:0 "¡Oh! Y ahora, ¿Quién podrá defenderme?"
MEX.42.t:0 "Attack by Anglo guerrillas!"
MEX.42.d:0 "The Anglo insurrectionists in the North have launched a full-on assault against our occupation forces!"

MEX.43.t:0 "The Second Texan Revolution"
MEX.43.d:0 "Texans in the North have taken up arms, and declared the Second Republic of Texas, in the spirit of Sam Houston and the First Republic"
MEX.43.a:0 "They will meet our swords!"

MEX.52.t:0 "Fate of Hollywood"
MEX.52.d:0 "With Alta California finally ours again, we need to decide what to do with its film industry, once a pillar of U.S. capitalist propaganda. The Comité is divided between leaving them be (barring our new film censorship and approval board), expropriation, and purging the area to build something far more useful for el pueblo. While industrialising the studios would boost California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our new citizens Norteños will be upset…"
MEX.52.a:0 "Leave them alone, remember they helped finance los Villistas"
MEX.52.b:0 "Consolidate the studios under government control"
MEX.52.c:0 "Hollywood belongs to its workers!"
MEX.52.e:0 "Purge the studios and build heavy industry!"
MEX.53.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Territories"
MEX.53.d:0 "National elation over La Reconquista continues in full swing. Unfortunately, overwhelming euphoria is not without its overzealous drawbacks. Recently, certain national activists, civil administrators and other (generally traditionalist) voices have advocated that since the old northern territories have returned to us, we should likewise return the nature of their civil administration along revanchist lines - that is, the former U.S. states should be redrawn to match the pre-1848 borders of Alta California, Nuevo Mexico, Texas, even the Oregon Territory if our new gains allow it. These 'conservatives' argue that such a reorganisation would centralise administration of the old U.S. states and streamline governance over the North while exalting Mexican pride and erasing the estadounidense colonialism over Mexico's ancestral lands. The 'progressive' faction, meanwhile, dismiss these borders as vague even for the time, and further denounce the scheme as archaic, impractical and bound to outrage the Anglos more than ever. Instead, the progressives argue, the established former U.S. State administrations are already functional, well-organised and stable, and therefore should be adopted in full and merely expanded upon. Today, the Comité de Ocupación del Norte is scheduled hold a meeting and to adjourn with a decision on the matter."
MEX.53.a:0 "Conservative: Revert to traditional borders"
MEX.53.b:0 "Progressive: Expand on existing state apparatus"
MEX.54.t:0 "The Fate of the Alamo"
MEX.54.d:0 "It was inevitable that the question of that decaying symbol known as the Alamo would arise. As it stands, the Alamo is a rallying point for insurrectionists and a shrine for the old regime. Therefore, a resolution has been called for to renovate the building and thus repurpose its symbolic value — but again, this may only serve to incur the wrath of the gringos. As per the directive of the Comité de Ocupación del Norte, the Alamo will be…"
MEX.54.a:0 "Preserved as a cultural heritage site"
MEX.54.b:0 "A war dead memorial"
MEX.54.c:0 "Demolished! With urban expansion built over it for good measure!"
MEX.55.t:0 "The Status of American Indians"
MEX.55.d:0 "With a change in government it is only natural that ostracised groups will seek support from the new government in hopes of finally overturning their fortunes. In this case, it is America's first peoples, with which we share a lineage of American nativity and European colonialism. Deprived also of their territory, as well as their sovereignty, Indians now live like zoo animals in reservations, where poverty is rampant, and the Indian Citizenship Act of 1936 does not go far enough in repairing centuries of subjugation. Therefore, we should expand on the act, as it is our moral imperative that we grant assistance to the destitute American Indian and begin lifting them from oppression at last."
MEX.55.a:0 "Yes, we stand alongside the oppressed Indian"
MEX.55.b:0 "Will we ever stop enraging the Americans with all the guns?!"
MEX.56.t:0 "Status of Women in the Territories"
MEX.56.d:0 "Anglo women have taken to the streets in planned demonstrations — not against Mexican occupation, but for women's rights. While generally critical of Mexico's actions, suffragists have decided to make the best of our progressive government and have thus petitioned Mexico to succeed where Washington failed — officially extend Mexico's Constitutional rights of women to the territories."
MEX.56.a:0 "Grant universal rights for all women!"
MEX.56.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
MEX.56.c:0 "Now is not the best time"
MEX.57.t:0 "Status of Religion in the Territories"
MEX.57.d:0 "While Mexico has historically been a Catholic country, the Anglos take on the religious heritage of England, Protestantism. The people in the territories — Texas in particular — are deeply religious, so the Comité has to tread carefully on religious policy. It would be foolish, however, to ignore intelligence reports from our spy service which emphasise how the local churches are condoning, aiding and abetting the insurrectionists, many of whom are zealous Protestants themselves."
MEX.57.a:0 "Enforce Catholicism as the state religion"
MEX.57.b:0 "Enforce anti-clerical laws of 1917 Constitution"
MEX.57.c:0 "Let the Protestants freely go about their business"
MEX.58.t:0 "Status of Language in the Territories"
MEX.58.d:0 "The majority of both the Mexican and Anglo populations do not speak the others' language, which is already causing incidents in the territories. While forcing the entire Anglo population to learn and speak Spanish would be… impractical, perhaps some basic public works could assist our troops and settlers in the North. The principal subject of today's Comité meeting is: From schools and government to restaurants and street signs, what will be the official language in the territories?"
MEX.58.a:0 "Español"
MEX.58.b:0 "Bilingüe/Bilingual"
MEX.58.c:0 "English"
MEX.59.t:0 "The Reintegration of the Mexican Cession"
MEX.59.d:0 "After many years of extensive resettlement, intensive propaganda efforts and numerous crushed uprisings, organised revolt against Mexican governance has largely subsided. While some resistance persists among old militia extremists, Anglos at large have gradually come to terms with our rule and settlers are now a significant minority in the North. With Los Territorios Reconquistados firmly under our control, we've won unhindered access to its resources and industry."
MEX.59.a:0 "Finally!"

MEX.9.t:0 "Reclaiming our lost territories"
MEX.9.d:0 "In 1848, as a result of our defeat in the Mexican-American War, we were forced to cede nearly half of our territory to the United States as per the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The reversion of this treaty has been a dream for the Mexican people since then. Now, with the USA at war, this could be our chance to regain our lost lands and reassert Mexican control north of the Rio Grande, from California all the way to Texas! The Americans can only cede land they still control, however, so we must move quickly!"
MEX.9.a:0 "Demand the return of our territories"
MEX.9.b:0 "We can't afford direct conflict, just stake our claims"
MEX.9.c:0 "Are you mad? This is too dangerous!"
MEX.10.t:0 "Mexican territorial demands"
MEX.10.d:0 "Mexico has decided to use the ongoing American Civil War as an opportunity to reclaim the territories they lost to us due to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo! How should we react?"
MEX.10.a:0 "Cede disputed territory, we can't afford another front"
MEX.10.b:0 "Never! Those lands are American!"
MEX.11.t:0 "The Americans refuse our demands"
MEX.11.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the United States has refused to accept our rightful territorial claims. What shall we do now?"
MEX.11.a:0 "War will solve this!"
MEX.11.b:0 "We are not ready for war"
MEX.12.t:0 "The second Mexican-American War"
MEX.12.d:0 "Our refusal to accept the Mexican territorial claims was the last straw. They decided to declare war upon us in order to try to gain those disputed territories by force. Now, troops of the National Guard, together with volunteers from the local population, are being mobilised to repel the Mexican assaults!"
MEX.12.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
MEX.13.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
MEX.13.d:0 "We've successfully beaten back the Americans and occupied at least part of our rightful territory. We can send their humiliated leadership a peace and demand they surrender any territory we claim and already control, or we can keep on fighting and hope we occupy even more land."
MEX.13.a:0 "Sue for peace, we have had enough"
MEX.13.b:0 "We shall keep on fighting"
MEX.14.t:0 "The Mexicans Offer Peace"
MEX.14.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of our southern states have been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. The Mexicans have offered us peace, and will simply keep whatever claimed land they already control. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper, this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
MEX.14.a:0 "Accept their claims, we must end this war right now"
MEX.14.b:0 "No compromise until we are marching on their capital"
MEX.15.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
MEX.15.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans have agreed to cede a large portion of their territory to us - rightful payback for Guadalupe Hidalgo. Any of our territory held by the American rebels we will have to take at another time."
MEX.15.a:0 "Hooray!"
MEX.16.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
MEX.16.d:0 "Our war against the Americans continues to go well. We are at a point where we could force them to turn over all our claimed land which we occupy or they still control. Shall we do so, in return for peace, or continue the war?"
MEX.16.a:0 "Sue for peace"
MEX.16.b:0 "No, we will fight to the finish"
MEX.17.t:0 "Peace offer from Mexico"
MEX.17.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. The Mexicans have offered us peace, and will take whatever claimed lands either they or we control. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper, perhaps this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
MEX.17.a:0 "Accept their offer"
MEX.17.b:0 "Decline their offer"
MEX.18.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
MEX.18.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Acapulco, in return for peace the Americans must cede all the lands under their control, or ours, which we have a claim to. Anything held by the American rebels we will have to take at another time."
MEX.18.a:0 "Hooray!"
MEX.19.t:0 "The Americans Refuse"
MEX.19.d:0 "For whatever reason, the Americans have decided to risk continued war with us rather than to let us keep what we already occupy."
MEX.19.a:0 "Fools!"
MEX.27.t:0 "The United States accepts our demands"
MEX.27.d:0 "Surprisingly it seems that the Americans were willing to hand over all of the land they seized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo without a fight. Their internal problems must be brutal indeed!"
MEX.27.a:0 "Our rightful northern lands were restored!"
MEX.28.t:0 "War against the Pacific States?"
MEX.28.d:0 "Another rebel faction of the American Civil War, the Pacific States of America, currently control an area composed of the western seaboard - this includes our rightful territories of Alta California. We should attack them immediately!"
MEX.28.a:0 "Attack!"
MEX.28.b:0 "We are tired of conflict already"
MEX.29.t:0 "Victory over the Pacific States"
MEX.29.d:0 "The Mexican army has overcome the armies of the Pacific States of America and are now in a position to demand terms. Some in the government want the whole of California to be returned to Mexico but others feel that aggressive demands will lead to another possible war in the future."
MEX.29.a:0 "Demand all of California"
MEX.29.b:0 "Demand the southern half of California"

On the other hand, Democracy has quickly become part of the Mexican culture, and with liberal and conservative parties pressuring the junta to restore at least some semblance of democratic rule, perhaps it would be best if instead of a dictatorship, we pursued a slow transition towards democracy..."

Notably it does not contain the same anti-clericalism, land reform and other radical parts that made up the 1917 constitution. It is regarded as a more moderate, more democratic constitution.

### National Populist events ###

mexico.100.t:0 "Patria vs La Raza"
mexico.100.d:0 "Synarchism as an ideology is still in it's infancy, with the main unifying factor being a resistance to liberalism and secularism. Under the Synarchist banner there exist both Legionarists following the pattern of the Iron Guard, and the other followers of La Raza. The inherent conflict between these forces concerns their racial policies. The Synarchist leadership under Salvador Abascal sees the traditional caste system of Mexico as the correct social order, including the enshrinement of Catholic priests. La Raza as promoted by José Vasconcelos proports the idea of a Hispanic race as the true ideal of Mexican patriotism. These ideas are more similar to Integralism in Brazil than Legionarism. The party has begun to split with La Raza members becoming disillusioned with the lack of support they receive within the party. How can we correct this?"
mexico.100.a:0 "We must appease these dissidents."
mexico.100.b:0 "They have no choice, ignore their demands."

mexico.102.a:0 "we have control of Tejas!"

mexico.103.t:0 "Renaming New Mexico"

mexico.103.a:0 "Nuevo Mexico is in our control."

mexico.104.t:0 "Renaming California"
mexico.104.d:0 "Alta California has at long last been reclaimed by us and we shall let the world know."
mexico.104.a:0 "Alta California is within our control again."

mexico.105.t:0 "Destroying the Alamo"
mexico.105.d:0 "The Alamo a symbol of the defeat of Santa Anna and the disgrace he brought to Mexico when he lost the state of Tejas. It should be torn down so that this shame is permanently forgotten and as a punishment for the 'Texans' all those decades ago."
mexico.105.a:0 "No longer shall they remember the Alamo."

mexico.106.t:0 "Juventudes Sinarquistas"
mexico.106.d:0 "The Juventudes Sinarquistas is a youth program that has been created by [MEX.GetLeader]. The organisation is to help train the youth the ideals of Sinarchismo and traditional catholic values. Structurally the organisation is similar to scouting groups that exist in other countries though controlled by the Mexican government. The Juventudes Sinarquistas has two main sub-organisations, one for boys and one for girls. By making sure that the youth are enrolled in the organisation this will make sure that they never sway from the government's ideals."
mexico.106.a:0 "The youth are the future."

mexico.107.t:0 "Plan for Central America"
mexico.107.d:0 "When Mexico first broke off from Spain, Central America was part of the territories that were part of Mexico. Though they would later split off from Mexico, some within the government are wondering if the reconquista should also head southward and take the central American States. Others think that what we should do is form an alliance with the central American states as a few align with synarchismo thinking."
mexico.107.a:0 "Reconquista Goes southward."

##Army Generals##

ARMY_MEX_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 8, in Anenecuilco, Morelos, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Emiliano Zapata Salazar's military career began shortly after his political activism began, when he was forcefully conscripted into the 9th Cavalry regiment under Alfonso Pradillo in 1908, where he began experiencing the benefits and drawbacks of military life. With the Plan de San Luis going into effect and the death of Pablo Torres Burgos, Emiliano was chosen by the Southern Revolutionary Junta as the new revolutionary chief of the Southern Maderista Army. His first course of action was to take Cuautla from Porfirista forces, which was successful despite suffering heavy casualties. In order to increase recruitment, he promised every soldier who signed up with him a piece of arable land for themselves in exchange for their help in the revolution, and this tactic proved to be extremely successful with the disenfranchised peasants of the Mexican countryside."
ARMY_MEX_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W José Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known by his pseudonym, Francisco Villa or his nickname 'Pancho Villa', has become a living legend for the people of Mexico. He started his adventure when Laureano Lopez Negrete, the owner of the Sombretillo Ranch where Doroteo worked, abused his older sister. In reprisal, he shot Laureano, and then evaded capture from the authorities, after which he escaped to the nearby mountains, where he was found by a gang of bandits lead by a man called Francisco Villa. He'd accompany the bandits for years, raiding and pillaging around Durango until Francisco Villa was shot in a firefight, and named Doroteo his succesor to lead the gang. Doroteo then adopted the name of his saviour, and continued his criminal activity. With the leadership of the gang secured, Villa decided to join forces with Ignacio Parra, and started his attempts to stop, sometimes violently, the abuses committed by the landlords to the peasants in Chihuahua. In the late 1910 he'd join the Movimiento Maderista, and through cunning and bravery, 'Pancho Villa' reached the higher ranks of the Mexican Revolutionary Army with the nickname 'The Centaur of the North', and even managed to shortly become Governor of Chihuahua. He'd anger the American government in 1916 after attacking the small town of Columbus in New Mexico, which lead to the Punitive Expedition led by John Pershing, who was never able to catch Villa despite all his efforts. Villa has since then played a major role in the Revolutionary army and Mexico's politics. He is a respected member of the General staff, although he's been seen lately dabbling more on politics than learning military strategy.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Agrarista."
ARMY_MEX_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 25, 1877, in Guaynas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano, born in an accomodated landlord family, graduated as a teacher in 1894 and dedicated to his teaching profession in Hermosillo and Guaynas, while trying to administrate the family business. When he moved to Agua Prieta, Governor José María Maytorena named him deputy. After the Decena Trágica, Calles began recruiting men from Agua Prieta to oppose Victoriano Huerta and in 1913 would join up the revolutionary forces to fight. Calles ended up under the direct orders of Alvaró Obregon, and became colonel and commander of Hermosillo by late 1913. In October of 1914, Calles successfully defended the city of Naco for three months, managing to hold against all odds, and due to this he was turned into Brigadier General by February 1915. With the success of the Plan de Agua Prieta and Obregon's rise to power, Calles became his second in command, and would become a vital member of the staff for years to come, although he has been seen dabbling more into politics in the recent years.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario.\n-He has a very strict moral standard, and he sees both alcohol and religion as dangerous for the mind of both his soldiers and his people."
ARMY_MEX_JUAN_G_CABRAL_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 3, 1883, in Minas Prietas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Juan German Cabral worked as miner before reaching his twenties, where he moved to Cananea, taking part of the 1906 general strike, where he met his future contacts for the Mexican Revolution. He was one of the first revolutionaries to take up arms against Porfirio Diaz and took part in several of the early battles of the revolution. In May 1911, he took Cananea and Naco, and due to this he was ascended to Cavalry Colonel by Francisco Madero himself. He would become Commander in February 1912, and in 1913 he'd join Victoriano Huerta's forces.
