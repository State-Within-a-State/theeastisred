### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HEYDRICH_MAG_DESC:0 "Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich was born into an illustrious and high-profile life from the start. Born in 1904 in Halle an der Salle, his father was famous composer Richard Bruno Heydrich, founder of the Halle Conservatory for Music. Due to his socialite parents and substantial wealth, Heydrich got used to high ambitions at a young age. He excelled at fencing, the sciences, and swimming as a young man, forming his love for learning and athletic pursuits. This along with his father’s deep nationalistic leanings greatly influenced the young Heydrich to pursue a career in the military of the Kaiserreich. Joining the Navy in 1922, he was a cadet at Germany's largest port in Kiel, and once reaching high enough station, he was shipped to the Afrikan colonies to further his career. Honing his skill hunting down pirate fleets and maintaining order in unruly German holdings, Heydrich would eventually earn the rank of Admiral, particularly showing gallantry in the wake of the collapse of the British Empire as the Kaisereich seized British Africa. Now, after over a decade of sound service, Heydrich has been given reign over the colony of Madagaskar in order to transform it into the center for the Imperial German Navy in the region. Nicknamed ‘The Beast’ by the local Malagasy and French populations, Heydrich’s grand ambition is to see his greatest project come true. Under his steely gaze and iron clad rule, the island colony shall be transformed into a floating naval fortress of the Kaiserliche Marine, projecting the Kaiser’s will far out into the Indian and Southern Oceans. His ambition knows no limits, but he must temper himself lest he fly too close to the sun..."
POLITICS_MAURICE_DESC:0 "How does someone like Emil Maurice end up in control of somewhere such as Madagascar? Born in the winter of 1879 in Westermoor, Emil's early life was uneventful and up until recently, that had been the case for most of his life, that was until he decided to emigrate to Madagascar. Emil's reasons for emigrating were not because he was persecution despite his mixed German-Jewish Ancestry, but because he wanted a change, he wanted to see the world and he thought his best chance was to board a ship heading straight for a tropical island. Though Maurice was supposed to spend the rest of his days lounging about on Madagascar's sunny beaches and continue his Watchmaking hobby, fate would not see this through. As Maurice set foot on those docks, it just so happened that Reinhard Heydrich set his eyes upon him and decided to strike up a conversation. Heydrich was quick to assume that this unassuming and modest man was seeking Asylum, which Maurice didn't get the chance to deny. The two quickly became friends on that dock and Heydrich offered a job to Maurice as his personal chauffeur, which he accepted reluctantly due to Heydrich constantly pestering him to accept. The more time they spent together made them grow closer as friends and things seemed to finally calm down for Maurice, that was until Heydrich left Madagascar. After a long series of events, Emil Maurice became the leader of Madagascar, despite reluctantly wanting the position, he has proven himself to be a competent statesman. The people of Madagascar hope that his happy-go-lucky attitude is a sign of more stable times on the Horizon, but that remains to be seen."

Maurice became one of the island’s highest-ranking figures despite his utter inexperience in leadership and governance. This of course, was intentional as Heydrich needed a useful idiot to run the colony’s bureaucracy while not knowing or caring about the dark truths under him. The Nightmare of Mittelafrika’s collapse, the chaos in the government, and the revelation of Heydrich’s horror show all took a significant toll on the once jolly Maurice, who now vows to bring justice to those who died under Heydrich’s regime, even if he has to march into Dar Es-Salaam and take out Heydrich’s fat friend too.

Many wish to see France rule the Isle once more, and the Jewish Settlers that have flocked to the Island now grow weary, some wishing for a state of their own.\n\n As well, things do get darker. Heydrich’s naval projects have come at a severe cost. Workers deaths are among the highest in the world, and has mostly failed at it’s objective to turn the Island into a massive naval base. \n\n All of the Island is tied together by Reinhard Heydrich, who has overseen the colony for the last number of years. Under his rule Madagascar has become a hub of Commerce, and the center of Mittleafrika’s vast Naval Fleet. As long as Heydrich is here, Madagascar will thrive. And even if he does depart, everything will be fine\n\n Right?"

Even here in our isolated island ‘paradise’, the tremors of this upheaval have been felt. With the rise of Goeringia, Hermann Göring’s personal fiefdom, our local governor Reinhard Heydrich has fled to aid his old friend, leaving his chauffeur and right-hand man Emil Maurice in charge of our colony here in Madagaskar. With the colony now under Maurice’s command, and with Heydrich’s crimes fully revealed to him, the new governor must figure out how to run this massive island, despite his complete lack of experience in running such an administration. Establishing his new cabinet and reorganizing the colony’s regime so that it may undo Heydrich’s evils will be a tall order, and Maurice will likely need help in doing so, but if he can just keep the nation stable, then perhaps the horrors and crimes of the Heydrich regime can be fully undone."

From the lowliest lemurs to the tallest of the Grandidier’s baobab trees,  much of our biodiversity can only be found here. In recent decades however, another strange and uncommon group has come to call our rich island home: the Jews. Fleeing centuries of anti-semitism and bigotry, many Jews have retreated to our shores to find peace and to build a new life far from the hate they are used to enduring. Their migration here is only partially by chance though, as the ever diligent leader of our island, Reinhard Heydrich, has played a large role in their arrival as well. With Heydrich’s recent “projects” getting more expensive and destructive by the day, the population of the island began to see a *significant* decline as an ever increasing number of native *labourers* lost their lives slaving away to fulfill Heydrich’s deluded schemes. The population was in free fall until Heydrich’s luck turned when one day a boatful of Jewish refugees arrived in Toamasina, fleeing persecution from some regime or another, begging for asylum. Realizing the potential of these new idle hands, Heydrich began to advertise to the world that Madagascar was open to all Jews across the globe. Offering them incentives such as work and cheap housing, Jews have now been flocking to Madagascar by the thousands for years. This has led to a sizable Jewish minority in the nation that only continues to rise as more boats arrive and more natives meet their fate in Heydrich’s work camps. What this massive demographic shift will mean for the future of our island however, no one can say for certain..."

Despite this menacing appearance, he is nearly always accompanied by one of the most unassuming members of the German colonial mission here in Madagascar: Emil Maurice. Arriving here on our shores with one of the jewish refugee boats, Heydrich was quick to label Maruice as one of asylum-seekers, which wasn’t totally incorrect given his mixed German-Jewish ancestry. However, Maurice was neither a practicing Jew himself nor did he come here fleeing persecution back home. Instead, Maurice came to Madagascar simply because he had heard of the beauties and oddities of our wondrous island and wanted to feast his eyes upon our splendor himself, a fact he still has yet to bring to Heydrich’s attention. Though he had come here to lounge on our beaches and continue his hobby of watchmaking, living out the rest of his days relaxing in the sun, Maurice was in for surprise. Meeting Heydrich on his first day arriving at the docks, “The Beast” took an instant liking to this little, unassuming man and they became fast friends. Heydrich would not let his new friend dawdle however, and nearly forced Maurice to take a job in the colonial administration. After becoming Heydrich’s personal chauffeur, the two have grown quite close in the following years, and Maurice has reluctantly proven himself to be one of the only competent Germans in Madagascar."

mag.7.d:0 "Reinhard Heydrich has always been an ambitious man, seeking fame and honor long before his arrival in Madagascar. SInce he first became the lord of this land, he has started and completed many extravagant and expensive “projects.” From the creation of expansive infrastructural systems that span the island tip to tip, to the opening of a network of work camps and factories that supply the Kaiserreich, Heydrich’s schemes have always been large and over the top. However, none of his past endeavors compare to the crowning jewel of his egotistical ambition: the creation of an island-wide naval base. Of course it sounds ludicrous now, but what “The Beast” envisions would be the lynchpin of German naval expansion deeper into the colonies in Africa and Asia and, the way he dreams it, would make himself the darling of the Kaiser and his people. By expanding ports, building new docks and shipyards, and overall covering every square mile of our coast in naval infrastructure and production facilities, Heydrich hopes to turn this island of nature and life into a metal fortress that stands against the waves and furthers the reach of the Kaiserreich. Will he achieve this ludicrous plan, no one is for sure, but what-ifs will not stop “The Beast” from achieving his dream while he still breathes."

Occasionally, the balance is thrown off and with it, tragedy always follows. Today was one such day of imbalance; earlier today in one of the drydocks at Toamasina, Madagascar’s largest port, a boiler malfunction caused by some shortsighted logistical planning on Heydrich’s part has led to a cataclysmic series of explosions that has completely decimated the area. Worse still, it occurred at the port’s busiest hours as thousands of merchants, dockworkers, and other locals were working in the immediate vicinity. The carnage has claimed the lives of hundreds, and hundreds more are still missing as rescue teams search the rubble. Even without the calamitous loss of life, millions of marks worth of damages have been inflicted on the port and surrounding ships that had been docked there. It will take untold months to repair the damages done to the port, but the lives lost will forever be irreplaceable, and the families of the victims all know who to blame: the Beast."

Among the barrage of mail regarding the incident flooding Reinhard Heydrich’s office, we received a very strongly-worded letter from one Raymond Aron, famous French-Jewish philosopher and vocal political critic. He has hounded Heydrich and the administration here over the unnecessary deaths of so many French and Jewish workers in the disaster, and has condemned our colony as a trap for the downtrodden, accusing us of preying on these refugees and using them as little more than slave labour. This is all hog-wash of course, and Heydrich has decided to not give the old fool a response. Though this will likely increase the ire of our ever-increasing Jewish population towards us, Heydrich knows best, and what is best is for him to achieve his goals through any means he deems necessary."

Cursing the “frogs and rats” that stand outside the colonial capital protesting his recent actions, Heydrich has begun to lose all reason. As the protestors grew louder and Heydrich grew angrier, a sudden moment of clarity washed over him: he had an idea. To solve his “frog” problem, he would simply remove them from the equation. Heydrich gathered his guard retinue and stormed outside the building he was hunkered down in, ordering them to systematically shoot every single protestor stupid enough to stay and shout. Once the deed was done, he gathered more guards and began to clear every single administrative building in the colonial capital of Frenchmen, radioing to other colonial centers around Madagascar to do the same. He and his men would give every single French bureaucrat in the entire colony the one thing they deserved: a bullet. After the day of bloodshed ended, the streets of every major city on the island ran with blood and not a single “frog” was left in any position of power, control, or influence. Tomorrow, Heydrich would deal with the fallout of such actions, but tonight, he could finally sleep in peace without the incessant croaking of his now dead foes."

As they have caught wind of the recent disaster at Toamasina and his ghastly purges, as well as his past history of aggression against the natives, the Reichstag has issued a clear and direct warning to Heydrich for being far too harsh in his methods. Of course Heydrich has dismissed this warning as nothing more than a slap on the wrist, and shall continue with his schemes, but not before writing a silver-tongued reply categorically denying these “false accusations” as nothing more than rumor and slander. Heydrich knows he will have to pull the wool over the ever-watching eyes of Berlin and convince them of his innocence, at least partially, if he ever wants to finish his greatest project."

Massive dockyards and ports cover the coasts, eating away at the once pristine beaches, while the once quiet jungles now endlessly echo with the sound of heavy equipment. Most horrifying of all are the work camps and plantations that dot the landscape, raping the Earth’s natural beauty as thousands of native and Jewish workers are driven to death as they are overworked to fufill “The Beast’s” enquenchable ego and ambition. This once pure and idyllic island is slowly being strangled of all its wonder, and there is no end in sight as long as Heydrich still reigns supreme."

Forced to utilize drastic measures, he has begrudgingly decided to institute some *minor* reforms in order to quell this rising instability. Basic access to healthcare and nominal rights for workers will be granted in order to (hopefully) stop the chaos and return the colony to some semblance of a working order.

Over this harsh reality, two diametrically opposed camps have formed in our provisional government: those who believe Madagascar can remain whole, and those who believe the island must be split between two seperate states. The former camp argues than a divided Madagascar would only leave us open prey to future reprisals, while the latter camp fears the inherent instability of Jewish-Malagasy interactions. Whichever camp wins out will determine the future of not only Madagascar, but the future of the Jewish people as a whole. The people of Madagascar wait on bated breath for the government's decision."

Since my arrival to this strange land, I have had drinks and parlayed with malagasy chieftains, I have broken bread with my fellow Jews who had fled from far and wide, I have even dined with "The Beast" as we discussed old symphonies and the finer things from back home in Germany... I have lived enough experiences for ten common lifetimes, but yet I still feel empty. I look back at all this pomp and pageantry, and all I can think about is the time wasted, the lounging and living I have missed. With Heydrich gone, it is now upon my shoulders to steer this ship; a duty I wished would never be granted to me. Fate is a funny and fickle thing, and it seems fate is not just done with me.

A vile and wretched school of thought that seeks to infest the minds of the Malagasy people, divorcing us from our native traditions and ways of life. We will not stand for this. However, we can not go around slaughtering our own people on the dawn of our independence; it would sully our name for generations to come and leave a mark so dark on our history, we would never be able to cleanse it. There are ways around this though. The Croix-de-Feu, or Cross of Fire, is a French far-right paramilitary organization and political party that has operated in some small capacities here on Madagascar for decades, separate from the main cells in France. Originating from France’s era of colonial rule over the island and fiercely dedicated to the destruction of their enemies and upholding their own ideals, they have operated in secret, separate from our government...until now. Quietly and behind closed doors, the new Malagasy government has stuck a deal with the CDF that is *mutually beneficial*. In exchange for amnesty and turning a blind eye to some of their more dubious activities, the government will allow the CDF to handle their shared “syndicalist problem.” Though many argue that working with the imperialists is what got us in this mess in the first place, no one can doubt their efficacy. To celebrate this newfound partnership, the Malagasy government has decided to even gift the CDF with a small fleet of older cargo planes no longer in service, left abandoned by one colonial administration or the other. Many have asked us what use these terrorists could possibly have for these old planes, and we simply replied “Even syndicalists like free plane rides.” Remember, don’t look out the windows of the planes too far, as accidents are always bound to occur..."

François de La Rocque arrived in our capital this morning to much pomp and fanfare, greeted as a hero by many. Though much of our populace hears rumors of the syndicalists and their “free plane rides,” most ignore what occurs in the shadows to focus on our brighter future, and as the CDF grows more powerful, more and more Malagasy see this brighter future to be necessarily intertwined with the French. With de La Rocque’s visit, pro-French sentiment is at an all time high in decades, and he plans to use this to his advantage. Meeting with famed French aviator Jean Mermoz, the two have become the face of French cooperation in Madagascar and today outlined a plan to restore Madagascar to greatness. In public, they serve as both the smiling and stoic faces of French cooperation, but in private, de La Rocque has revealed larger aspirations for the island. De La Rocque envisions a Madagascar free of all German traces, fully wrapped in the embrace of the French Empire and serving as another loyal cog in their quest for African domination. What will be the outcome of the CDF’s growing influence can’t be said, but the writing on the wall grows clearer each day: the French have no plan on leaving Madagascar again."

One such issue to arise from this catastrophe is the return of piracy. Both on land and at sea, these modern buccaneers pillage and plunder all possible sources of income, from our trade lanes full of cargo ships out at sea to the coastal batteries and storehouses where much of the goods-to-be-stolen are stored. Like the age of the Barbary corsairs or the great privateers of Somalia, these Malagasy pirates are ruthless and seemingly unbeatable.

With beauty and majesty returning to our lands, a unique business opportunity opens: tourism. With such unique and biodiverse land such as this, tourists from across the globe would love to see what our island truly has to offer. To aid in this venture, the government has created a new Board of Tourism to spearhead this burgeoning industry.

As His Majesty relaxed, enjoying his leisure time like any royal should, a sudden crackling disruption in his favorite broadcast pulled him from his blissful trance as a familiar voice began to interrupt Strauss’ Künstlerleben, Op. 316. “Attention to all Jewish citizens of His Majesty’s glorious Kaiserreich”, the voice declared. “If you desire a home of your own, look no further than the Kaiser’s beautiful colony on the island of Madagsakar! Aid and an easy start are given to all of God’s Chosen People!” At this point, Wilhelm had recognized the interrupting voice coming through the radio as none other than Rheinhard Heydrich, Hauptmann and Admiral of the Madagascar colony. “Join us on this pristine island and be free, once and for all, in this new Promised Land! We offer work, food, and shelter to all Son's of Abraham seeking asylum or simply a chance at a better life free from oppression,” the voice continued to blare. The Kaiser sat back in his chair as Heydrich’s advertisement droned on, perturbed over Heydrich’s arrogant display, and over the interruption of one of his own favorite songs. For now, he would let this go, but he made a mental note to contact Heydrich soon to put the young admiral back in his place. With that, Wilhelm simply switched the radio station and sipped his coffee, drifting back into a lull."
