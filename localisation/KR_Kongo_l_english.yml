### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientate Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tekeland Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."
POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikong, Pedro VIII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German’s control of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment.Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

### Ideas ###
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea:0 "Reliance on Portugal"
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea_desc:0 "For many decades, the Manikongo and the Portuguese have cooperated, bringing Christianity and Western customs to our Kongo. In exchange for allowing them to extract our land’s resources and to use our people for labor, we have gained their protection and their aid. However, the current Manikongo has long chafed under this uneven deal, slowly losing patience with his colonial ‘allies’, and many feel as though this partnership is not fated to last."
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the Kongo Kingdom, and the one, true, and rightful lords of the vast Congo. However, most do not recognize this claim, especially given our weakened state, both unconnected from the heartland of our territory in northern Angola and separated from our kin in Bas-Congo. We must reclaim this destiny, though we will likely be forced to work with the Portuguese in order to achieve it." 

TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea:0 "Defense Against Portugal"
TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea_desc:0 "With German rule shattered in this region, the Portuguese have begun to eye our lands. We must bolster our defences against these colonials and their allies under the Manikongo while still keeping tabs on the bubbling French and German remnants within our own borders, lest our nation be re-colonized before we can even attempt self-rule."
TKE_power_struggle_idea:0 "Pressures of Factionalism"
TKE_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "Within our infantile government, a great deal of political forces are at war with one another. From anti-democratic Socialists under Alphonse Massamba-Débat, Republican elements centered around Jacques Opangault and Fulbert Youlou, tribal Bateke monarchists rallied around Queen Ngalifourou, and various pro-colonial elements, both European and native, the stage has been set for great conflict or debate. This varied and dynamic political climate has cast a great shadow over our future, and now only time will tell who shall come out on top."
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea:0 "Ngalifarou I"
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea_desc:0 "Despite our republican form of government, which was declared shortly before our independence, our regime still shares power with the local Teke monarchy which served as an autonomous protectorate under Germany. Together with Queen Ngalifarou, Prime Minister Fulbert Youlou and his democratic regime hope to bring true parliamentarism to our new state. However, the Queen’s European contacts and nativist supporters may not be too keen on sharing power with a bunch of democrats, especially when the spectre of Socialism looms on the horizon."
