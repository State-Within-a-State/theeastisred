dhpart.1001.d:0 "Following the capitulation of Japan, the question has been raised of who should rule as the One True Emperor. While many within the Canadian government advocate for placing Edwards childhood friend Prince Yasuhito on the throne, more still whisper about the possibility of Edward enforcing direct rule over the whole of Japan."
dhpart.1001.a:0 "Yasuhito will make a fine puppet Emperor"
dhpart.1001.b:0 "Emperor of Japan will be not but another title to the King'"

dhpart.1002.t:0 "Long Live Emperor Yasuhito!"
dhpart.1002.d:0 "After much deliberation, it was decided that maintaining a Japanese Emperor is the best method to rebuild relations in the coming post-war world."

dhpart.1003.t:0 "King Edward Visits Japan"
dhpart.1003.d:0 "In a rousing show of strength and support, King Edward has made a point of personally visiting the Japanese Isles and making a series of speeches pointing to the shared history and culture of the British and Japanese people. Prince Yasuhito has been seen personally accompanying Edward VIII every step of the way, sending the clear message that while the Japanese imperial family is still divine it is now utterly subservient to the British crown. Many Japanese have embraced this new role, accepting their place among their Emporor as the vanguard of the British Empire in the far east, but still yet more speak of bloody rebellion in the years to come."
