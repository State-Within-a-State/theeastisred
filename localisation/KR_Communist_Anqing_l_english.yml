socialism_with_chinese_characteristics:0 "Socialism With Chinese Characteristics"
socialism_with_chinese_characteristics_desc:0 "§Y(Socialism With Chinese Characteristics)§!\n\nDeng Xiaoping thought(aka Socialism With Chinese Characteristics) seeks to reform the Chinese Maoist system in order to compete with rival nations.  Believing Maoist communist ideology to have failed in modernising  China ,  Deng Xiaoping seeks to set up Special Economic Zones , in which foreign companies can invest and compete  which opens up China to grow larger in the economic sense. Deng Xiaoping's emphasis on economic production, under the theory of the productive forces.  In the view of Deng, the task faced by the leadership of China was twofold:promoting modernization of the Chinese economy, and  preserving the ideological unity of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its control of the difficult reforms required by modernization. \n\n 'We no longer know what socialism is, or how to get there, and yet it remains the goal.' \n\n - Deng Xiaoping"
ho_chi_minh_thought_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Ho Chi Minh Thought)§!\n\nSimilar to Maoism , Ho Chi Minh Thought  rejects the Eurocentric idea of an industrialised working class as the vanguard of the workers revolution , and argues that instead the vanguard should be formed of the rural peasantry and farmers . However Ho Chi Minh added his own  expansion on Maoism , by adding Confucian and Buddhist ethics  , where Confucian self-cultivation was promoted as being a core eliment of Party Politics and Socialist life style.  The good side of Confucianism is the lesson of personal ethics. The good side of Christianity is noble benevolence. The good side of Marxism is the dialectical method."
lin_biaoism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Ultra-Maoism)§!\n\nLin Biao being a follower of Mao Zedong , furthers Maoism as his theory . Expanding upon Third Worldism and Maos cult of Personality , Lin Biao unlike Mao however believed in spreading the revolution as much as possible using the PLA - Countryside to Countryside. And  Further Views the PLA as the Pillar  of the dictatorship of the proletariat , and further more as the peasant vanguard of the revolution. "
mao_zedong_thought_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Maoism)§!\n\nMaoism , also known as Mao Zedong Thought . Is a Marxist line of political thought as proposed  by Mao Zedong. Maoism rejects the Eurocentric idea of an industrialised working class as the vanguard of the workers revolution , and argues that instead the vanguard should be formed of the rural peasantry and farmers . Maoism places a heavy emphasis on having an  permanent revolution and stressing the importance of the peasantry, small-scale industry, and agricultural collectivization."
radsoc_socialist_confucianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Socialist Confucianism)§!\n\nSocialist Confucianism, is an eclectic ideology, drawing from both the social welfarist ideas of Sun Yat Sen and traditional beliefs stemming from Confucianism. This ideology attempts to promote a social harmony patterned after Confucian social relationships, but also adopts progressive positions on social reform or outright removal of "backwards" social structures. For adherents of this ideology, the future can truly be found by using the ideas of the past - and some believe it will guide China to its true state of being, and to its rightful place in the world."
