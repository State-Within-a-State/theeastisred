LU_XUN_DESC:0 "Lu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, on 25th of September 1881. Lu sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans. At school was Lu's first exposure to foreign literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. In 1902 he would leave China to study in Japan, in which he would cut off his queue and become interested with revolutionary Chinese politics. In February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution that ended the Qing dynasty and nominally founded the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. In 1917, an old friend of Lu's, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for New Youth, a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. After the publication of Diary of a Madman, the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. He would write for the magezine til 1921. Even though Lu Xun worked in 'New Youth', he didn't become a CBP(Chinese Bolshevik Party founded by Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu )member, but would at times stay away from the internal arguments of the party. In 1921 Chen split from the CBP and formed the CSP. Lu would later leave the CBP and New Youth(Now a CSP paper) and move to the Legation Cities. In 1925 he would meet young Shanghai socialists and form the League of Leftwing Writers. The group would be advocates for socialist realism, but by 1935 there was clear factional lines occurring between Lu and other League Members. As 1936 many are concerned for Lu's health as his health seems to get worse."

lu_xun.1.desc:0 "As Black Monday consumed the Legation Cities, the cities fill with protests and strikes that last for days on end. as protests and strikes grow, every city with in the Legations goes into daily street battles. At the helm of this is the League of Left-Wing Writers, headed by Lu Xun, a prominent writer who has gain famed amongst the world but specifically gained fame around all of China for his anti-Qing, anti-monarchist, anti imperialist and anti feudalist writings. With his leadership of the League, he leads the group in the direction of organizing and perusing revolution in Shanghai and all across China.\n\nAs the Legation governing offices are seized by the workers, a new revolution is declared in which Lu Xun reads out in a speech in Shanghai that the Legations Cities are no more and that China shall break the chains of slavery for it to be free."
shanghai_revolution.0.desc:0 "As the world reaches the nightmares of Black Monday, we ourselves suffer a major economic blow caused by the collapse of world markets, as due to the Shanghai concessions relying on the Berlin stock exchange. With this subsequent major economic loss to the citizens of Shanghai, troubles starts to brew with in the workers, in which is caused by the recent loss of pay and newly deteriorating conditions for them. Its been a few days since Black Monday, but the worse is yet to come as strike action has been called by multiple trade unions throughout Shanghai. Now the in all the cities of the legations face the issue of worker strike action. Time will tell what will happen next...."
shanghai_revolution.1.desc:0 "As we still gather ourselves from the disaster of Black Monday, the strikes have continued to grow in the legation cities. Now we are faced with a choice on how to deal with the exponentially growing unrest, on whether to call in help from the major powers or to rely on the criminal underworld to crackdown upon the dissidents. We eagerly wait for the decision of the legations board."
shanghai_revolution.2.desc:0 "Despite our efforts to contain the strikes with the use of gangs it seems they are overpowered by the shear number of strikers at hand. With this plethora of chaos surrounding is, we wonder, who is behind all this?\nIt is Lu Xun, a prolific Chinese writer and leader of the League of Left Wing Writers. Though silent in the first few days of the strike, he has come out to speak against the legation government's use of brutal force at the hand of the triads. Now we see the next actions of his bequest in his mission to overthrow the Legation Cities."
shanghai_revolution.3.desc:0 "As per a few days since the discovery of the mastermind behind this mess, a new wave of strike action has started to unfold, in which the rebels (as what we now call them by ) start to push back our police and gang allies but physically fighting back with first sticks and stone but now with guns and swords. This move  has now convinced the legations leadership to flee the legations and enter the safe havens of their respective countries."
