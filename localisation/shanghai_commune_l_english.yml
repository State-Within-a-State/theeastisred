LU_XUN_DESC:0 "Lu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, on 25th of September 1881. Lu sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans. At school was Lu's first exposure to foreign literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. In 1902 he would leave China to study in Japan, in which he would cut off his queue and become interested with revolutionary Chinese politics. In February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution that ended the Qing dynasty and nominally founded the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. In 1917, an old friend of Lu's, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for New Youth, a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. After the publication of Diary of a Madman, the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. He would write for the magezine til 1921. Even though Lu Xun worked in 'New Youth', he didn't become a CBP(Chinese Bolshevik Party founded by Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu )member, but would at times stay away from the internal arguments of the party. In 1921 Chen split from the CBP and formed the CSP. Lu would later leave the CBP and New Youth(Now a CSP paper) and move to the Legation Cities. In 1925 he would meet young Shanghai socialists and form the League of Leftwing Writers. The group would be advocates for socialist realism, but by 1935 there was clear factional lines occurring between Lu and other League Members. As 1936 many are concerned for Lu's health as his health seems to get worse."
