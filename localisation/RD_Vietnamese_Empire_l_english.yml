VIETJAPFOR_Asia_for_Asian:0 "The Rule of Faith"
VIETJAPFOR_Asia_for_Asian_desc:0 "It was through our faith that we were able to seize power, unify our nation and her people, and beat the Indochinese terrorists, saving Vietnam from the vile virus that is Syndicalism. Now free to pursue our own ambitions, we shall begin the process of creating a paradise on Earth, starting here with Indochina."
VIETJAPFOR_Coconut_Domain:0 "Court of the Coconut King"
VIETJAPFOR_Coconut_Domain_desc:0 "For all of mankind’s wonders and good, war and violence have plague our kind since before we crawled out of the mud, and still to this day, it is war and petty squabbling that divide humanity and keep us from true greatness. When His Coconutship heard of the Great War and its horrors, he shed a rare tear before resolving to end such madness so it may never afflict mankind ever again. We must unite humanity and do unto the planet his will, so we ride forth to enlighten all nations and all peoples the pure and true Way of the Coconut so that we can save our fellow man from themselves before it is too late."
VIETJAPFOR_Expand_Into_Asia:0 "Uniting Asia Under Heaven"
VIETJAPFOR_Expand_Into_Asia_desc:0 "With Vietnam and now all of Indochina firmly under our righteous rule and steadily being consolidated and converted to the faith, we stand at a crossroads. We must decide whether to bring Asia under our righteous rule or to remain here and work on creating utopia in a more controlled and local setting."
VIETJAPFOR_Fate_Of_Siam:0 "Rein in the Rattanakosin Kingdom"
VIETJAPFOR_Fate_Of_Siam_desc:0 "For centuries, our western frontier has always been threatened by our sworn Siamese foe. Our two nations have fought countless wars against one another, some resulting in a glorious victory for our nation and others a humiliating defeat. With our recent efforts to solidify ourselves as the dominant power in Southeast Asia, we will finally settle the score with the Siamese nation and bring them to heel."
VIETJAPFOR_Greater_Vietnam:0 "Defending Greater Vietnam"
VIETJAPFOR_Greater_Vietnam_desc:0 "Though some of our radical nationalist lay ludicrous claims to vaguely-related peoples in South China and wider Indochina, we know that these vile dogs are not true Vietnamese sons and daughters. We must defend our pure state from the mutts of the world, and create a pure and proud Vietnamese state that can weather any storm and any foe."
VIETJAPFOR_Imperial_Ambition:0 "Rising As the Sun of the Southeast"
VIETJAPFOR_Imperial_Ambition_desc:0 "With our economic and political reforms passed and with the state largely consolidated within our hands, we will  now see to expanding our domain far beyond the natural borders of Vietnam. Our ambitions are vast, but we are determined to see them through, for it is finally Annam’s time to bask and shine in the splendor of the sun."
VIETJAPFOR_Independent_Policy:0 "A Sovereign Dragon Untethered and Unshackled"
VIETJAPFOR_Independent_Policy_desc:0 "We shall bow to the Germans no longer, for Vietnam’s destiny is all her own.

VIETJAPFOR_Our_Eastern_Shore:0 "Secure the Eastern Shore"
VIETJAPFOR_Our_Eastern_Shore_desc:0 "The southern portions of China, specifically the linguistically-related Cantonese regions, once belonged to the ancient Baiyue people and their sovereign kingdom of Nanyue, or Nam Viet, ruled under the Vietnamese-blooded Trieu or Zhou dynasty before being subject to centuries of Chinese subjugation and cultural oppression and degradation. We will save our lost brothers and unify the Eastern Sea under proper Vietnamese rule, reuniting the ancient lands of the Southern Yue with their southern Vietnamese kin."
VIETJAPFOR_Pluck_The_Peacock:0 "Pluck the Peacock"
VIETJAPFOR_Pluck_The_Peacock_desc:0 "With our flag triumphantly waving over Bangkok, our ambitious high command have set their sights on the last piece of the Indochinese puzzle in Burma. While we have historically held cordial relations due our shared enemy in Siam, the ever cunning Burmese have begun funding pro-separatist terrorists in western portions of Siam. Just like our victory against the Siamese, we will march on Rangoon and ensure Vietnam’s sole status as the master of the Southeast."
VIETJAPFOR_Pro-Germany_Policy:0 "Yield to the Western Hegemon"
VIETJAPFOR_Pro-Germany_Policy_desc:0 "We would be foolish to ruin the relationship we have with Berlin that has been fostered and developed over the years. Though they have been far from the best colonial overlords, we stand on equal footing now, and shall be able to force a partnership far more amenable to our needs than ever before, so let us bend the knee and kiss the ring of these foreign monarchs. We do not need to like them to be able to manipulate them to our advantage."
VIETJAPFOR_Reclaim_Indochina:0 "Reclaim Indochina"
VIETJAPFOR_Reclaim_Indochina_desc:0 "The withdrawal of Ostasien forces from Indochina has thrown off the already fragile balance of power that has existed in Southeast Asia. Amidst the chaos, the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia have declared their independence and the vengeful Siamese seek to reclaim their lost territories. To maintain law and order, we will march our armies westward to once again bring peace back to Indochina."
VIETJAPFOR_Request_Cochinchina:0 "Request Our Rightful Lands"
VIETJAPFOR_Request_Cochinchina_desc:0 "Our southern region of Cochinchina was occupied by Ostasien forces to help maintain peace and stability in the months following the Indochinese insurgency. Now that we have sent these terrorists running back into the remote jungles, the time has come to end this occupation. We will send a delegation to Singapur requesting an official end to the German occupation and the return of the south to proper Vietnamese rule."
VIETJAPFOR_Seek_New_Allies:0 "Secure New Alliances"
VIETJAPFOR_Seek_New_Allies_desc:0 "The ever changing political world will allow us to seek new alliances with like minded nations, wherever they may be. Looking to the North, East, South, and even the perfidious West, we will find someone, anyone, willing to work with our infantile nation, or so we hope."
VIETJAPFOR_Situation_in_East_Asia:0 "Consecrating a Pious Indochina"
VIETJAPFOR_Situation_in_East_Asia_desc:0 "Now that Vietnam and her people have seen the one true Light, we must bring our enlightened ideas to the rest of Southeast Asia. We shall start with Indochina, uniting our historically-linked people finally under one faith and within the same borders, so let us march to our holiday in Laos and Cambodia, for they need to see the Light!"
VIETJAPFOR_Southern_Kingdom_Rises:0 "The Southern Yue Rise to Seize the Tianming"
VIETJAPFOR_Southern_Kingdom_Rises_desc:0 "With the southern China -specifically the old lands of the our ancestors the Southern Yue and their Zhao or Trieu dynasty - now finally in Vietnamese hands once again after nearly 2000 years of Chinese oppression, the fall of Nanyue has been avenged. Now, a new dynasty shall rise to seize the Tianming - the Mandate of Heaven - so that we can claim our rightful dominion over all of China. The time of the Middle Kingdom is over, for the time of the Southern Kingdom has finally begun once more!"
VIETJAPFOR_Southern_Revolt:0 "Incite Southern Insurgents"
VIETJAPFOR_Southern_Revolt_desc:0 "During the Indochinese Revolt, our southern region of Cochinchina was illegally occupied by the Ostasien government under the guise of ‘maintaining peace and order’. We can see quite clearly through the lies of their government, negotiations for the return of Saigon are ignored by the colonial administration in Singapur and there seems to be no end in sight to this unlawful occupation. Utilizing our contacts to religious militias in the south, we will encourage a full scale revolt against the German imperialists demanding that they leave the country immediately. With the colonial government still reeling from the damage caused by the Indochinese revolution, they cannot be able to afford another fight."
VIETJAPFOR_Third_Universal_Redemption:0 "Guide Humanity to the Third Amnesty"
VIETJAPFOR_Third_Universal_Redemption_desc:0 "It is finally time to unite humanity in preparation for the Third Amnesty - the total unity of all religions that shall bring mankind together in a universal family for universal peace, bringing salvation to the mortal plane and to all living beings before being wiped out by the complete destruction of the universe. God the Father has revealed this truth to humanity many times, but only now by we, His Chosen the Cao Dai, has there been a group dedicated and pious enough to truly usher in his will. Let us abandon any last pretense of secular desire as we evolve into higher and more unified beings, leading all of humanity for the greater good."
VIETJAPFOR_Unlock_The_Heavens:0 "Unlock the Heavens to Usher in the High Era"
VIETJAPFOR_Unlock_The_Heavens_desc:0 "The High Era is the final golden age of the universe that the Hoa Hao theology endlessly prepares for. It is said that it shall follow our current age, the base age of Ha Nguon, that has been plagued by war, violence, disunity, and impiety for far too long, and when it arrives, all of humanity shall stand together under our one, true faith as their spiritual and physical health are regenerated as morality is reinvigorated and faith is followed sincerely by all. Only then will the heavens be unlocked for all humankind as we create a pious Hoahaoist society free of hierarchies and bound by our shared faith as each and every man is judged by a great assembly of all spirits and all mankind before reaching the beyond. However, if this paradise is to be achieved, then we must prepare more of humanity for this coming truth, so we must set aside our peace plans for now and bring the true word to all by force."




##Events###

viet-empire.0.desc:0 "As the dust settles, we see the defeat of the enemy at our hands. Celebrations erupt in the capital city of Hue, as victory is proclaimed to the nation of the defeat of the syndicalist terrorists and VNQDD traitors. All the high profile traitors of Ho Chi Minh, Vo Nguyen Giap and Nguyen Thai hoc have been captured and executed. We are now set on rebuilding our great country, with new projects on saving our national economy, albeit with Japanese help. Not to mention also finishing off the miniscule Vietminh and VNQDD rebels. The country now awaits the future of the national leadership."
viet-empire.1.desc:0 "After the securing of national liberation from the syndicalist rats, we now decide the direction of our new state. On one side are the monarchists led by Cuong De, who seek to restore the monarchy once again. The faction though is divided between constitutionalists, absolutists and cultists. Whilst also being heavily supported by Imperial Japan. On the other side are the republican forces which seek to establish a republic under a non leftwing government. Yet again this faction faces internal disagreement as some are more pro-japanese and some are more in support of social welfare. None the less these factions now seek to hold a referendum within  the capital to see which direction Vietnam shall follow."
viet-empire.2.desc:0 "After the success of the monarchist faction’s referendum win over the republicans, the time has come to decide on who to choose to support and uphold Cuong De’s restoration. The first faction is the cultists , led by the Cao Dai religion. This force within the monarchist faction promotes Cuong De’s support of the religion in its early days whilst else promoting that Cuong De shall gain rightful divinity and prestige under the watch eye.the next faction is the constitutionalists led by Pham Qhuyn who wants to allow the monarchy to stay but for him to govern on behalf of it. Many are skeptical of this, as it can be seen as a grab for power, but Pham assure’s otherwise. The final faction to say the least are those who want Coung De ro rule with an iron fist, without interference from other forces. This faction wants to see a Meiji style restoration of power, and is heavily supported and financed by the Japanese."
viet-empire.3.desc:0 "After the victory of our republican faction against the deviationist monarchists, our republic can truly function for a new era under new quasi democratic principles. The first party on the ballot was Cuong De’s inter revolution prime minister, Tran Trong Kim. He is a man that is considered quite opportunistic and weak minded of sorts. His party, the ‘National Socialist  Party of Vietnam’ is a party that uses the term socialism in name only, to attract the workers and peasants. But in reality the party is a corporatist, ultra nationalist party that is also kind of viewed negatively due to its pro-japanese submissionary stance. The next party of the Personalist labour Party, a party founded by the Diem brothers. After the initial Indochinese revolution, Ngo Dinh Diem was killed by the syndicalists. Now his brother (Ngo Diem Nhu) holds the leadership throughout his exile and return. The party promotes land rights and reform whilst also seeking a more protectionist economy. Despite not being syndicalist, rumors are that the party is secretly socialist. The final party is the conservative Caravelle Group. This group was founded as a splinter group from the VNQDD, after the Indochinese revolution. The leader Pham Huy Quat advocates similar policies to Ngo Diem Nhu but also advocates for the actual implementation of liberal democracy and religious freedom. As the ballots close the country elects…"
viet-empire.4.desc:0 "As we look toward our economic reconstruction, we come at a crossroads concerning the management of foreign investment. As of yet what is better known at the Zaibatsu, has offered new investment opportunities for our country in terms of greater industrial output. On one hand this foreign investment can benefit our national economy. But on the other hand, it can further push us under the thumb of Japanese imperialist expansion."
viet-empire.5.desc:0 "At the start of our anti-syndicalist uprising, we were sent an expedition force by the japanese empire, to help advance into syndicalist lines and secure victory for a nationalist vietnam. For the past few months they have been helping in guarding Japanese businesses and also safeguarding the pro japanese government ministers in our government. A debate now rages in parliament over their stay within our nation borders. One side prompting their instant expulsion and the other promoting that the troops remain and perhaps increase to help deal with rebel insurgents."
viet-empire.6.desc:0 "In a startling event, the 38th army of the IJA has initiated a coup against the Cuong De government, leaving the 38th IJA army also known, perhaps prophetically, as the Indochina Garrison Army, as the sole authority maintaining control over the recently reestablished Indochina."
viet-empire.7.desc:0 "As per our hold over the pitiful Indochinese peoples, we now decide on whether to formally split colonies into 3 respective state puppets. This action would be following unrest caused by famine in the region, in which new growth of syndicalist restrictions have resurfaced.  We shall put in place native leaders in order to calm the population with words and not bullets. But still we would keep a close eye on our puppet leaders to make sure they do not slip up."
viet-empire.8.desc:0 "In order to increase our colony’s production, we have decided to remove production of native plants in favor of more profitable and abundant plants of our choice. Suddenly in the North, floods and drought hit the region, causing massive devastation in crops and food production. But now we need to feed our empire, so we must export remaining crops to our lands instead of letting the Vietnamese peasants keep it for their hunger. Now we are facing a famine."
