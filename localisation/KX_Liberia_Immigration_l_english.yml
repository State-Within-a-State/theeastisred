### Events ###
liberianumbahone.1.t:0 "The American Tide"
liberianumbahone.1.desc:0 "With the carnage of the 2nd American Civil War still raging across the Atlantic, our shores and ports have begun to become filled with wave after wave of fleeing Yankees. Before this refugee uptick becomes a full blown crisis, we must definitively decide our state’s stance on incoming refugees once and for all. We can either open our borders to all fleeing Americans, or simply limit it to Blacks-only, reducing the strain and our racial purity but also angering many overseas and even some within our own nation. How shall we proceed?"
liberianumbahone.1.a:0 "Liberia is open to all!"
liberianumbahone.1.b:0 "We must retain our purity. Blacks-only!"

liberianumbahone.4.t:0 "The European Tide"
liberianumbahone.4.desc:0 "As the fires of the 2nd Weltkrieg rage to the North across the Sahara and Mediterranean, thousands of Europeans have begun to flock towards Monrovia, storming our borders as they flee from the ever-growing war. The True Whigs shall see to it that these frightened, and frequently affluent, Europeans are well accommodated for as they settle down in our seemingly-foreign land. As their homes burn and their businesses crumble at home, we shall foster them so that they may establish new roots, familial and financial, in Liberia soil."
liberianumbahone.4.a:0 "Monrovia is a beacon for all fleeing the fires of war."

liberianumbahone.5.t:0 "Liberia Opens Its Borders"
liberianumbahone.5.desc:0 "With the raging debate on immigration now settled and solved, Liberia has decided to open its borders to all poor souls fleeing the horrors of war. As civil conflict and armed struggles break out across the globe, Monrovia and Liberia as a whole shall serve as a true beacon for all broken and lost souls to flock to in their grief. With this new legislation enacted, may all who enter our borders find new hope and brighter futures in our lands!"
liberianumbahone.5.a:0 "The Gates of Liberia lay wide open."

liberianumbahone.6.t:0 "Liberia Regulates Its Borders"
liberianumbahone.6.desc:0 "With the raging debate on immigration now settled and solved, the Liberian regime has decided to restrict entry to our nation. Our borders shall only open for those we deem worthy and useful to the Liberian cause, and only true sons and daughters of Africa shall be permitted to establish permanent residence. With these new policies in place, Liberia’s security shall be maintained while still providing help and aid to those in need as they flee the horrors of war."
liberianumbahone.6.a:0 "The Gates of Liberia shall open, but only for a select few."

liberianumbahone.7.t:0 "Settlers Scalped!"
liberianumbahone.7.desc:0 "Horrid news of another violent attack has come from the Hinterlands! As our citizens continue to flood into the newly designated areas marked for resettlement, tensions have begun to flare between Liberian settlers and the Africans native to this strip of jungle. With tensions on the rise for weeks and outbreaks of mob violence being common, more horrendous news is of little surprise to our administration. However, the levels of brutality displayed in this most recent assault have been worrying to say the least. According to the report, as a young farmer walked along his morning route into Sanniquellie, he stumbled across a repugnant sight: five young Liberian settlers lying dead and slumped in a shallow ditch, all bloodied and beaten beyond recognition. Recoiling in horror, the farmer reportedly dropped his wares and ran to Fish Town’s local police precinct to report the horror at once. With the sheriff arriving with deputies in tow to check out the scene, the grisly image they were greeted with was enough to flip the stomach of  even the most hardboiled of souls. The lawmen were reported to have examined the rotting bodies in the heat of the African sun, recording the gruesome details of their find. Of all the injuries, most striking was the clear lack of scalp on any of the victims; their stark white skulls nearly shining in contrast to the surrounding pile of matted hair and clumpy flesh. With the lack of scalp as well as the torn clothing and ragged lacerations covering the body, the victims were nearly too beaten and damaged to be identified. As word of this savage attack reaches the ears of the wider public, a surge of outrage has racked the state. Though causing more instability and further revealing the extent of our insurrection issues, these attacks have also had the positive side effect of increasing our manpower reserves as thousands of angry Liberians take up arms to avenge these poor innocents lost. Nothing unifies a population more than an attack on one of their own, and this is again proven as Liberians across the nation enlist in record numbers, ready to raise fist and rifle as one in response to these terrorists. With our swelled numbers and growing unity in the face of their attacks, the savages that seek to undermine our rule have just started the countdown to their own destruction."
liberianumbahone.7.a:0 "United in the face of savagery, Liberia stands ready..."

liberianumbahone.8.t:0 "Native villages reduced to ash"
liberianumbahone.8.desc:0 "The men marched through the ruined forum at the center of town, dust and ash billowing underfoot with each step. Armed with European and American made rifles, the group continued their sweep, scanning every burnt-out house and collapsed structure for signs of life. What these soldiers of the Frontier Force would soon realize was that no signs of life would be found, as they were the last living souls in these abandoned and scorched ruins. This village once housed hundreds of native Liberians, all eaking out a meager existence in the Hinterlands, but now only these six soldiers remained to breathe life into the smokey, ash-filled air. As with other villages, the Frontier Force was summoned to the town by the administration in Monrovia, seeking to expedite the departure of the natives and to give them the extra “incentive” to move, if needed, through the barrel of a gun or the wave of a torch. However, as with many other villages these soldiers or others like them have visited, the populace would not leave their homes in peace, and so the armed men brought down the full force of their civilizing mission upon the heads of the natives. Setting storehouses and family homes ablaze, the village and all within were soon consumed in a hellstorm of fire until all that was left was cinders and coals, with the inhabitants lucky or smart enough fleeing north to lands yet untouched by the settlers while those unfortunate or stupid enough to stay were lost to the amber glow of the inferno. As they continued their fruitless search, the men pondered on where next Monrovia would send them, each ready and willing to continue their death march until these lands were cleared of all savages, for Liberia will be the home of civilization on this Dark Continent, and the Frontier Force will make sure of it, even if it means razing every last native village to the ground to do so."

Now drawing ire and public ridicule for methods and curriculum they compare to the American’s Indian boarding schools, our local school systems aimed at ‘Liberianizing’ the native youth of these wildlands have utterly and completely failed. Designed to subtly assimilate these savage pre-adolescents while also stealing a generation away from the natives to weaken their positions forever, the schools have failed at every benchmark. Not only are these academies failing at actual education, they also are rife with rampant abuse, abysmal conditions, poor teaching staff, and the effects of underfunding to name a few issues. It is not even uncommon for children to occasionally die in their ‘care’ due to the abhorrent atmosphere. Though these problems didn’t just appear overnight, the pressure over them nearly has as much of this information was kept in the dark from the settlers and civilized citizens of Liberia for some time, hoping to save face for the new administration.

Unlike typical boarding schools of Europe, these institutions worked as covert assimilation centers for a generation of new native African youth, indoctrinating them into Americo-Liberian life, with admittedly varying levels of success. With his administration toiling in secret for months to raise the standards of the schools, seeking to increase success rates of our indoctrination of the native youth, the results have been favorable but mixed with only a few schools reaching the level of favorable results that Monrovia’s institution enjoyed. To ensure a pleasant image to the masses, this class was chosen for the graduation ceremony specifically as they are primary star pupils. With the media chomping at the bit for a new story and the masses eagerly awaiting, President [Root.GetLeader] delivered his speech to an energetic crowd, announcing the 'boundless' success of Liberia's boarding school system, hiding the varied results from their prying eyes.

liberianumbahone.36.desc:0 "As the process of integrating the American refugees from the various civil war factions continues, it appears that a small, albeit loud, minority of the refugees refuse to let bygones be bygones. Over the last several months, refugees who belonged to the Federalist and Longist camps had been having small scale brawls, which while horrible, would at worst result in a black eye or a few broken bones. Yesterday's brawl however, was the first to result in death, and is the first brawl that has caught the eye of the government. While the details are still being worked out due to how recent the incident was, for the most part it appears to have been a fairly simple occurrence. As the brawl was heating up, according to reports, a Longist(although some accounts claim that they were from a nearby Syndicalist shanty town) produced a firearm and shot a 25 year-old man, believed to be a Federalist. Following the man's death, the brawl become a literal riot, only being put down after a detachment of the Frontier Force happened to pass by on patrol.\nWhile something like this was bound to happen at some point due to the sheer difference in ideology among the Exiles, it places our government in an awkward situation. Clearly some action must be taken to punish those responsible and ensure order and unity among the Exile communities. Just what to do however, is a highly controversial subject within the halls of power.\n Some, especially Exiles we have incorporated into our government since their arrival, want us to give the Exile communities charge over dealing with this whole situation. After all, it was an Exile who killed an Exile, which should not be an affair we should have to deal with. Besides, the Exiles are growing tired of being ruled by a 'foreign' party, by granting them autonomy in affairs like this, we'd be ridding ourselves of a future conflict between our two populations. Others within the halls of power, mostly supported by the Old Guard of Liberian politics, want us to directly intervene in Exile political life to deal with these troublemakers. Blood was shed on Liberian soil, it matters little that the killed and the killer are both American exiles. While this will for sure be an unpopular move, if we truly want to make the Exiles into Liberian citizens, it is a move we must make."

liberianumbahone.37.desc:0 "With the number of American Exiles that fill our borders increasing with each new boatload that pulls into the Monrovian docks, their influence and boldness has increased as well. One of their more repeated complaints has been the strict voting laws here on the Windward Coast. In Liberia, voting is currently only open to land-owning males, at least 21 years of age, that reside in the official Liberian states, with women and any provincial population being completely barred from political participation. Comparatively, America passed their 19th Amendment in 1919, giving women across the nation the ability to vote. The Exiles, all having tasted the sweet nectar of true democratic participation, now clamor for total suffrage to reach the masses of Liberia, regardless of their gender or whether they live in the states or the provinces of the Hinterland. How shall we respond?"

liberianumbahone.38.desc:0 "With the political situation of Liberia having stabilized, the horrors of the Weltkrieg largely over, and the effects of Black Monday and the Great Depression now just fading memories fading into the past, Liberia’s government can now tackle important but less-pressing policy points for the first time in over a decade. Most clamored for by the masses of Liberia is over the issue of women’s suffrage, as it is currently impossible to vote in Liberia unless you are an land-owning, of-age male (21 being the current voting age) living in one of the nations official states. The plan for this issue currently being debated on within the Liberian government would, if passed, grant voting rights to all women that reside in the states total suffrage, enfranchising hundreds of thousands of Americo-Liberian women across the nation. Though this would greatly disturb many more conservative elements within our nation, particularly within the ranks of the Masonic Order, it would grant President [LIB.getleader] a great boost to his popularity and leverage with the Liberian people. Only the voters can decide now, with Liberians across the nation eagerly awaiting the final votes to be counted. As the night draws to a close, the final verdict is about to be announced.

liberianumbahone.39.desc:0 "Though packed with other resolutions having to do with minor judiciary and senatorial reform, the most hotly debated article of this possible amendment would grant all of-age adults within Liberia the right to vote. This would do away with restrictions like needing to own land or needing to live in the states as opposed to the provinces, enfranchising a majority of the Liberian population and finally giving them a voice. Landowning requirements would instead be shifted to the list of requirements for becoming a senator or holding higher public office, effectively locking out many undesirables from governmental positions while still appeasing the masses with the allure of total suffrage. The final decision is in the voters’ hands now, and so the nation awaits the final votes to be counted. As the night draws to a close, the final verdict is about to be announced. It seems that..."
