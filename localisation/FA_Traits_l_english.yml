MAF_goering_loyalist:0 "Göring Loyalist"
MAF_goering_loyalist_desc:0 "Serving as a member of Hermann Göring’s inner-circle, this general has proven himself to be loyal to Africa’s Bavarian madman over all others. Though this loyalty is not openly displayed within the regular hierarchy of Mittelafrika, all those close to Göring know it to be true. Like a dark and insidious web, these loyalists have spread throughout Africa and obey their charismatic leader over the word of any Staathalter or Kaiser. Fiercely loyal and experienced in warfare and colonial suppression, these members of Göring’s clique are a force to be reckoned with."
MAF_old_guard:0 "Alten Kämpfer"
MAF_old_guard_desc:0 "The ‘Alte Kämpfer’, or Old Fighters, are a group of colonial administrators and generals prominent in Mittelafrika. Standing as the veterans of both the Weltkrieg and the Kaiserreich’s first forays into the Dark Continent, this Old Guard serves as the upper echelon of Mittelafrika’s hierarchy. Both respected by all and reviled by many for standing as a roadblock to real changes in Mittelafrika, these Old Fighters are the foremost Kaiser loyalists in the colony, as well as his most trusted colonial servants."
