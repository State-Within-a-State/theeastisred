goering.1.t:0 "In at the Castle"
goering.1.d:0 "Somewhere in the jungles of Goeringia, a monstrous fortress towered above even the tallest of tree canopies. At first glance, it would seem that nobody was home, but in a remote corner of the structure, a dim light flickered. Hermann Göring, a veteran fighter ace and ruler of a territory twice the size of Germany proper, smoked a cigar in his office as thunder rumbled outside. Every boom lit up the walls of his room, displaying the diverse array of wall mounts present, ranging from lions to giraffes to hippos, and everything in between. Göring sighed as he signed off on yet another document condeming a pygmy tribe to execution by firing squad. It was an unfortunate thing to have to do, but the tribes had only gotten in the way of his plans to transform Goeringia into his personal domain: they left him no choice. Soon, he thought, Goeringia would be the most developed region in Afrika, thanks in no small part to his connections in German industry. Still, Göring was not content. There was much more to do, and he did not wish to disappoint the Kaiser and lose his position. His rivals had crowded around him for years, even after he sent his secret police to kidnap their families. For every one he had disappeared, two more popped up. Göring studied the jungle outside his window. The thunder that shook the jungle now was almost symbolic of the crises he faced, but Göring knew that with enough determination, he would endure the coming crisis, just as his jungle would. Absolute power was what Göring craved most and he would not allow anyone to steal it from him in this last hour."
goering.1.a:0 "Where did I put the morphine?"

goering.2.t:0 "Don't Get High Off Your Own Supply"
goering.2.d:0 "It was on a particularly busy day that Herman Göring sat in his castle office, wishing he had his next supply of morphine from Germany. As his advisors droned on about native workers being eaten by lions, Göring grew bored and began to daydream. He recalled that it was during the Weltkrieg that thousands of soldiers were afflicted by the "soldiers disease", otherwise known as morphine addiction. However, Germany had been a hotspot for morphine since its creation in the region in 1804. Göring remembered how he himself developed an addiction to the substance after an accident in 1923, and the prolific supply of poppy straw from the Ottoman Empire had meant that Göring has had access to it ever since. Just when he thought he couldn't stand the incessant complaints of his advisors anymore, his secretary burst into the room with a fresh supply of morphine. Göring sighed with relief and made a mental note to refrain from shooting this secretary's captive brother later. He loaded it into his favorite gold-plated syringe and prepared his arm. As he injected the sweet substance into his veins, he felt all his pain begin to subside. Now he could be the man he was meant to be, and he quickly dismissed his useless advisors, opting to begin signing the mountain of paperwork on his desk immediately."
goering.2.a:0 "No pain, plenty of gain?"

goering.3.t:0 "Rampage"
goering.3.d:0 "Lavish parties were a prime feature of the Göring castle experience, as any visitor to the fortress would happily tell anyone who asked. Tonight was no different in that regard, as Hermann Göring prepared to entertain business representatives from several German industrial companies as well as a few from the aviation industry. Göring had decided to dress up as a medieval hunter for this occasion, adding a working crossbow as yet another layer of his extravagent costume. He hoped to impress his guests with his skills in archery, but his desire to impress his guests was met by his own craving for pleasure. Göring sighed with relief as he leaned down to snort the meth line he had carefully organized on his desk, telling himself that this would be yet another successful party. At dinner, he felt a familiar sense of liveliness in his veins, and any doubt regarding his future success in Goeringia and beyond quickly faded. Despite his relaxed mood though, he soon began to sweat. This was not uncommon in Goeringia, but he found himself becoming increasingly frustrated and began pulling at his costume. As his guests talked mindlessly about their profits or the newest advances in German technology, he began to stare at each of them with his eyes narrowed. How could he ensure these men were not making the same offers to his rivals? When he realized he could not, he had finally had enough; Göring stood up, loaded an arrow into his crossbow, and shot it through the chest of the guest directly across from him. Laughing, Göring told his servants to close the only doors out of the room and methodically killed the rest of his guests. When it was over, Göring stood by the window, studying the broken body of a guest who had attempted to create their own escape. He shot a few arrows into the limp body for good measure and smiled with satisfaction, thinking it had been a successful party after all."
goering.3.a:0 "This is the most fun i've had in a long time!"

goering.4.t:0 "The Most Dangerous Game"
goering.4.d:0 "Herr Bauer was a representative from Krupp Industries, ostensibly traveling to Dar es Salaam to promote closer ties between Goeringia and the German Empire. However, when his plane arrived, he was taken for a two hour drive through bumpy white paths that could barely be considered roads, until finally arriving at the Göring castle residence. Hermann Göring himself greeted Bauer at the door, wearing an outfit that seemed more fitting for a safari than a formal meeting. Indeed, Herr Bauer was told that the two men would be going on a hunt as soon as the new arrival changed into more fitting attire. Later, as the pair set out on foot, Bauer found himself wondering why they were hunting so close to the castle. His thoughts were interrupted, however, by the buzzing of mosquitoes around his face. In the time it took to swat them away, he had almost lost track of Göring, who was apparently far more fit than he looked. The host called out to Bauer to keep up, lest he lose any chance of bagging his own kill by the end of the hunt. Bauer hurried to catch up, wondering when they would get a chance to discuss real business, but Göring stopped his guest, shushed him, and pointed to a clearing that was barely visible through the dense vegetation all around them. Bauer was barely able to glimpse something-a paw, a tail perhaps-before it disappeared. Göring grunted and carefully pursued whatever it was, and the uncomfortable businessman did his best to follow. As he ran through the brush however, Bauer tripped over something in the ground, falling face first into the dirt. He looked behind him at his feet, wanting to see what it was that had tripped him, but as soon as he saw it, he stood up and ran, ran until he slammed into Göring. The heavier man turned and shook him, asking what the problem was. Before he could tell Göring about the skull though, he saw the negro on the forest floor, blood flowing from a bullet wound in his neck. It was only then that Herr Bauer understood what they had been hunting."
goering.4.a:0 "Business sure is different in Goeringia"

goering.5.t:0 "Dinner and Drinks"
goering.5.d:0 "Ever since the day Mittelafrika fractured, Hermann Göring had taken a liking to cooking. It was one of the only hobbies he had that gave him a feeling of peace. Today was no different, as Göring took it upon himself to prepare dinner for his guests. Tonight, the dish would be Bratwurst, made fresh from his own pork. He was convinced it had to be a meal of stellar quality, for these were not just any guests; they were his rivals. Herr Bauer was among the men who would be joining him, though he was not a rival. Bauer was worse than a rival; he was useless, and had been ever since the hunting trip between the two sent the man into shock. Göring sighed and sprinkled the cyanide on all the Bratwursts except for his own, on which he sprinkled cocaine insteaad. As he opened the doors to the dining room, still wearing his apron, he smiled at his seated guests. It saddened him that none of the men in the room seemed as happy to see him as he was happy to see them, but that just meant they meant business. Göring shook his head and served everyone a dish with the sausage and seated himself with his own serving, the one with cocaine on it. He encouraged his guests to smell the oh-so-delicious food as he leaned down and sniffed the entirety of the Bratwurst. His guests were disconcerted by this move, but they did so as well, not wanting to anger their host. As the men ate, Göring watched as each succumbed to the cyanide, with Herr Bauer, the last alive, trying to drink from his glass to save himself, only to realize it was blood he was consuming instead of wine. Göring suddenly felt heat on his face, as he often did after snorting cocaine. He called his servants to bring in some ice, plopped it in his blood juice, and drank it all down in one gulp."
goering.5.a:0 "That really hits the spot!"

goering.6.t:0 "A Life of Luxury"
goering.6.d:0 "As Hermann Göring lay awake in bed one night, he realized that he was missing something. He had control over a large chunk of the former Mittelafrikan colony, was becoming the richest man on the continent, and had servants to tend to every whim or need. Göring could not place his dissatisfaction until he thought of all his extravagent outfits. Beautiful as they may be, he had little else to give life to his castle. Even his office was limited to a few wall mounts, and that room badly needed redecoration. Göring stood up, careful not to disturb his wife, and left the room. He called a meeting of his most trusted advisors, despite it being the middle of the night, and when everyone was seated, he began. He told his audience of eye-rubbing old German men that he wanted to build a new pool of massive size, with tiles made of gold making up the pool floor. A few of his advisors shook their heads in confusion at this request, obviously not comprehending Göring's brilliance. To go along with this pool, he demanded a motorized surf board, so he could traverse his pool in comfort. His next requests were for Giraffe-skin rugs in every room of the house, a golden cigar, and a pair of eye-massagers, which would puff air into his eyes to relieve them after a long day of work. Next, he was now wealthy enough to buy his own personal tank, and he demanded this be done at once: the roads were becoming too bumpy as of late and he wanted to smoothen them out himself. Seeing one advisor drift off to sleep, Göring pulled out his pistol from his robe and shot the man three times in the torso. When the deed was done, Göring sat in his chair, put his feet up on his servant boy's back, and lit a cigar, smiling at the now wide-awake advisors. "
goering.6.a:0 "We've got work to do!"

goering.7.t:0 "The Finer Things"
goering.7.d:0 "Hermann Göring was one of the few clever men who had profited from the collapse of Mittelafrika, and he had done it by transforming the drug trade to serve his own ends. In fact, Göring had turned the African drug trade into the most profitable of its kind on Earth, but it was no easy task. Regardless, the collapse of Mittelafrika meant the elimination of any regulations regarding drug production, sale, and consumption. This helped immensely, but what also helped was the region's natural richness in methamphetamines, among other drugs or drug ingredients. While Göring still forbade his soldiers from smoking cigarettes, nearly everyone in Goeringia, native or otherwise, knew someone involved in the rapidly growing trade, and Göring was now considered the richest man on the continent. He was wealthier than the Sultans of Egypt and Morocco, richer than any of the businessmen in National France, and certainly towered over any of his rivals in the other breakaway states of former German Mittelafrika. With free reign over this drug trade, Göring had turned it from a ragtag bunch of delinquents into a truly formidable organization, bribing politicians, circumventing laws, and addicting hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Now, Göring was wealthy enough to enjoy the finer things of life, and that is just what he did. After renovating his jungle fortress, Göring had decided to create a hippopotamus farm in which he would keep the animals for his own enjoyment, and of course, to show off to visitors. He had the money to buy hundreds of different exotic outfits, more than he could ever dream of, and he even melted down skulls to serve as paint on one of his new automobiles. The best part about this newfound wealth is not what he is able to buy; it is the fact that his prosperity has only just begun."
goering.7.a:0 "Chaos is a ladder..."

goering.8.t:0 "Getting Clean"
goering.8.d:0 "It was the time of the week when Hermann Göring would usually receive his drug shipment from Dar es Salaam. He had anticipated this shipment less than he normally would, largely due to a doctors visit earlier that day. His doctor had informed the large man that his health was rapidly deteriorating, and that if he did not cut down on his drug consumption, he could even die. As he sat at his desk and pondered what the doctor had said to him, his wife gently rested her hand on his shoulder and, as always, knew just what he was thinking. She asked him whether he wished to continue bearing the cost, both financially and physically, of so many different types of drugs. The cost was astronomical in financial terms, consuming a full twenty percent of Göring's weekly income, and she was also right that the physical cost was beginning to wear on him. Göring's once-normal teeth had yellowed, rotting in place, and his eyes had deep bags under them, regardless of how much sleep he got on one night or another. Göring made a decision: it was time to quit. The next day though, as Göring tossed the severed head of a servant to his new pet lion, he found himself craving the sweet release that morphine would give him. Morhpine was perhaps Göring's favorite drug, as it made him feel nigh-invincible and gave him a reprieve from his usually stressful day. Now though, the only thing on his mind was the morhpine itself. It took everything he had, but Göring managed to abstain from usage. That night, Göring lay awake in bed all night, unable to sleep. Before the sun had even come up, he had vomited three times and felt like his heart was about to burst out of his chest. Doctors were quickly called to check on him and explained that he was going through acute opiate withdrawl, and that he had to wait it out. The next three days were the most agonizing of Göring's life, but when they were over, he felt like a new man. No longer did he crave the sweet release that had ironically become his prison. He was now a free man in truth."
goering.8.a:0 "Perhaps I am human after all!"

goering.9.t:0 "The Match"
goering.9.d:0 "It had been years since Göring swore off morphine, and in the meantime, his physique had recovered significantly. In fact, at a lean 100 kilograms, Göring was quite athletic for his age. As of late, he had been eager for any opportunity to show off his physical prowess before an audience, to show his people who ruled them. Until recently though, no worthy opponent had emerged to challenge him in a boxing match. However, a young man calling himself Idi Amin had trained as a boxer for years, and at 16, already towered over most men. He was a minor but ambitious warlord, rising in the border region between Goeringia and Buganda, and it was time that Göring took action against him. When he challenged Amin to a boxing match, the younger man quickly agreed, and it was set to be broadcast on radio across Goeringia. To his surpise and satisfaction, Göring learned that the match would in fact be broadcast all over the former Mittelafrikan colonies, serving as a sort of racial matchup and also one of a European colonist versus a native. Regardless, the day for the match came, and Göring entered the room in black trunks. This was Göring's first match, and despite all his bravado, he could not help doing a double take when the 6'3 man in white trunks walked into the room. The two men entered the ring and touched gloves, neither breaking the intense stare between them. Amin had told Göring in broken German that Göring would address him as King of All Beasts on the Earth and Fish in the Sea when he was done with him. To this, Göring said that he already was indeed an animal, thought he would never be fit to be a king. When the bell sounded, Amin charged Göring like a bull, throwing jabs and crosses to try and knock the smaller man out early. For his part, Göring dodged and threw uppercuts to stay on the defensive, but at the first opportunity, he stepped inside Amin's stance and hit him in the chin with a vicious punch that had the force of a freight train. Amin stumbled back and crashed to the ground, the noise echoing off the walls. Göring stood over his foe as the man was counted out, then knelt down to sever Amin's head from his body. He took the head back to his castle, and when he arrived, he placed the head in a water tank next to his bed, so that he might look upon Amin's face in times of difficulty.""
goering.9.a:0 "Ah, now who said a rival couldn't be turned into a friend?"

goering.10.t:0 "Restoration"
goering.10.d:0 "Hermann Göring could hardly believe what he was seeing. The last few months had been hellish, especially for his troops, but as Göring's servants replaced his wall mount heads with the heads of his rivals, he could not help but smile. Huttig, Maharero, von Oldenburg, and Amin all decorated Göring's office. The warlord had even managed to get his hands on the broken body of Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama, and had severed his head for a spot on his wall. Now, as Göring sat staring at the faces of his vanquished foes, he thought of all the adventures he and his men had had along the way. Firebombing the Fulani, Gassing the Gabonese, Neutralizing the Namibians, it had all been one long journey for Göring. His victory had come not from any advantage in manpower, technology, or even wealth, for that matter. Instead, he had prevailed through sheer willpower, and perhaps with the help of certain stimulants as well, which allowed him to work longer hours than his rivals. His air force was one of the best in the world, and his tanks had thundered across the continent. For the unveiling of the new wall mounts, Göring had decided to outfit himself in the costume of a Teutonic Knight, imagining himself as a heroic soldier going forth to eradicate his foes with the help of God. It seems that the triumphant man had finally achieved this goal. Now though, with Mittelafrika restored, Göring's work was not over. In fact, it was only just beginning..."
goering.10.a:0 "I will make my forefathers proud!"

goering.11.t:0 "Betrayal"
goering.11.d:0 "Hermann Göring sat in his office, and as he put the paper down, he slammed his fist on his desk. Today was not a good day. He had just received word from the Kaiser in Berlin, and reading the letter made his blood boil. Göring had sent an offer to the Kaiser, asking to be given special privileges in Germany as well as a title essentially on par with the Kaiser himself, in exchange for ruling Mittelafrika in his name. Of course, this offer was turned down immediately, and worse, the Kaiser was apparently seeking a replacement for him. Göring sighed, stood up, and slowly made his way to the wall mount of Hans Hüttig. Staring into the man's perpetually open eyes, Göring asked him why Germans must always be so prideful. He meant no disrespect to the Kaiser or Germany as a whole with his request, only to receive his proper due, and the Kaiser had humiliated him. This could not stand; this was a betrayal. Göring decided he would write a scathing letter in rebuke. Fetching his blood pen, he furiously scribbled away, writing to the Kaiser that he was in fact no ruler at all, and that he would show Germany how a true Teuton should behave. He proclaimed his independence from the Kaiser, from the German Empire, refusing to support this disgraceful excuse for a German any longer. Now it would be Göring's time to shine!"
goering.11.a:0 "Besides, can he even hold a rifle?"

goering.12.t:0 "Insanity"
goering.12.d:0 "Hermann von Göring sat atop his throne of skulls, savouring his victory. He had done it; against all odds, he had done the unthinkable; conquer the entirety of former Mittelafrika. Yet to him, there was still more to be desired: he might have had copious amounts of money, drugs, men, and land, yet something was still missing.\n\n He thought back to the letter he received from the Colonial Affairs Ministry, offering a position in charge of a reformed Mittelafrika if he were to surrender to Germany. He scoffed at them, the audacity of bureaucrats wanting to take away the victory he fought so hard to earn. He thought of Berlin, all the arrogant men in suits who wanted to preside over a land they had never set foot in; it disgusted Göring. He thought about the Kaiser, a man who he once respected; a man who he once swore an oath to, a man he lost any respect for once he abandoned him and his men in the Dark Continent. The ignorance of the man; he wanted to be treated as King of Afrika, yet had he ever been in the continent, had he ever fought in battle to claim his legacy? Had he ever fought for the Empire in his family’s name? \n\n The answer was a resounding no. The Kaiser has no right to claim the title of 'King of Africa'. If anyone, anyone in the world, had a claim to the title of King of Africa, it was Göring; and Göring alone. He played around with the words in his head: “King of Afrika”  sounded nice, it sounded like a title he had rightfully earned. \n\n After a moment of hesitation, a moment of debate within himself, he made a snap decision. Göring was to be King, the King of all of Afrika and beyond. He had earned this title of King, more than anyone else in the Reich, more than anyone in the world. A crown was to be made, a coronation was to be held. The world would now hear of the glories of Hermann I, the rightful King of Afrika."

TNZ_rulethroughsubmission_desc:0 "Mittelafrika has collapsed and Hermann von Göring’s fiefdom seems to be the last vanguard of German rule in the continent. Against any odds, Göring is determined not just to secure his state, but eventually restore German rule to Afrika. Whether he can achieve his goal or even survive is anyone’s guess."

TNZ_gatherthefunding_desc:0 "To continue the legitimate government of Afrika, we need funds. At the moment money is scarce and funds are running low, and many doubt we can survive unless we gain new sources of income to continue Göring’s war efforts. Regardless of how we get these funds, we will gain riches once more. "

TNZ_readythesteed_desc:0 "Göring has a special affinity for anything related to the Air Force, after all he served as a pilot in the first Weltkreig. However, his beloved air force has collapsed in his home continent of Africa, being relegated to nothing but a meaningless side force for anyone lucky enough to have an airplane. With enough cash to spare to afford an air force, Göring will make sure that his air force will be the strongest and most deadly air force in all of Afrika. "
