### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JOSE_MARIA_ORELLANA_DESC:0 "Orellana's military dictatorship beginning in 1921 has grown stagnant, with both him and his cabinet exhausted with constantly having to deal with protests against his presidency, social uprisings, and people wishing for true democracy to be returned. His main focus of building the economy and fighting illiteracy has also begun to slow down over time due to some sort of opposition from one side or another. Guatemala grows tired and demands change which Orellana cannot bring in the countries current state, and a shakeup could make him meet his undesirable fate..."
POLITICS_UBICO_NAPOLEON_DESC:0 "Born to Guatemala's upper class in 1878, Jorge Ubico Castañeda has long held a silver spoon in his hand. Receiving private tutoring as a boy and higher education overseas in Europe and the United States, his pathway to high success was paved at a young age. At 19, he joined the Guatemalan army upon being granted a commission due to his familial ties, and began his meteoric rise to the top from there. All along the way, the young Ubico looked to one man as his inspiration: Napoleon Bonaparte, deposed Emperor of France. As he grew older and achieved his dreams and more, Ubico began to take this fascination even farther, actively modeling his own image and mannerisms after the ‘Little Colonel.’ Now, ruling over all of Central America, Ubico has taken this obsession one step farther, fashioning himself as Jorge I, Emperor of Central America, while modeling this Lating American state on the now-collapsed First French Empire. Frequently remarking to his companions on how similar he and the long-dead Frenchman are, both in looks and personality, many within his cabinet have taken issue with this ‘admiration.’ Nonetheless, they can do little to stop this ‘Little Napoleon of the Tropics’, for absolute power is already within his reach..."

guatemala.1.t:0 "Intro to Guatemala"
guatemala.1.d:0 "Guatemala's political chaos started in 1898, when Manuel Estrada Cabrera came into power. Cabrera's “Liberal” party had a deep control over the government, with all elections up until 1920 being rigged towards the Liberal party under Cabrera. This period also vastly increased the influence of the United Fruit Company, an American owned business focused on increasing the amount of exports towards America for cheaper prices.\n\nThis changed in 1920, when the Liberal party faced extreme opposition following earthquakes in 1918 that destroyed the industry Cabrera had setup. His lack of response resulted in the Conservatives within the country forming the Unionist Party, with the people running the party consisting of José Azmitia, Tácito Molina, Eduardo Camacho, Julio Bianchi and Emilio Escamilla, while also being supported by the Catholic church within Guatemala.\n\nThe Unionist Party prepared the “Three-Fold Act”, which was the founding policy of the party, and they distributed these in Guatemala City on the New Year of 1920. This led to an extreme rise of the popularity of the Unionists, with protests occurring outside the capital on March 11th, 1920, with the crowd being fired upon and the populace left more angered than before. The final straw was in 1920, when Adrián Vidaurre, President of the National Assembly, declared Cabrera unfit to rule and deposed him, though still facing fierce resistance from Cabrera's supporters. They thereby made Carlos Herrera President of Guatemala.\n\nHerrara balanced a very careful political tightrope due to him having Liberal aligned views while representing the Unionist Party. This tightrope snapped in 1921, when he critically upset the Liberal party by refusing to offer concessions the UFC, resulting in a military coup led by José María Orellana. He represented the needs and demands of the Liberal Party, offering concessions to the UFC the following year.\n\nThe political situation has completely stagnated since then, with Orellana ruling over his regime while balancing the needs of both the left and right. Guatemala now stands frozen..."
guatemala.1.a:0 "Orellana is eternal."
guatemala.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits us!"
guatemala.2.d:0 "Black Monday has hit the United States, making their economic recession even worse. Ripples are being felt all across Central America, our crops remain unsold and US companies shrink in size to avoid bankruptcy."
guatemala.2.a:0 "What will this mean for Guatemala?"
guatemala.3.t:0 "Legal Issues"
guatemala.3.d:0 "Several peasants sued the United Fruit Company and certain provincial governors on flimsy grounds such as having their land sold by other parties without their knowledge, local governors seizing their land for the UFC without sensible reason, and ignoring the last wills for heirless people. It is obvious that the socialists pressured these peasants, instructing them to push their claims and helping them with the legal fees."
guatemala.3.a:0 "Listen to their pleas, return the land and try to do something about corruption."
guatemala.3.b:0 "These are surely just made up excuses!"
guatemala.4.t:0 "The American Civil War"
guatemala.4.d:0 "The American Civil war has broken out! Our biggest trading partner disappeared almost overnight. UFC officials are scrambling to save as much as they can in the chaos, selling off assets to stabilise their situation. Their support for Orellana has weakened considerably; a dark cloud now looms on the horizon of Guatemala."
guatemala.4.a:0 "Guatemala will survive."
guatemala.5.t:0 "Letter of the 311"
guatemala.5.d:0 "A group of democrats and socialists, mainly composed of university students, wrote a letter designated to President Orellana asking for his resignation and for free elections to start as soon as possible. Orellana knows his support dwindled and the democratic movement militarised and started talks with the socialists to declare open revolt to bring 'freedom' to Guatemala, this letter just being the tipping point of the tensions. If the government rejects this apparently 'heart-felt' letter coming from the future of Guatemala, civil war is all but inevitable."
guatemala.5.a:0 "Start preparing for elections as soon as possible, to avert disaster."
guatemala.5.b:0 "This is just a socialist conspiracy! Guatemala will not be corrupted!"
guatemala.6.t:0 "Ubico's Coup"
guatemala.6.d:0 "Seeing the weakness of Orellana and the inevitable elections that would bring socialists into government, the popular hardline general Jorge Ubico Castañeda has entered the capital with his loyal army and deposed Orellana. As soon as the news hit the country, the democratic-socialist coalition, the National Progress Party, started taking direct control of several cities and declared Ubico's regime illegitimate, starting a civil war. Some of the more moderate people, appalled by Ubico's power grab, joined their cause."
guatemala.6.a:0 "Ubico will save us from socialism!"
guatemala.7.t:0 "Ubico's Speech to the People"
guatemala.7.d:0 "Several days after the coup, as he managed to stabilise his rule in the capital, Ubico gave a speech to the people of Ciudad de Guatemala:\n'Fellow Guatemalans, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let no Guatemalan deny the perils of our time. While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history, the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished. It is time for us as individuals to set aside our long-standing feuds and unite. The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.\nThe United States of America is no more! Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom, a memory. With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? The devastation wrought by the socialists is self-evident. We have seen our cities occupied by the National Progress Party. We have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones shackled by them. Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our time.\nThe time has come, my fellow Guatemalans, to rally to a new banner. In unity lies strength. Out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole, answering only to a single throne, and from that throne, I shall watch over you.'\nThe booing of the supporters of the NPP were drowned in the standing ovations of the crowds."
guatemala.7.a:0 "We will fight for Guatemala! For Ubico!"
guatemala.8.t:0 "Opening Strategies"
guatemala.8.d:0 "As the chaos throughout the country subsided, vast areas have ended up controlled by the National Progress Party. They are trying to expand their position in an aggressive manner, and underground cells have formed in most cities that still are nominally loyal to us. What would be the best course of action?"
guatemala.8.a:0 "Secure the temporary borders, not one mile will be ceded!"
guatemala.8.b:0 "Focus on rooting out opposition in loyalist lands."
guatemala.9.t:0 "Choosing a Target"
guatemala.9.d:0 "[getgua8], the military staff had to decide their strategy for the war. Would they advance directly on the mountainous makeshift rebel capital of Quetzaltenango, ending the rebellion fast but in a very costly assault, or try to starve the rebels by moving onwards to Ciudad de Belize and then cut them off from the Mexican border, isolating them?"
guatemala.9.a:0 "They will fall like flies, onward to Quetzaltenango!"
guatemala.9.b:0 "We shouldn't waste honourable Guatemalan lives in vain, starve the rebels into submission."
gua_8_d1:0 "After we secured our borders"
gua_8_d2:0 "After Ciudad de Guatemala and other urban centres were cleared of any NPP presence"
guatemala.10.t:0 "The Siege of Ciudad de Belize"
guatemala.10.d:0 "As the rebel defenses are overstretched, the concentrated blow to their main port in Belize went by with no issues. We registered barely any losses, and already started marching to the Mexican border to encircle whatever remains of the rebel forces, as their resources grow scarcer. While it is obvious to all parties involved that Mexico heavily assists the rebellion, the spineless socialists will surely not declare war to protect their proteges, even when their means of supporting the rebels will disappear."
guatemala.10.a:0 "The rebels know their demise is imminent."
guatemala.11.t:0 "The Assault on the Capital"
guatemala.11.d:0 "As our troops were finishing securing the border with Mexico, the rebels moved against Ciudad de Guatemala! This time it was them pouring all their resources into a final attack to make us flee from the capital and break our will. With a good chunk of our forces guarding the western border, this fight will be a hard one. Some generals even suggested letting them in the capital, fighting them in the streets, buying time for our forces to occupy the now virtually defenseless rebel land."
guatemala.11.a:0 "We will never let them enter Ciudad de Guatemala!"
guatemala.11.b:0 "It would be better for our long term goals to dye our capital red with blood."
guatemala.12.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
guatemala.12.d:0 "After weeks of fighting in the streets of Ciudad de Guatemala, our troops managed to return to the capital, encircling the rebels, forcing their surrender. Our victorious president called for a parade the very next day. Through the bloody streets of Guatemala, the troops paraded valiantly, holding the Guatemalan flag up high, to the cheers of the people, who can taste peace at last. [getgua12d]"
guatemala.12.a:0 "[getgua12a]"
gua_12_d2:0 "The government started working towards making the civil war just a painful memory, and continue the path to a better Guatemala, as they did for the last 18 years, all under the guiding hand of Orellana, our dear president."
gua_12_d1:0 "The government already started working on plans to help the country heal and recover, preparing to enter a new era, all under the guiding hand of Ubico."
gua_12_a2:0 "Long live our President!"
gua_12_a1:0 "Peace, at last. Praise Ubico!"
guatemala.13.t:0 "A Statue for Our Victor"
guatemala.13.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala is being rebuilt, the people (mainly high-class aristocracy) expressed their earnest desire for a statue dedicated to Ubico, to immortalise his role as the man who stopped the socialists from ruining Guatemala. It would be built in the likeness of the heroes of old, with Ubico on a fine steed, holding his saber forward."
guatemala.13.a:0 "We are truly grateful."
guatemala.14.t:0 "Rebuilding Ciudad de Guatemala"
guatemala.14.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala was badly damaged by the final skirmish with the rebels, a big reconstruction project has commenced. Ubico wants to make the roads better and wider, to prepare Guatemala to be a capital for a larger Central America. However, more skeptical members of the government proposed a more sensible plan, to increase the defenses of the capital, to never again have such a bloodbath happen inside its borders."
guatemala.14.a:0 "Guatemala will never again be threatened, rebuild it with grandeur!"
guatemala.14.b:0 "Better to be conservative and protect the capital from further threats."
guatemala.15.t:0 "Civil War!"
guatemala.15.d:0 "The National Progress Party has used the days since the letter to prepare themselves to declare open revolt! They managed to take over Quetzaltenango and Ciudad de Belize, with most of the land in between them and the Mexican border. The government is in disarray trying to come up with a plan to stabilise the situation and defeat the rebels."
guatemala.15.a:0 "Rebel scum!"
guatemala.16.t:0 "Disaster!"
guatemala.16.d:0 "Quetzaltenango proved to be a formidable fortress. The loyalist armies were bogged down in its defensive layers and were incurring much heavier losses than the rebels. Feeling desperate, the government sent more and more troops to help the siege. After the defenses of Ciudad de Guatemala were thinned enough, the NPP members hiding in the city came out and managed to take out the lightly protected leadership! The higher echelons fell into anarchy, with most of them escaping while the NPP took hold of the country. Hearing this news, the army, tired after the fighting, held the white flag."
guatemala.16.a:0 "Long live Guatemalan Freedom!"
guatemala.17.t:0 "Victory!"
guatemala.17.d:0 "The fighting was brutal. The rebels made Quetzaltenango into a formidable fortress. We incurred heavy losses. We needed to pledge all our reserves to the fight. The capital was virtually undefended. However, we succeeded. We broke through their lines yesterday, and captured their leaders. As most rebels were in this city, the rebellion was effectively broken. After a brief respite, the army marched in the rest of the country and made sure all the remaining pockets were defeated."
guatemala.17.a:0 "Guatemala finds peace, at last!"
guatemala.18.t:0 "The Cost of Pride"
guatemala.18.d:0 "Refusing to let the rebels taint the capital, the defenders rallied in front of Ciudad de Guatemala. The battle was a bloody one, with many loses on both sides, but the numerical superiority of the rebels won over the smaller defending army. When it was clear that the rebels would win, the government escaped the capital, leaving it open to be liberated by the NPP. Hearing this news, the rest of the army, scattered around the Mexican border, agreed to lay down their arms and swear allegiance to the new government."
guatemala.18.a:0 "Freedom, at last!"
guatemala.19.t:0 "The Fate of El Salvador"
guatemala.19.d:0 "El Salvador has turned red! While we managed to put down the rebellion in our land, it seems they have failed. Our government has decided to prepare for war to liberate our brethren!"
guatemala.19.a:0 "To Arms!"
guatemala.20.t:0 "A Policy on Education"
guatemala.20.d:0 "How should our government tackle education issues? Even if Orellana, the ex-president of Guatemala, did do much to tackle the illiteracy, he obviously has not gone far enough."
guatemala.20.a:0 "Enforce strict curriculum on the value of the working class, and the evils of aristocracy."
guatemala.20.b:0 "Leave a high degree of autonomy to each teacher, and promote meritocracy."
guatemala.21.t:0 "Dealing with the UFC"
guatemala.21.d:0 "The UFC has been the source of many issues to the stability of Guatemala. What would be the best way to handle it?"
guatemala.21.a:0 "Nationalise it."
guatemala.21.b:0 "Buy off enough land from it so it will not be a dominant presence in the country."
guatemala.22.t:0 "The Split"
guatemala.22.d:0 "Today, the NPP has ended. The tensions between Ortiz's Revolutionary Action Party and González's Union Party had reached the breaking point, and small skirmishes have broken out in the capital, months after the civil war that scarred the country. Which party will come on top?"
guatemala.22.a:0 "The Partido Acción Revolucionaria!"
guatemala.22.b:0 "The Partido Unionista!"
guatemala.23.t:0 "The Counter-Revolution!"
guatemala.23.d:0 "Ubico returned with an army of mercenaries paid for by the UFC! He landed in Belize and started to march towards the capital, while we're trying to prepare defenses to meet him in battle, even though we're very weakened due to the previous civil war."
guatemala.23.a:0 "Ubico defeats the government!"
guatemala.23.b:0 "Ubico is stopped, the revolution is saved!"

guatemala.69.t:0 "Naval Disaster"
guatemala.69.d:0 "As the Guatemalan navy finally had more than one lonely ship, they were sent out to do formation training. However, the sheer incompetence of the newly trained sailors resulted in one of the ships hitting the other during targeting training, forcing it to capsize. Fearful of an adverse reaction from the people that so much money has gone to waste, Ubico's propaganda machine tried to spin it as a reenactment of the battle of Trafalgar."
guatemala.69.a:0 "That’s an... interesting turn of events."

guatemala.100.t:0 "Nobody Had The Guts To Leave The Temple!"
guatemala.100.d:0 "The legacy of extravagance and hedonism that president Cabrera embodies still remains scattered throughout Guatemala in the form of Minervan Temples. These buildings were used for Fiestas Minervalias, a holiday of Cabrera's own design. There were children singing, dances, and very unchristian attractions to behold in those days. Now the temples are deserted, and local priests ensure that no festivities are held. This would be the end of their use, if not for our inventive government. They have proposed we convert these halls of vice into baseball fields for children, or build them up into housing. The right would prefer to see them as baseball fields, while the left sees our housing issue as important enough to build up."
guatemala.100.a:0 "Baseball Fields."
guatemala.100.b:0 "Houses."

guatemala.101.t:0 "Conflicts in the Unionist Party"
guatemala.101.d:0 "Today, a faction of the Unionist Party led José Azmitia and another led by Lázaro Chacón González have entered into an open conflict due to disagreements over the power of the President in the country. While González defends a more centralized state that gives more power to the president, Azmitia fears that this will just turn González into just another dictator for Guatemala, and their differences have finally spilled over to their followers that have openly clashed. However, both men had a meeting and have made joint public statement claiming they have reconciled their differences in order to keep the country up and running. It is not clear however if they have truly reconciled or they are just banding together out of necessity..."
guatemala.101.a:0 "Let's hope they have truly reconciled."

guatemala.102.t:0 "Furthering of Central American thought"
guatemala.102.d:0 "One of the main objectives of the Unionist party has been since its inception to reinforce the idea of a Central American way of thinking, as well as establishing Guatemala as a key player in the independence of Central America as a whole. While the process to introduce these concepts will be slow, we're starting to see the first signs of improvement in our schools, where now many remember Guatamala as the leader of the Central American independence movement."
guatemala.102.a:0 "The Unionistas are achieving their goals."

guatemala.103.t:0 "Dealing with Arévalo"
guatemala.103.d:0 "With our alliance with the PAR now being broken, we have to deal with the remains of the PPN that kept us together. Juan Jose Arévalo, leader of the PPN and the man who tried to keep the PU and the PAR together against authoritarianism now stands questioned by his actions during such times of crisis. While he has certainly helped us to strengthen our position and take over power, he also provided aid for the PAR, even sometimes taking their side on internal arguments during our coalition days, and he might have flocked to their side if they had taken over instead of us. It is for this that many in our party are distrustful of Arévalo, and demand us to exile him from the country as a traitor. What should we do?"
guatemala.103.a:0 "Exile him, he has no place here."
guatemala.103.b:0 "We all make mistakes, He is still an Ally."

guatemala.104.t:0 "Dr. John Cutler Offers to Experiment on Guatemalan Citizens for Cash."
guatemala.104.d:0 "A call from one Dr. John Cutler came in today requesting a meeting with the president. Seeing no harm a meeting was granted, and what must be one of the most fearful yet interesting propositions to be delivered in Guatemalan history. Dr. Cutler is a senior member of the US Public Health Service, an authority on the prevention of disease. He offers to test the effects of penicillin on preventing syphilis on a select group of Guatemalans. The reason Guatemala was selected, as claimed by Cutler, is because our people live in isolated communities that can be assured to not spread venereal disease very far. While this offer and the payment are attractive, one has to wonder why Cutler is so willing to import medicine at such a great cost."
guatemala.104.a:0 "Get Down With the Sickness."
guatemala.104.b:0 "Outrageous! Get out of here."

guatemala.105.t:0 "Introducing Miss Chiquita"
guatemala.105.d:0 "The banana as foodstuffs is no longer an exotic good to American buyers. This was expected after several decades of business. What isn't expected is competition from the likes of Dole in Hawaii to stir the pot in his favour. We commissioned Dik Browne to design a mascot for our banana division that will recapture the attention of young people. Her name is Miss Chiquita, and her song and dance now adorn radio broadcasts and newspapers across America. Sales are up as well."
guatemala.105.a:0 "Even the Jingle works."

guatemala.106.t:0 "Phantom Assassins Plot Against Ubico!"
guatemala.106.d:0 "A plot to assassinate our beloved Ubico has been found out by our intelligence service today. It detailed an extremely elaborate plan to infiltrate the Casa Crema and poison The President. However, our intelligence service hasn't been able to identify the perpetrators yet, and as the rumours of the conspiracy have conveniently reached the press, we need to choose a scapegoat to blame for the scandal."
guatemala.106.a:0 "The Socialists are behind this."

If we wish to move forward as a nation, we need to focus our efforts in an industrialisation program. Luckily, we can grant some small concessions to the UFC in order to get the capital we need to kickstart the project."
GUA_more_favours:0 "New Development Schemes"
GUA_more_favours_desc:0 "As our industrialisation program starts to bring us profits, we have devised a series of new development schemes that could change the way we construct our industrial parks and infrastructure. Our trade partners in the UFC have informed us that if we grant them a few more concessions, they'd continue to fund the development of Guatemala. Our country is lucky to have such a generous trade partner as the UFC!"
GUA_attract_migrants:0 "Attract Migrants"
GUA_attract_migrants_desc:0 "Guatemala is a small nation, and while we have one of the largest populations of Central America, our industrialisation efforts paired up with our old agrarian initiatives have stretched our work force very thin. We need to start promoting immigration to our country if we wish to continue our ambitious economic plans."
GUA_fix_illiteracy:0 "Greatly Increase Education Budget"
GUA_fix_illiteracy_desc:0 "Despite Orellana's past efforts, illiteracy rates in Guatemala are still cripplingly high. As our country improves, we now lack a professional workforce to operate the many new jobs, and while we can still import professionals from other countries, we have the potential to rely on ourselves if we deal with our illiteracy issues. With this objective in mind, Orellana has decreed a drastic increase in the education budget."
GUA_teachers_are_good:0 "Promote the Teaching Profession"
GUA_teachers_are_good_desc:0 "We won't solve illiteracy by just increasing education spending. We face a severe shortage of teachers and professors in our country, forcing many of current teachers to work overtime at multiple schools. With this in mind, we shall begin a massive increase to their wages in order to promote the teaching profession."
GUA_american_scientists:0 "Import American Know-How"
GUA_american_scientists_desc:0 "Our investments are proving to be successful, and our illiteracy rates are steadily dropping. However, change has been gradual, and we have a rather high demand at the moment for technical know-how. For the time being, we should hire American experts to meet our demand. At least our nation can produce sufficient professionals of its own."
GUA_border_posts:0 "Tighten the Mexican Border"
GUA_border_posts_desc:0 "Mexican support for Central American socialism could prove dangerous if left unchecked. We shall reinforce the border security procedures, and double the border patrols in order to protect our country from the vile Mexican influence. It will also assure us that the Syndicalist rebels don't cross the border towards Mexico in order to get training or rally support for their cause."
GUA_clamp_down:0 "Start Revoking Socialist Reforms"
GUA_clamp_down_desc:0 "Many politicians in the past have introduced socialist reforms that are now hindering our modernisation efforts and disrupt the activities of our trade partners, the UFC. We shall start eroding these reforms little by little until we can remove them completely from our work code, giving us greater freedom to carry out reforms without being hindered by such naïve concepts like 'welfare' or 'job security'."
GUA_more_propaganda:0 "Intensify Anti-Socialist Propaganda"
GUA_more_propaganda_desc:0 "Many citizens, fueled by syndicalist propaganda, have come to doubt our efforts to improve our fair nation. We need to remind our populace who makes our country great and who protects our nation from falling to godless syndicalism, and in order to do so we shall begin a massive propaganda campaign to remind our citizens of our duty to them and our nation."

GUA_death_letter:0 "La Carta de los 311"
GUA_death_letter_desc:0 "'(...)Guatemala cannot escape the democratic imperatives of our time. It is impossible to frustrate with coercive measures the irrepressible impulses of the generous ideology that is reaffirming itself in the universal conscience through the bloodiest of the struggles between oppression and freedom in America.'"
GUA_orellana_holds_on:0 "The Orellanan Government Lives On"
GUA_orellana_holds_on_desc:0 "Despite all odds, the Orellanan government has survived the popular outrage of the letter of the 311, and has managed to restore control over the nation. Larga Vida al Eterno Presidente!"
GUA_purge_dissidents:0 "Finish Taking out the Traitors"
GUA_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Despite having severely weakened them with our victory during the revolt, we cannot underestimate the influence our enemies hold on the nation. If we want to secure a prosperous future for Guatemala, we will need to finish hunting them down through mountains, forests and cities. Only then our nation will know peace!"
GUA_clamp_down_more:0 "Expand the Martial Law"
GUA_clamp_down_more_desc:0 "Martial law at the beginning enacted merely a curfew and the usage of military force if needed to subdue any dissidence. However, as the uprising proved, this martial law wasn't as effective as we thought, and we will have to invest into strengthening the executive power of said martial law in order to guarantee a fast reaction against dissidents."
GUA_unlimited_presidency:0 "Orellana, El Presidente Eterno"
GUA_unlimited_presidency_desc:0 "President Orellana is slowly becoming a symbol of resilience in our nation. Despite all odds, he has managed to remain as president of our nation, and he will surely lead for many years to come. No longer shall we be tied to pesky politicians that banish after their term is over. Orellana is eternal. Viva el Presidente!"
GUA_promote_economy:0 "Realise Our True Potential"
GUA_promote_economy_desc:0 "With the defeat of the rebels, there's no one to oppose our reforms to take Guatemala to new heights. Now we need to begin an ambitious new set of public works in order to boost Guatemala's industry and infrastructure. This way we can reduce less on our agriculture, and more on our industrial output."
GUA_promote_more_education:0 "Education is the Basis of Success"
GUA_promote_more_education_desc:0 "One of the main objectives of the Orellana government is to improve the overall education in the nation and reduce the illiteracy rates. Now, with a strengthened government, Orellana has announced a new funding frenzy for University projects, schools and an increase on teacher's wages. This will surely bring us up to speed with the rest of the world!"
GUA_stop_pestering_me:0 "Stability and Prosperity"
GUA_stop_pestering_me_desc:0 "The two main axis of the new Orellanan government will be 'Estabilidad y Prosperidad'. The first one, stability, ensured by the recent victory over the dissidents, and the other, prosperity, shall be brought about by Orellana's careful investments program, along with our industrialisation efforts."
GUA_on_the_right_path:0 "A Brighter Tomorrow"
GUA_on_the_right_path_desc:0 "With our reforms passed and our position consolidated, Guatemala's future shines bright as Orellana lights the way for our nation. We can only wish now that he stays forever at the helm."

GUA_more_UFC:0 "Renew the Good Relations with the UFC"
GUA_more_UFC_desc:0 "After some ups and downs between the Orellana government and the UFC, Ubico has set out to renew the good relations the UFC had during the Cabrera regime. For this, we shall contact the company and inform them that we're open for business once again and like never before!"
GUA_execute_dissidents:0 "Eradicate the Opposition"
GUA_execute_dissidents_desc:0 "Despite the crushing defeat dealt to the rebels, our country is still filled with fliers and pamphlets denouncing our regime as tyrannical. We need to hunt down these remaining protestors and dissidents and bring them to justice."
GUA_no_syndies_escape:0 "Intensify Patrols on the Mexican Border"
GUA_no_syndies_escape_desc:0 "Mexico has become a hotspot for revolutionary thought, and as such it threatens the stability of our nation, allowing rebels to cross the border, rearming and resting and the coming back to continue their insurgency. We shall intensify the border patrols, so no one may come in nor out of Guatemala without our forces having a say in the matter!"
GUA_better_constitution:0 "A New Constitution for our Great Leader"
GUA_better_constitution_desc:0 "Ubico, being a charismatic leader, has proposed a constitutional reform in order to be able to secure Guatemalan stability for the near future. Provided that he has tried pushing for several reforms and the constitution is either slowing down or outright forbidding his actions, it is in our best interest to start a constitutional reform."
GUA_napoleonic_ambitions:0 "Cult of Personality"
GUA_napoleonic_ambitions_desc:0 "Ubico is a hero for Guatemala, and everyone in the nation will know this fact! From Belize to Ocos, and from San Mateo Ixtatán to Esquipulas, all the citizens of Guatemala shall learn to appreciate our glorious leader!"
GUA_napoleonic_state:0 "Napoleonic Military State"
GUA_napoleonic_state_desc:0 "Ubico, a faithful admirer of Napoleon's exploits, has set out to transform Guatemala into what his idol had envisioned for France back in the early 19th century, or at least, as close as he can do so in a nation as Guatemala."
GUA_one_man_state:0 "Onward, Together, For Ubico"
GUA_one_man_state_desc:0 "With Ubico's position strengthened, the state tuned to follow his command and the populace accepting him as the savior of Guatemala, we can all now look outwards with pride. As long as Ubico handles the helm of Guatemala, our country shall be destined to greatness!"

GUA_socdem_wins:0 "The National Progress Party Wins!"
GUA_socdem_wins_desc:0 "With the uprising being successful, democracy finally has been restored to our nation! However, we still have a long way to go before we can actually recover from decades of authoritarianism."
GUA_education_investment:0 "Policy on Education"
GUA_education_investment_desc:0 "As the dust settles, we need to review the government policies on education. While Orellana had done a great work reducing illiteracy, Guatemala still has a long way to go before becoming a forward thinking and 'educated' nation."
GUA_scavenge_UFC:0 "Dealing with the UFC"
GUA_scavenge_UFC_desc:0 "The United Fruit Company, the bane of Guatemala for decades now, is finally at our mercy. It now falls to us to decide what shall be our stance with them. While they can still be beneficial to Guatemala's improvement, they have also hindered Guatemalan democracy in the past, and we need to weight our options carefully..."
GUA_complete_nationalisation:0 "Start the Socialist Transformation"
GUA_complete_nationalisation_desc:0 "With the end of our alliance with the democrats and our victory over their faction, we can now start to turn Guatemala into a proper socialist society. We shall first consolidate our position and start passing a series of reforms to ease our way into a socialist society."
GUA_empower_workers:0 "Empower the Workers"
GUA_empower_workers_desc:0 "One of our main pools of support are the industrial workers of our country, which is a group that has greatly expanded in these last few decades with the limited industrialisation efforts that have occurred. We shall reward their loyalty by expanding their rights and improving their wages."
GUA_execute_bourgeousie:0 "Execute the Bourgeoisie"
GUA_execute_bourgeousie_desc:0 "The bane of our nation has been the wealthy capitalists that have grown rich at the expense of the common Guatemalan workers and peasants. We shall have no mercy with such scoundrels!"
GUA_nationalise:0 "Finish Nationalisation"
GUA_nationalise_desc:0 "In order to truly finish our reforms, we need to finally nationalize the key industries that keep our nation going. This will finally defang our enemies in the UFC and get precious assets into the government hands to distribute amongst the Guatemalan workers."

GUA_centroamerica_desc:0 "With our reforms finalized, our industry at our disposal and the workers rallying at our cause, we can start pushing for the reunification of Central America under the socialist banner!"
GUA_broke_socialists:0 "Cleanse Guatemala of the PAR"
GUA_broke_socialists_desc:0 "The PAR has proven to be a liability for democracy, and if our young democracy hopes to survive, we need to cleanse their influence from our country before they manage to gather enough support to overthrow us."
GUA_return_to_normalcy:0 "Teach Guatemalans Democracy"
GUA_return_to_normalcy_desc:0 "The concept of democracy seems to have been lost in Guatemala as a whole, with the common folk confusing the authoritarian regimes we used to have as 'democratic'. We need to instill the democratic ideals back into them, and in order to do so, we'll push for new education curriculum and start a propaganda campaign to show that their voices are now heard."
GUA_restore_constitution:0 "Revive the Constitution"
GUA_restore_constitution_desc:0 "With the authoritarian regimes and the recent crisis, it is clear that our constitution has become into hardly more than a token document that gets discarded whenever it doesn't suit the ruling party.

GUA_demo_unionism:0 "Push for a Free Union"
GUA_demo_unionism_desc:0 "As Guatemala is slowly but surely rejecting the idea of totalitarianism, our party should strive to reunite with our brethren, to face the future together."


GUA_abandon_monroe_thought:0 "Stop Relying on the Monroe Doctrine"
GUA_abandon_monroe_thought_desc:0 "The infamous Monroe Doctrine, in effect since 1823, has made us rely too much in our northern neighbour for our self defence, and now that they are not in any position to help us, we will have to kickstart our forces from scratch if we hope to survive the storm that approaches Central America."
GUA_superior_firepower_1:0 "Our Men are Precious"
GUA_superior_firepower_1_desc:0 "Guatemala is one of the nations with the highest populations in Central America.

GUA_artillery_bonus:0 "Bombardearlos desde Lejos"
GUA_artillery_bonus_desc:0 "Artillery has proven its usefulness during the Weltkrieg, and its utility in modern war cannot be underestimated.

GUA_support_companies:0 "Increase Division Capabilities"
GUA_support_companies_desc:0 "Our divisions are currently mostly suited to peacekeeping tasks and anti-insurgency combat, it's not really prepared to deal with modern warfare and that will prove problematic if a conflict arises in Central America where we are drawn into.

GUA_motorised:0 "Mechanise Our Troops"
GUA_motorised_desc:0 "Mechanisation may seem like a strange thing for a Central American nation, but there's no doubt that it'll be the future of warfare.

GUA_firepower_doctrine:0 "Perfect Our Methods"
GUA_firepower_doctrine_desc:0 "Warfare is both a science and an art. While we may have some proud and capable officers in our ranks, the truth is that unless we tune our industry to suit their needs, they won't be able to guarantee our victory.

GUA_mass_assault_1_desc:0 "With Guatemala's numerical advantage, we can focus on creating a larger army which can take advantage of its numbers to swarm our enemies.

GUA_more_guns:0 "Streamline Gun Production"
GUA_more_guns_desc:0 "Guatemala's population may be high, but unless we arm each private with a rifle, it will hardly matter when facing off other professional armies, like the Salvadorian one. We will need to streamline our rifle production in order to provide sufficient rifles for our troops."

GUA_more_mils:0 "Use the Military as Workforce"
GUA_more_mils_desc:0 "The military doesn't need to be necessarily a simple combat force. It should be put to work to build industries and infrastructure and repair them when damaged.

GUA_aircraft_research:0 "Better Aerial Support"

GUA_more_fighters:0 "Swarm the Skies"
GUA_more_fighters_desc:0 "Our only real rivals in the air in Central America are the pesky Salvadorians, which already have a prominent air force in their nation.

GUA_master_skies:0 "Master Air Warfare"
GUA_master_skies_desc:0 "In order to master the art of air warfare, we cannot rely on old officers and ancient officer schools.

GUA_computers_are_cool:0 "Guatemalan Universities"
GUA_computers_are_cool_desc:0 "We cannot expect our nation to evolve if our brightest minds routinely leave overseas for their education, and in many cases do not return.

GUA_MilInd:0 "A Bigger Military Budget"
GUA_MilInd_desc:0 "Improving our country is pointless if we do not have the means to defend it. While our generals and soldiers may have the hearts needed for the task, we need to make sure their equipment is up to the mark as well. This increase in money will also keep them compliant."

GUA_diversify_bananas:0 "Diversify Banana Species"
GUA_diversify_bananas_desc:0 "Growing bananas is all well and good, but we cannot risk a downturn in our harvest by growing one single type of banana. In order to cover more niches of the banana market, we must get more cultivars and grow more banana assortments."
GUA_invest_banana_profits:0 "Use Cash Crop Profits"
GUA_invest_banana_profits_desc:0 "The cash crops aren't called like this for no reason; we are earning plenty of money from their export. But we cannot just sit on it; it must be invested so that we can produce more and sell even more in the future."
GUA_ports:0 "Expand Our Ports"

GUA_dockyard:0 "Found A New Dockyard"
GUA_dockyard_desc:0 "It seems like we need an entirely new dockyard if we are to properly develop a navy. No problem; it is something that the proud Guatemalan people can manage; our construction industry needs the exercise anyway."
GUA_nav_research:0 "The Ships of Tomorrow"
GUA_nav_research_desc:0 "We may not be able to match our enemies' naval power in raw numbers, but we can focus on innovation instead. Our navy will field only state-of-the-art ships, and the rest of Central America will tremble!"

GUA_final_cleansing:0 "Cleanse Guatemala of All Socialists"
GUA_final_cleansing_desc:0 "The Revolution may be squashed, but the revolutionaries and their sympathizers remain.

GUA_a_clean_guatemala:0 "Una Nación Renacida"

In 1897 he graduated from the Military academy at Alta Verapaz as a second lieutenant, and his sheer talent and intelligence managed to turn him into a Brigadier General by 1906 after taking part in the War of Totoposte. In 1923 he became War Secretary, and with Orellana's coup, he became chief of the secret police and Vice President.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He has expressed profound disagreements with Orellana, and despite being Orellana's VP, Ubico stands to be one of Orellana's main rivals in the political scene."

The opening of scholarships for the Escuela Politécnica, a military academy in San Juan Sacatepéquez, convinced him to join the institution in 1932 as the only way to sustain his family. He has since then become an exceptional student, reaching the rank of First Sergeant of the Company of Knight-Cadets, a post that has only been achieved by 4 other students in the last 12 years. His talent gained him the respect of the staff of the academy, including the American headmaster, John Considine. Árbenz graduated in 1935, and he has since then served as a teacher in the academy while having the respect of most of the army staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Staunch Defender of Democracy."
