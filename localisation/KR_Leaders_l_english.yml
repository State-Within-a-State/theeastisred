## Afghanistan ##
POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Who but Babur has ever brought greater change and prestige to Afghanistan than Amanullah Khan? Ascended to the throne amidst the Weltkrieg, Amanullah immediately attacked the British Empire and won handsome concessions. He capitalized on this victory and subsequent further gains following the collapse of the British Empire to implement sweeping social reforms. Though Amanullah's rule remains absolute, he dreams of bringing true constitutional governance to Afghanistan and overcoming the nation's deep ethnic and tribal divisions. Time will tell if this great reformer's vision shall come to be."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "An ethnic Tajik, Kalakani was a longtime officer in the Afghan Royal Army who deserted a bit before chaos of the collapse of the British Empire. Using that chaos and the regular army's pre-occupation, Kalakani turned to a life of crime. Once the army managed to restore a modicum of order however, Kalakani fled and sought the protection of his Tajik co-ethnics.\nOutspokenly opposed to the reforms and modernisation campaigns of Amamnullah Khan, Kalakani came to head a rural ultra-conservative movement bearing his name. Rather shockingly, his movement successfully overthrew Amanullah and Kalakani has won the Afghan crown."

POLITICS_WILLIAM_WIED_DESC:0 "A German army officer and midling noble, just before the start of the Weltkrieg, Wilhelm was crowned Prince of the newly independent Albania. However, the Weltkrieg would quickly see Wilhelm all but deposed as Albania became a battleground. Eventually restored to the throne, Wilhelm was then quickly overthrown and an Albanian republic declared.\nOnce again restored to the Albanian throne, Wilhelm now juggles competing interests and personal loyalties at home and abroad. Perhaps in time with the assistance of his foreign benefactors, the Albanian people will come to fully accept this German protestant as their Prince."
POLITICS_ENVER_HOXHA_DESC:0 "A Bektashi from Gjirokastër, Hoxha studied in the Commune France and became affiliated with the Jacobin faction there. Upon returning to Albania, the young Hoxha joined his idol, Ali Kemendi's, revolutionary movement, but eventually became disillusioned with the movement and the man himself. Calling upon his contacts in the Commune of France, Hoxha then founded a small 'vanguardist' organisation, and thanks to foreign intervention, he and his group now stand astride all of Albania."

He has attempted to to de-militarize the left-nationalist movement, renaming the Unity Party and forging ties with the nation's new middle class."
## American Union State ##
POLITICS_GEORGE_VAN_HORN_MOSELEY:0 "Fourty years of service for the United States Army from a cavalry lieutenant in the Philippines to a Commissioned Officer in Washington has created a strong portfolio for Moseley. Experiences serving alongside generals like George Patton and General MacArthur influenced his eventual decision to support Huey Long and his adamant belief in Jewish conspiracy. Ultimately his belief in the dangers of any form of socialism made him the perfect spokesman of the War Powers Committee. Without Moseley would be impossible for the War Powers Committee to succeed Huey Long in the disappearance that Moseley was complicit in, so say the rumors."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_DUDLEY_PELLEY:0 "At age thirty-nine William Pelley was a rather unimaginative Hollywood screenwriter and journalist. His past adventures mostly consisting of visiting Russia and absorbing anti-Semitic pamphlets. By the time of his founding the Silver Legion in 1933, Pelley had cultivated his unique ideology, combining spiritualism, democracy, and faith. With Pelley's more eccentric views being reserved for trusted allies only. After his organisation was allowed to participate in elections by Huey Long, he went on to win the elections with his “Christian Party”. Anti-socialism and a belief in Christian Identity and Expanded Democracy are the ideals that forms the backbone of his government."
POLITICS_GERALD_L_K_SMITH:0 "For decades thought to be a follower more than a leader, Gerald Smith has come onto his own after joining the Huey Long’s American Union State in 1937 while on the evangelical circuit. An ordained Minister in his early life, Smith first came under the influence of Huey Long's Share Our Wealth society. Smith however migrated to the far-right portion of the AFP. Smith had continued to serve under Long, and despite their numerous disputes, he has managed to secure his position as Huey Long’s Successor. Now that he is in charge, there is little doubt that the AFP will migrate further right."
POLITICS_PAPPY_O_DANIEL_DESC:0 "Wilbert Lee O'Daniel has had a fascinating journey. Beginning his adult life as a flour salesman, he also branched out into music and radio, eventually taking over his company's radio advertising effort and making it into his own project. It was in this radio show that the "pass the biscuits, Pappy" phrase was first used, and it was also where O'Daniel would become a household name. During the recent turmoil in Texas and the rest of the country, O'Daniel decided to throw his lot in with Huey Long and the America First Party, believing them to be better representatives of the common people than the federal government, despite many disagreements on policy grounds. Now, having begun his own political adventure as the leader of the Democrats in Texas and the Union State as a whole, he hopes to lead America through the current crisis with nothing but old-fashioned Texas values and his Christian faith to guide him."

POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_LONG:0 "Once denied the Lieutenant Governor's post by his brother Huey Long in 1932, Earl Long has long lived in his brother's shadow. Earl was known in Congress for his progressive policies, but also for supporting the AFP's authority over state government. As the pre-determined successor to Huey Long years before his death, Earl displays the same reformist agenda, but with a more socially conservative and indulgent touch. It is under Earl Long that Huey Long's eduction and welfare reforms were really put into practice during those tense years. Whispers of Earl's racist remarks and of mental instability are covered up by the AFP."
##Constitutional American Republic##
POLITICS_WILLIAM_JOSEPH_SIMMONS:0 "Once, the Ku Klux Klan was as good as dead. Nothing but a fraternal organization from long ago. However, things change. The film “The Birth of a Nation” injected new lifeblood into the KKK, painting them as a heroic force protecting the white race. The KKK was to be reborn, and Simmons was to head this revived Klan. As America deteriorated, the Klan sided with Murray and the Constitutional American Republic and grew as a significant internal faction. Now, with Murray gone the Klan and the National Democratic White League has taken power, and  Simmons will shape America in his radical vision. "
POLITICS_WILLIAM_H_MURRAY_DESC:0 "William Henry Davis Murray, better known as “Alfalfa Bill” has quite the life under his belt. Born on a farm in Texas, little would expect that Murray would end up where he is today, his life being unremarkable for the first years of his life. His first introduction into politics was as a campaigner and in a failed run for Senate. However, Murray took to politics, being a skilled orator and lawyer. Through alliances, he rose through the political ranks until he was elected Governor of Oklahoma. This sent him to the forefront of national politics and pitted him against Garner and the “Moderate” Democrats. Eventually, Murray split from the traditional Democrats and founded the “Old Democrat Party”, which gained support from the Far-Right all across America. Now, President Murray must fight for his allies, for America, and for the White Race. "
POLITICS_HERBERT_W_ARMSTRONG_DESC:0 "Herbert W. Armstrong, the Apostle of Christ. The black sheep of the NWDL leadership, little would have predicted that he would have been the one to succeed Simmons as leader of America; yet here he is. His early life was influenced by the church, his lengthy study of the bible beginning after a challenge from his wife to find proof that Sunday was the Sabbath. As his fanaticism grew, god himself began to influence him, opening his mind to new truths not accepted by the masses. Soon enough he began his own church and began broadcasting his sermons on the radio, something that garnered him a large following.  As America collapsed, Armstrong Denounced Reed and Long as the Beast and False Prophet and declared his allegiance to the Constitutional American Republic. And with a power struggle that ensured after the death of the American Emperor, Armstrong took the reigns of America. Under his watch, America will truly be God’s land."
POLITICS_FRANCIS_PARKER_YOCKEY_DESC:0 "Francis Parker Yockey, an up-and-coming member of the Young Klan, has led a coup against Herbert W. Armstrong. Yockey, though young, has taken inspiration from various spiritual and political figures in Europe who call for the erasure of the Enlightenment and Liberal values that characterized the previous century. Instead, Yockey hopes to establish a new age of authoritarian rule in America, which he views as the bastion of old values. To help him achieve this goal, he hopes to eliminate the power of the worst "Culture Distorting" and "Cultural Parasite" groups, namely racial and religious minorities in the country. Concurrent with this goal is the wider aim of unifying the Western world into an Imperium of Europe, which Yockey believes is the only way to save his people from certain destruction. To save the West, Yockey will become the ultimate authority over a united European and American civilization, and through the success of this task, we will finally have peace. Though this will be no easy task, Yockey's pragmatism and willingness to work with unlikely allies makes what seems to be an impossible goal into an ambitious but desparate attempt to save the world."
POLITICS_GEORGE_LINCOLN_ROCKWELL_DESC:0 "George Lincoln Rockwell, the young but idealistic leader of the Young Klan, has successfully wrested control of the country from Herbert W. Armstrong. Rockwell, unable to tolerate Armstrong's policies, has his own plans for the country at large. He hopes to reorganize society under what he believes to be the laws of nature, or the tribe. Further, he believes himself to be the true embodiment of the values of the Founding Fathers, and he fully intends to carry out their will in establishing an authoritarian state to maintain order and cleanse the country of its old corruption. An avid nationalist, Rockwell intends to separate minority groups who do not fit within the colonial definition of an American. Through these means, America will be a country for its own citizens once more, and the invasion of outside groups will be turned back. To accomplish these goals, Rockwell plans to use a robust media and propaganda apparatus that takes advantage of his own charisma as well as the passion of his followers to demonstrate the necessity of their actions. It will not be an easy road to free America from its shackles, but Rockwell believes he has just what he needs to rouse the American people from their slumber and call them to final action against those who would see them destroyed."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSEL_DESC:0 "Born in Winder, Georgia on November 2nd, 1897 to a wealthy family, Richard Russell Jr. is fairly young. Russell began his career as a Democrat, and has stayed true to that party even through the rise of the Old Democratic Party under Alfalfa Bill Murray. However, his meteoric rise in Georgia politics has meant that he is at the center of the new Constitutional American Republic. Beginning as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives and then making his way to the position of governor, he became the most powerful man in the state. However, he only served as governor for two years, vacating his post to run for the U.S. Senate instead. He was succeeded as governor by Eugene Talmadge, a fiery orator whose Old Democratic leanings have put him at odds with Russell. Indeed, the two man have develeoped a bitter rivalry over the past few years, the culmination of which occurred in the 1936 election, in which Talmadge challenged Russell for his senate seat. Talmadge, articulating a powerful racial message, lost to the more economically focused Russell, but their rivalry is stronger than ever. Regardless, because the capital of the Constitutional American Republic is in Atlanta, Richard Russell has had considerable influence over the Constitutional American Republic, despite his status as a Democrat. His beliefs are more in line with Murray than the beliefs of Talmadge or many other Old Democrats, and the two have recently developed a sort of friendship. Russell wholeheartedly agrees with Murray's slogan of fighting "Corporations, Communism, and Miscegenation", despite his aristocratic background. In fact, Russell has always been a populist in both rhetoric and policy, always legislating for the sake of his people, not the wealthy. Now that he leads the nation, he must outthink the enemies who surround him at every turn while also finding a way to save his country. Clever politican and genuine populist that he is, he is perhaps the one man who can achieve these goals." 
POLITICS_EUGENE_TALMADGE_DESC:0 "Eugene Talmadge was born on Sep 23th 1884 in Forsyth, Georgia. Going to the University of Georgia’s law school and being a part of groups such as the Sigma Nu fraternity, Talmadge began his pursuit for a political career. Running multiple times for Georgia's state legislature and losing, Talmadge became a democratic commissioner for the state’s agriculture. Despite these seeming failures, Talmadge made full use of spreading his rhetoric and influence among Georgia’s rural population. Utilizing his popularity, he eventually won the candidacy for Georgia’s governorship. Only joining the Old Democratic Party in ‘36, he made sure to sweep Georgia up in a tide of rhetoric once the civil war began, starting a wave of southern pride not seen since the civil war. While within the politics of the Old Democrats, Talmadge was not trusted with his late entrance to the party, and with the establishment seeing him as an extremist with his support for even further segregation and racial laws. Despite this seeming uphill battle, Talmadge seemed to convince Murray with his rhetoric as Murray assigned him as his successor. Now in charge of the nation, Talmadge has full reins to change the country as he sees fit."
COR_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "James Strom Thurmond was born on Dec 05, 1902 in Edgefield,South Carolina. Thurmond has served a variety of jobs, From farmer to teacher and coach, before becoming a Judge for his hometown. Forming populist rhetoric at seeing the poor conditions these career’s were going through during the depression, Thurmond eventually rose to the South Carolina Senate. Serving as a staunch segregationist yet still firm populist, Thurmond was among the Old Democrats throughout his young politician years. Throughout the Civil War Thurmond remained with the ODP,  constantly gaining support for the war effort with his charismatic fervor and gaining the eye of Murray for his support of the cause. Although they were somewhat split ideologically with Strom’s support for welfare, Murray propelled him forth in a surprise move when he designated him his successor. Now in charge of the Nation, Strom Thurmond must fight for his promises of welfare for the common man in an establishment that is still uncertain of the Young populist leader."
POLITICS_JOHN_RANKIN_DESC:0 "John E Rankin was born on March 29th, 1882 in Itawamba county, Mississippi. Going to Law school in Mississippi, Rankin eventually got elected to congress as a Democrat from it’s first district. Serving multiple terms in congress, it wasn’t until the eventual instability of the Great Depression that Rankin, Murray and other southern Democrats formed the Old Democratic Party. Serving as a part of the establishing ODP members, Rankin eventually got selected as Murray’s Vice president in the 1936 elections. Continuing to be Murray’s right hand man, he served faithfully, as his uncharismatic yet loyal nature proved him to be a good workhouse in the politics of the Constitutional American Republic. Now with Murray out of the picture, Rankin is the head of the government as his successor. How he will run the nation is yet to be seen, as so far it seems he will stick to the establishment and Murray’s previous ideals." 
POLITICS_GEORGE_PATTON_DESC:0 "George Smith Patton, popularly called "Old Blood and Guts", was once a rising star in the U.S. Army, but his fortunes changed rather quickly. Now, Patton heads the army of the Constitutional American Republic, fighting to save the country from syndicalists, populists, and any other traitors who decide to show their ugly faces. Officially a member of the ODP, Patton has never liked politics much, but most of "Alfalfa" Bill Murray's views were in line with his own, and the two developed a friendship. From the beginning, Murray was quick to recognize Patton's talent, and he made him one of his top advisors. Now that Patton leads the party, he plans to leave most of the day-to-day administration work to his vice president and cabinet, opting instead to try and place the country on the road to recovery through guts, discipline, and hard work. This road is sure to be a hard one, as Patton believes this battle, like any other, will be lost as soon as the initiative is gone. As such, the American people will be pushed hard, but Patton aims to set an example by working hard himself, barnstorming the country with inspirational speeches designed to restore morale. Although he is an outspoken racist and a conservative through and through, Patton is different from his fellow politicians in that his focus is on America, not the South, and he has no love for the proposals of the Ku Klux Klan or the Fordists. He is instead expected to take a more moderate approach to politics, more in line with Murray. His foremost concern is to keep the old America alive, an America there was no such thing as a coward, and he plans to pursue this goal with much enthusiasm."
POLITICS_CHARLES_LINDBERGH:0 "Charles Lindbergh, or Lindy, was once the most famous pilot in America. Lindbergh's fame grew well into the 1920s in service of the US Air Mail Service. This coupled with a knack for improving planes that eventually grew into a business made Lindbergh even more famous. Lindbergh's association with the AFP starting in 1932, and escalated until he made contact with the War Power Committee. Eventually picked out of the Committee to be their next leader, Lindbergh intends to continue Murray's racialist positions and to encourage industrial innovations through example."
POLITICS_DC_STEPHENSON_DESC:0 "Nobody in their right mind would predict that David Curtiss Stephenson would ever lead America. His attempts with politics all failing miserably. But even though politics failed for him, Stephenson would still achieve power through the revived Ku Klux Klan, joining and rapidly rising through the ranks of the Indiana Klan. Eventually he would become Grand Dragon of Indiana, and command terrifying amounts of power in the Midwestern United States. As the Klan grew in power nationwide, so did the list of Stephenson’s enemies. Stephenson was the victim of numerous assassination attempts. These assassination attempts, along with Wilson’s softer hand on the Klan lead to Stephenson avoiding meaningful consequences for his actions. As America collapsed, the Klan and the NWDL sided with the CAR, and with the death of William J. Simmons, Stephenson is the man now poised to lead America into the future. "
POLITICS_HIRAM_WESLEY_EVANS_DESC:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans is a man who cares little for anything but power. The first parts of his life were relatively unremarkable, growing up as a normal child in Alabama and eventually moving to Texas where he became a dentist. However, Evans had massive ambitions and speaking skills to match, and with his admission into the Ku Klux Klan his path to power was becoming apparent. Even though he was not opposed to Lynching’s and even took place in them, he became vehemently opposed to them as he feared that they would give the Klan a bad image. Through the years, Evans grew to be in the highest echelons of Klan leadership, eventually becoming poised to take over upon the death of William J. Simmons. Now in charge, he promised reforms without selling out to Liberals or Socialists. Though, many comment that he cares little for ideology, only money and power. "

POLITICS_CARLES_DESC:0 "Manuel Carles began his political career when joined the Union Civica Radical 1898, which had been gaining popularity as it had recently been formed, back in 1891. He then climbed through the ranks of the party until he managed to become a national deputy for the province of Santa Fe in the national congress. He was assigned in 1918 by his colleague, president Hipólito Yrigoyen, as 'Interventor' of the Salta province, starting a long record of interventions by said government. His methods granted him enough experience to be allowed to become a teacher in the 'Colegio Militar de la Nacion' and the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra'.\n\nWith the unoficial formation of the 'Liga Patriotica' during the 'Semana Tragica', Carles began making contact with the organisation, which was officially born in 1920 with Carlés as its leader. The organisation then began promoting the persecution of jews, anarchists, socialists and foreigners that refuse to integrate to the local Argentinean culture, and with the growing unrest, he began scheming his takeover, backed by many within the navy and a few army officers. With his coup d'etat now being successful, he now sits in the 'Casa Rosada' in Buenos Aires, but his regime has not yet been recognized by the other provinces.

Despite becoming a national fencing champion, which turned him into a celebrity for the oligarchy, he's hardly had any relevant political position in his life, but the FOP's secession from Argentina has caused him great concern. After a short trip to Europe, he has changed his point of view regarding politics, and has returned to Argentina motivated by a will to help the working men of the country and take the nation to new heights.

Her father, Armand Mureau, was a member of the French Paris Commune during the 1871 uprising and Her family was forced to move to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was professor of moral and civic instruction in her school, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen beggining to inspire the young woman towards political activism. In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, joining the Socialist Party and later entering the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later.\n\nHowever, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with the more radicalized Baldomeristas in the PS. As the Red Scare ran through the nation, she was forced to go underground until very recently. Always valuing democracy and pacifism, now Mureau has managed to become Head of State, where she is bound to try to take the country towards her vision of a new, equal and peaceful Argentina."

POLITICS_JOSE_TAMBORINI_DESC:0 "Jose Pascual Tamborini joined the 'Union Civica Radical' when he was still in highschool. He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to successfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\nTamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N.

Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and financial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\nIn 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party.

He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow."
POLITICS_HIPOLITO_YRIGOYEN_DESC:0 "When Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen finished high school, he began his political career when he assisted Alem in the creation of the Union Civica, and when it subsequently split during the Roca regime, he continued assisting his uncle with the Union Civica Radical. He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\nHe then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\nHis increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."
POLITICS_JOSE_PETER_DESC:0 "Jose Peter, like many other 'Gauchos' from rural areas, was forced to move to the big cities in search of work, more specifically to the city of Zarate in 1923. His first political experience was in 1927, when he signed up with the 'Sindicato de Frigorificos de Zarate', where he helped create the 'Federación Obreros de la Industria de la Carne' with other trade unions of Zarate and Berisso.\n\nWhen Uriburu came to power, he was sent to the Ushuaia penitentiary after organizing a successful strike where he demanded the company 'River Plate de Zarate' to pay their worker's wages which had been delayed for two months. Now that he's free and in control of Argentina, he'll make sure to provide justice for the workers from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie."
POLITICS_ANGEL_BORLENGHI_DESC:0 "Angel Borlenghi became involved in politics with the local socialists of Pompeya's neighbourhood at a very young age, joining the 'Gremio de Empleados de Comercio'('Trade Employees Syndicate') and the Socialist Party as soon as he came of age. Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\nAfter Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."
POLITICS_ARTURO_FRONDIZI_DESC:0 "Arturo Frondizi was a strong supporter of the UCR and a defender of democracy when Yrigoyen managed to win the presidency, but refused to participate in any sort of political activity. However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\nHe was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\nHe has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."
POLITICS_RICARDO_BALBIN_DESC:0 "In 1922, when he became 18, Ricardo Balbín joined the UCR and moves to La Plata, where local political activism drove him to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, but hardly ever using his title as he has since then fully committed to his political career.\n\nHe was chosen as provincial deputy in 1932 and 1940, however, he resigned his last post in condemnation to the fraud that plagued local elections.

When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\nDespite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."

POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Born to an Irish migrant family, Edelmiro Julian Farrel enrolled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has become a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Peron, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."
POLITICS_MARCELO_ALVEAR_DESC:0 "Alvear became involved in politics at a young age, helping organize a meeting in Jardin Florida which would lead to the 'Revolución del Parque', after which he became secretary for Leandro N. Alem. He continued serving Alem until his suicide, after which he left to France for a time and got married. He was elected deputy between 1912 and 1916 without even residing in the country, forcing him to return to Argentina during the Sáenz Peña regime, after which he became Argentinian ambassador to France, even donating a large amount of wealth for the construction of front line hospitals.\n\nHe was elected as president from 1922 to 1928, where he tried to reduce the FOP's influence in Argentina at large by granting better rights for workers in the country, although he had kept a hardline stance towards the FOP, mostly due to militaristic influences in his staff. Like his predecessor, Yrigoyen, he tried to intervene provinces that had their elections rigged by wealthy local elites, but his methods polarized the UCR and the UCRA even more. Nevertheless, his progressive social, educational and economic reforms have left a positive impression in the Argentinian people, and now that he's been re-elected as president, he'll try to re-enact and continue the reforms for which he stood for in his first presidency."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_DE_ANDREA_DESC:0 "Miguel de Andrea began his career after being ordained in 1899 by the Bishop of La Plata, Juan Terrero. He climbed steadily the ranks of the church until becoming the Head Priest of the San Miguel de Arcangel Church, and being named director of a Social-Christian Trade Union, the Circulos Obreros Catolicos, after the death of its founder, Federico Grote. However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself aligning with the Liga Patriotica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinian branch of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, his views never aligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally skeptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriotica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists. Without any solid military or civilian leaders willing to obey Brazilian commands, Miguel was chosen as the provisional President of Argentina until a more stable government can be settled in favour of the Integralist doctrine, which Miguel believes will finally bring faith in God, the Church and the government back to the workers."

POLITICS_ARTUR_NEIVA_BAH_DESC:0 "Artur Neiva is an extremely renowned and respected scientist, whose forays into politics are fairly recent, being appointed to administrative positions in the Bahian government of the early 1930s in the wake of the interstate war. While his experience in political matters is mostly practical in terms of bureaucracy, he is known worldwide for his studies and scientific expeditions in the US, Argentina and the hinterlands of Bahia and other brazilian states, which helps with the international standing of the newly founded republic, seeking to improve its situation through proven science rather than poorly planned idealism. He shares many political beliefs with Monteiro Lobato, and while some call out the eagerness of the pair to work with foreign powers, they believe they do what must be done for the advancement and development of their new nations."
POLITICS_A_BAH_DESC:0 "Luís Viana Filho hails from Salvador da Bahia, but was actually born in Paris. Having, like most politicians in his state, graduated in law school, he shifted his career towards journalism, working for multiple important newspapers in the area. Elected a representative in the 1930s, his career has steadily increased his clout, and he managed to place himself in a position to present himself as the leader of a stable, independent Bahia to the occupiers who then held Salvador. A man believing in aggressive and decisive action in politics, Luis plans to push an intense industrialization program in the newly independent republic."
POLITICS_LOMATO_BAH_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_VITAL_BAH_DESC:0 "Born before the time of the republic in 1874, Vital Soares is a well known liberal lawyer and politician hailing from the state of Bahia, just one of many prominent figures that followed the power vacuum that local oligarch JJ Seabra left in the state political landscape. While previously a staunch ally of Julio Prestes and one of the main figures of the Liberal Party, Vital joined the splinter Liberal Republican movement following frustration with the compromises made with the party's ideals, but his career certainly has taken an expected turn, as he is now at the helm of the first independent Bahian state in history. While his principles will certainly not waver easily, his position at the helm of what essentially is a puppet state is not an enviable one, especially since the new independence has not erased the old rivalries that have torn Bahia for decades."
POLITICS_BALEIA_BAH_DESC:0 "Aliomar de Andrade Baleeiro is a native of Salvador da Bahia, where he was born and raised, and graduated from university in 1921 with a degree in law, as is all too common in Bahian politics. Having worked on several different newspapers before starting his political career, he acted as both a state and federal representative in the old political order, never having reached the heights he seeked. Now, with the status quo completely destroyed by the conflict that ended Brazil, Aliomar has positioned himself not only to be the first president of an independent and free Bahia, but also to curtail the clout of many of his long standing political opponents while increasing his own. Many believe that this is but the first step towards the beginning of a brand new political dynasty in Bahia."
POLITICS_JURACY_BAH_DESC:0 "A respected military man, Juracy gained notoriety by his fast rise in state politics in Bahia. However, the rise of such a notable outsider can usually be explained by loss of popularity and legitimacy by political leadership, and in the case of Bahia, it was the fall from grace of the oligarch JJ Seabra. Now at the helm of Bahia yet again, a fact no doubt consequential of his immense political clout on the region, but now as a sovereign state, he looks to both improve the economical situation and improve diplomatic ties with non hostile regimes to ensure better trading partners in these chaotic times."
POLITICS_GRABOIS_BAH_DESC:0 "Maurício Grabois, born in Salvador da Bahia in 1912, is descended from bessarabian jews that fled the ever growing chaos of the Russian Empire during the Russo-Japanese war to find a new life in Brazil, after a long journey. While studying at a military school, he started to lean towards radical leftism, while also becoming a staunch opposition of the ever growing integralist ideology that seemed to spread into barracks across the country then. While just 24 years old, he already was leading syndical and socialist activities, and his early rise only went further within the labour cause. After so much and war and destruction, it'd be easy to lose hope, but Mauricio sees the newfound independence of Bahia as an unparalleled opportunity for the country to truly leave its past of poverty and oligarchy behind in the dust of history. However, such things are far easier planned than done, as even with military support of the occupiers, dislodging the extremely powerful coroneis from their positions of power held for centuries may be a violent and costly endeavour for all parties involved."
POLITICS_MARIGHELLA_BAH_DESC:0 "Carlos Marighella is from Salvador, hailing from a poor family of italian father and hausa mother. Born in 1911, he was a talented student, notorious in his school for his skills with verse and prose alike, but he soon turned into politics, becoming involved in the constant confrontations that occurred between syndicalists and integralists in downtown Salvador. While he was arrested a few times, he did manage to be elected a representative in 1936, albeit that was a relatively short lived state of affairs, as he grew frustrated with his inability to actually make a difference in the station. This certainly is not the case as head of state in Bahia, where he has received support from many of his former Brazilian comrades to step up and lead the newly established commune to prosperity and socialism. However, his already old enemies in the oligarchic families of the state must be dealt with before any of these dreams can be realized."
POLITICS_JORGE_AMADO_BAH_DESC:0 "Jorge Leal Amado de Faria was born in Itabuna in 1912, and began his career as an author as early as age fourteen. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro to conclude his studies of law, and there was influenced by the many left wing intellectuals and the ideas of the revolutions in Europe, whose success seemed to inspire the left wing elites of the country. He later became a journalist, and only truly joined the political arena in the years after the tumultuous 1936 elections. While he officially defines himself as irreligious, he is in practice a practitioner of Candomblé, an african traditional faith that has many practitioners in the state of Bahia, and is well acquainted with most religious leaders in his home region. Now thrusted into the position of head of state, many question his relative lack of experience in the political arena when compared to other candidates for the task, a concern clearly not shared by the majority of representatives, evidently. While his enthusiastic approach to his new job is certainly for many welcome, he may well not be prepared for the great task of ensuring the cooperation of the disparate unions and factions in the nation."
POLITICS_MAMEDE_BAH_DESC:0 "Jurandir de Bizarria Mamede was born in Salvador in the year 1906, and from an early age prepared for a military career, gaining minor positions in the local infantry regiment by 1927; and such, he is a veteran officer of the interstate war. He then was transferred to several garrison and military police commands, always serving with distinction and climbing the ranks of the military by his own merits. While many defeated officers have chosen to shy away from public duty after the devastating that so recently ended, Jurandi has chosen to embark into the political arena, as he sees himself in the best position to re-establish the rule of law and order to the newly established Republic of Bahia. He takes a particular dislike of syndicalists, and this distance is by no means secret and quite a few of these politicians have pre-emptively left Bahia before he can decisively move against these traitors."

With the collapse of British rule in late 1925, Rai, along with other Indian socialist figureheads, proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Bengal. While the People's Republic initially failed to unite India through force, it managed to consolidate its rule over the northeastern third of the sub-continent. Rai, once relatively secure in his leadership of the People's Republic, renamed the Bharatiya Commune to indicate its ambition of unification, now faces spirited opposition from competing socialist factions. With his advanced age and waning influence, Rai has announced his intent to resign from his post. His successor may well determine the future of the Commune itself."
POLITICS_FAZLUL_HUQ_DESC:0 "Fazlul Huq, former secretary of the Bengali Muslim League, and now an avowed Syndicalist, has led his 'Moderate' faction to victory in the Indian National Congress's special session. He campaigned on a platform of trade-union centric industrialisation and the gradual implementation of socialist reform. Despite electoral success, however, Fuq still faces staunch opposition from opposing factions of the Indian National Congress. Regardless, Fuq's vision of prosperity in the historically impoverished eastern India, and perhaps one day the entire sub-continent, appears, at least to his supporters, to be increasingly achievable."
POLITICS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC:0 "As a boy, Subhas Chandra Bose once assaulted a British schoolmaster for defaming his beloved India; his expulsion thereafter left Bose with an almost rabid desire for vengeance. Shortly before the collapse of the British Raj, Bose attracted large swaths of the Indian population to the socialist cause with incendiary speeches against the all who would deny India's people sole dominion over the sub-continent. With the success of Bose's Maximists within the Indian National Congress, the Bharatiya Commune as a whole has begun to assume a similarly militaristic outlook; it now looks to strike a decisive blow to the hearts of the Dominionists and Princely Federation alike."
POLITICS_MOHANDAS_GHANDI_DESC:0 "A former lawyer, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi valued highly the gradual, peaceful, and lawful independence of India from British rule. With the collapse of the Raj, however, he and his many followers were forced to reassess their position. Though still a proponent of pacifism, Ghandi has become increasingly influenced by the ideas of his colleagues in the now radicalised Indian National Congress. Ghandi's victory in the Indian National Congress's special session has awoken renewed hope for the peaceful reunification of the Indian sub-continent and the reconciliation of its divided factions."
POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC:0 "Jawaharlal Nehru is almost certainly the most tactful of the Bharatiya Commune's prominent political leaders. With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tireless to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assuaged."
POLITICS_NIRMAL_KUMAR_BOSE_DESC:0 "Nirmal Kumar Bose, protégé of the famous Mohandas Gandhi, has assumed leadership of the Bharatiya Commune. He is likely to continue the agrarian reforms of Ghandi, and encourage the non-violent reunification of India.

Negotiating Bhutan’s place in the world following instability in both neighboring Tibet and India, Jigme has managed to retain the status quo in his mountain kingdom, though many would attribute these successes to his Gongzim and ally Sonam Topgye Dorji.  With dark clouds brewing on the horizon, there is some question as to whether Jigme can maintain his grip on the young kingdom."
POLITICS_TSHERING_PENJOR_DESC:0 "A harsh and cruel man, few doubt the effectiveness of Tshering Penjor as Druk Gyalpo.  He is a man of contradictions, quick to laugh but quicker to anger, the host of numerous concubines but no wives.

However, his education has taken him outside of the mountain kingdom and began to give him knowledge of the outside world and a desire for reform in his own realm.  While the kingdom is currently ruled by his regent Sonam Topgye Dorji, there is little doubt that King Jigme Dorji has great plans for the nation following his ascension."
POLITICS_JIGME_DORJI_OLD_DESC:0 "Having completely taken power over the nation, young king Jigme Dorji continues to rely on the advice of his Gongzim Sonam Topgye Dorji.  However, Jigme Dorji is no puppet, he seeks to totally reform the mountain kingdom along the lines of a modern western nation.  Whether or not these reforms will prove to succeed is yet to be seen, but none would question Jigme Dorji’s conviction to the betterment of his kingdom and people."
POLITICS_BHIMRAO_RAMJI_AMBEDKAR_DESC:0 "The seventeenth son of a poor Dalit officer in the British Indian Army, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was the first Dalit student in his high school, before obtaining degrees from Universities in Bombay, New York, and London.  Returning to India at the height of the Weltkrieg, he soon became a leading advocate for caste egalitarianism.  When revolution came to India, he was quick to travel to Calcutta to join the young revolutionary government.  Disappointment soon set in as the initial zeal of revolution gave way to pragmatism, and Ambedkar soon found himself politically isolated.  Once a strong supporter of the Agrarian faction of the Congress, their renewed commitment to the traditional caste system under the guidance of Mohandas Gandhi dashed his dreams of an agrarian and egalitarian state.  He drifted towards the Maximist faction, mostly due to their strong condemnation of caste politics, but was never comfortable with the rest of their political aims.  With his presence in Calcutta becoming tiresome for both Gandhi and Bose and his interest in Buddhism well known, Ambedkar was the perfect man to lead the Bharatiya mission into Bhutan.  Whether the mountainous nation is a political purgatory to imprison the rabble-rouser or the perfect canvas to display his policies is yet to be seen."

During the Chaco War, he was rewarded several times for bravery and is seen as a Bolivian war hero. With the defeat at the Chaco War, Busch allied himself with David Toro, and both couped the liberal government by Salamanca in 1934 with huge support from the army and the populace in general. Since then, Busch has been pushing reforms that have slowly but steadily improved the Bolivian situation, and the general populace holds him on high regard.

Víctor wanted to study civil engineering, but since that career wasn't available in Bolivian universities, he ended up choosing to study law at the 'Universidad Mayor de San Andrés', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, with just twenty years. When the Chaco War, Paz enlisted in the army, reaching the rank of sergeant a few months of having volunteered. During the war, he read the 'ABC of Communism' by Bukharin and the 'The Burning Question of Trade Unionism' by De Leon, which influenced Víctor towards syndicalist-leaning ideals. When the war ended, Paz served as a lawyer for a year for 'Patiño Mines', owned by the Tin King Patiño himself, where he witnessed the extent of the mining companies influence in Bolivian affairs. Outraged, he resigned and formed the 'Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario', trying to rally political moderates that wish to end the corrupt influence that private companies exercise on Bolivia's government. Now that he has managed to become President, Víctor will strive to bring about a land reform, nationalisation of key industries and better working conditions for all Bolivians."
POLITICS_ARZE_ARZE_DESC:0 "José Antonio Arze y Arze was born in 1904 in Cochabamba, Bolivia. He graduated as a lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Simón' in 1926, and then joined the 'Federación Universitaria Boliviana', where he began to be influenced by the Syndicalist ideals within the organisation. Arze y Arze, with other intelectuals of the organisation like Ricardo Anaya and Jose Cuadros Quiroga created the 'Programa de Principios', in which they stipulated that Bolivia had to nationalize the mining and oil industries, provide land for natives to work and enforce stronger work laws. However, José's radical anti-war posture forced him to leave for Chile when the Chaco War came about. He returned at the end of the war, and formed the 'Partido Sindicalista de Bolivia', gathering support from the exploited miners in the poorer areas of Bolivia. Now that Arze y Arze has managed to become President, he'll enact the 'Programa de Principios' and carry on further reforms to transform Bolivia into a revolutionary country."
POLITICS_BILBAO_RIOJA_BOL_HOS_DESC:0 "Bernardino Bilbao Rioja was born in 1895 in the small county of Arampampa, Potosí province, Bolivia. Bernardino entered the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' when he was 17, earning a scholarship for the Military Academy in Chile, where he graduated as an Infantry second lieutenant in 1918, and became a pilot in 1919. In 1926, already with the rank of Major, he founded the 'Escuela de Aviación de Bolivia', becoming a pioneer in Bolivian aviation. He became a national hero during the Chaco war, standing out for his bravery and excellent organisation skills. However, the defeat against the Paraguayans have drastically changed Bilbao Rojas political stance, leading him to form the Partido Nacionalista Boliviano. Now that he's in power, he'll try to centralize power under himself and reinforce the army with the goal of reclaiming Bolivia's lost glory, whatever the cost may be."

POLITICS_THE_KINGTIN_DESC:0 "Simón Iturri Patiño, better known as the 'Tin King', was born in 1860 in the small town of Santibáñez, Cochabamba province, Bolivia. He began working as an administrator in the 'Compañia Minera Huanchaca', then moving on to a trading company and finally working as miner in Huanchaca. He'd discover an extremely rich vein of tin in 1900, forming his own mining company to exploit it, and with the profits, he began buying over his competition. By 1924, Patiño already had already bought foundries in Canada and Germany, forming the 'Patiño Mines and Enterprises Consolidated Inc.'. He has used his vast wealth to influence Bolivian public affairs since 1929, using the Partido Liberal Popular as a façade to pass his reforms.

Thanks to the Partido Liberal Popular's influence, he was able to return to Bolivia for the 1940's election. He is a prolific writer, making several books and essays regarding the harsh Bolivian reality, and now that he has become President, he'll try to liberalize the inefficient Bolivian bureaucracy and help the common citizen have a better standard of living.

POLITICS_OTAVIO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "Otavio made his politcal debut in 1908 at the contentious politics of the state of Bahia, and his rapid rise in notoriety gave him fame, and some exiles from the state as well. Said notoriety was enough for him to later become a State Representative in 1912. His staunch positions in favour of the late Washington Luis and João Pessoa during the times of civil helped to raise his profile to greater heights, and he was elected president of the State of Bahia in the elections organized there in 1928. Later, as consensus bid for the Brazilian Republican Party, his name was put foward for the position of President of the Republic, and was endorsed by then President João Pessoa. His presidency was very much a return to normalcy at first, but the rise of radical movements especially in the cities, and public order in general, is a rising concern. However, the good pace of economic and political recovery has ensured his popularity remains high, and it is possible that some of this popularity is why João Mangabeira, his brother, became a household name more left wing circles."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_DODT_DESC:0 "Hailing from the Northeastern state of Ceará, Gustavo Dodt Barroso is one of the nation's most influential intellectuals and the leader of the Brazilian Integralist Action. While he's an accomplished author since age 23, his entry in the political arens came after watching a passionate speech about the values of Integralism by important figure, Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, in 1928. Ever since he has dedicated himself to helping push the movement's agenda, writing several well selling books on the subject, but also his own anti-semitic views, especially in the first translated copy of the Protocols of the Heirs of Zion in Brazilian Portguese, and also dedicates himself to poetry and studies of Brazilian folklore, which garnered him a seat at the Brazilian Academy of Letters. His profound nationalism and hatred of precieved foreign meddling made him gain especial disdain and hatred for Syndicalists in Brazil, whom he claims are French spies sent to establish a puppet republic."
POLITICS_GETULIO_VARGAS_BRA_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the border state of Rio Grande do Sul, Getúlio Vargas always had a knack for politics. Since his earliest forays into state politics, he always was a skilled navigator and, according to some, a shrewd manipulator. While he only entered politics in 1913, by the time of the Revolution of 27 he was already State President of his home province, and his diplomatic skill managed to both prevent intervention from foreigners and to ensure that Rio Grande do Sul sided against the Federal forces. After the war, Vargas became Vice President under João Pessoa, and became far more well known nation wide, taking time to appear in radio and other public adresses as a man ''looking out for the little guy'' while he could do so. Since Otávio Mangabeira took office, he spent four years articulating an energic presidential campaign. Always professing non extreme, but powerful views on the future of Brazil, Vargas believes that the only way the nation can truly enter the modern era is through and extensive campaign of industralisation, modernisation and rearmament, a process that he believes no person or law has any right to impede, for his intention is to always act with Brazil's best intentions first and foremost."

Respected for his efforts during the Civil War and beyond, the officer has enough gravitas to pull together a haphardly government, which is more or less a dictatorship all but in name, to keep order in this time of extreme crisis. He has a very public disdain of Syndicalism and all forms and socialist and has personally overseen the crushing of several revolts of this nature over the past decade."

A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devasted by his sudden assassination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington. Following the defeat of Bahia's liberals in the previous elections, Julio found himself as an almost unanimous choice for candiate of the Liberal Party, and his victory again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positvist principles he defended throughout his life."

POLITICS_ABILIO_NEQUETE_DESC:0 "An orthodox christian hailing from Lebanon, Abilio de Nequete is actually not his birth name, that being Abdo Nakt. He came to Brazil looking for his father, who had emigrated years earlier than him, in 1903, and reuinted with him shortly thereafter. However, soon their political differences put a wedge on their relationships, and later on  Abilio converted to Spiritism and joined union circles. Inspired by the revolutions in Europe, he joined the anarchist International Workers Union, but their militant atheism caused him and some other men to split off and form the Maximalist Union, a party that opposed their ideas in more matters than just religion. The Maximalist movement grew and garned much strength in Porto Alegre, but still he faced opposition from anarchist unions, who were still the majority in the city, but his influence grew with time. In recent years, he was influenced by other centralist socialists abroad, and his Maximalist Union was one of the many leftist movements to support the so called Democratic Left. He is well respected by most Syndicalists in Brazil, even if his scathing and combative personality got him kicked out of more than one meeting. To him, Brazil's many issues after a decade of chaos can only be solved by a firm hand and unity among the people, a view shared by many army and navy officers. However, anarchists are still the biggest opponents to him in the political arena."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVEIRA_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his yearliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key turning point in the electoral race, and he became nationally known after the endorsement, Thrusted into his new position by the first congress of trade unions, Mangabeira is the first black president and the first syndicalist to occupy the highest office in the country, and the nation holds its breath to see what will come to pass during the Oliveira government."
POLITICS_MACIEL_BRA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Olegário his political career all the way back in 1880, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot on the grave'' is dangerous for Brazilian democracy, the three time state president of Minas Gerais' politcal power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. His long support of Vargas in the Republican Party can be seen as ideological similarities, as both see a united and proactive federal government as vital for a better Brazil, but their alliance is often seen as one of convenience between the most powerful politicians of two powerful states of the Union. While his platform during elections was mostly a repeat of Vargas's 10 years ago, the ''old man president'' doesnt really considers the southerner his sucessor, as he envisions Gustavo Capanema as the one to inherit his political legacy in Brazil as a whole."
POLITICS_BORGES_DE_MEDEIROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Few men alive had as much of an impact in Brazilian politics, and especially in the Rio Grande do Sul state, as Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros, known politically by his last two names. Starting his political career in the 1890s, he swiftly rose through the ranks and assumed the position of state president from 1898 to 1908 and from 1913 to 1926, and was at the centre of the innumerable political crises, revolts and intrigues in Rio Grande do Sul during the timeframe, while also steadily rising to national proimience. Considered by many a man of unparalleled charisma and integrity, Borges refused a judicial position early in his life, in 1892, to focus entirely on politics, and has always tried to strike a balance between his ideas for a progressive Brazil and the whirlwind of political forces in his country and state. Having positioned himself very publically in favour of São Paulo in 1927, his views on the integrity of the state's soverignty remain unchanged, as does his disdain for any centralizing overtures by the goverment in Rio de Janeiro. Now elected president at nearly his eighties, his positivist beliefs are staunchier than ever, after the national-level schsim of the liberal party and a contested electoral race. While establishing a parliamentary majority and governing the large democracy is a challenge, Borges' gravitas and personal charm will no doubt play an important role in keeping the republic on the way to progress" 
POLITICS_PRESTES_MAIA_BRA_DESC:0 "Maia is not a politican by trade, but rather a civil engineer thursted to the position after his sucess in planning and reparing the infrastructure in São Paulo's most affected areas by the civil war, and his plan to completely remodel that state's streets has made great strides in the last decade, which made him the man of the hour in these elections. His beliefs clashed with other, older politicians and less liberally inclined members of the party, but his urban remodelling and subsequent tenure as Mayor of São Paulo made him well known nation wide, and thus he was picked to lead the splinter liberal ticket. His lack of political experience, especially at the national arena, may make his government quite the eventful affair, as his plans to remodel the country's fiscal and infrastructure systems may very well find stiff resistance in parliament, even with his own party's views. However, the fact that a man that isnt an establishment politician managed to enter the Catete is seen well by most of the populace"

While previously a member of the Liberal party, Nereu joined the Democratic Left during the last elections at the urging of Mangabeira, as to make sure that the party is not seen as dangerous leftist outsiders, and because his own frustrations at the apparent lack of changes after the crisis in 27.

Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon was shocked to find after an expedition that Brazil's ruling Integralist party was not only plotting to restore the monarchy, but also had seemingly ordered his arrest. He took up arms, and was joined by many across the country who loathed the monarchist and populist rethoric of the Integralists, but still was at a severe strategic disadvantadge. However, his knowldege of local terrain and lifetime of military experience, coupled with uprisings dividing the attention of the oversteched federal govermnent, allowed his revolution to succeed. Now he rules as interim president, leading a process of de-intoxicating Brazil from the monarchist disease until the next elections come, and law and order are properly restored to the nation. "

POLITICS_JOSE_AMERICO_DE_ALMEIDA_BRA_DESC:0 "José Americo de Almeida was born in the small town of Areia, Parahyba, in 1887, and became a public prosecutor in the city of Souza, in that same state, shortly after graduating from law school. He rose quickly, becoming state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the party his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While the victory at the elections may be seen as a surprise, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire nation of Brazil, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, already as a young man opposing the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of 1936 has been long left behind. His stances on economical and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the ever eventful politics of Brazil may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."
POLITICS_ASSIS_BRA_DESC:0 "A true old timer of Rio Grande do Sul politics, Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brasil is a well respected politician, backed by his years of experience dealing with both local and national party members. His career started in 1884, still in the waning years of the Empire, and he became an important figure during the Old Republic era, even if at a national level he was often overshadowed by other natives of his state, he performed very important roles, including vital diplomatic missions to Argentina, Mexico, the USA and more. A true gaucho, Joaquim adores the free country life of the plains, even if he is not advised to ride horses anymore due to his advanced age. Still, he always associated the freedom of the gaucho rider with that of the republican freedoms, and even if not a separatist, places a deep value to the traditions of a state. He is also a prolific historical and political writer, even if some of the concepts proposed in his books, like that of an ''voting machine'' to prevent fraud, do seem truly outlandish. While his victory has led to rabid optimism by most party members, he knows that keeping control of the lower house may well be a far more difficult affair than they predict, as the Liberal majority is tenuous at best, and the party remains relatively fractured even after the split."
POLITICS_AFONSO_FEATHER_JUNIOR_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Santa Barbara in Minas Gerais, Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena Júnior started his career like many other local politicians, studying law and becoming a state representative. Even though he is a very successful liberal and a respected literary intellectual, he always had to deal with the looming shadow that his father, former President Afonso Pena, whose achievements and legacy always seemed impossible to match. But now, he too has become president of Brazil, but unlike his father, who was frustrated at every turn by powerful landlords and political opponents, Junior is determined to advance and modernize the Brazilian nation to the standard enjoyed by other nations, especially in its farthest reaches, both in terms of education and infrastructure development. However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, for even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Brazil, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_JOAO_GOULART_BRA_DESC:0 "João Belchior Marques Goulart, known by the common people by the nickname Jango, hails from a family of powerful landowners in Rio Grande do Sul. While he is a relatively young man, his career in politics saw a rapid rise since it's start in the 1940s, but before that he studied law and notably was a youth player for Internacional in Porto Alegre before entering the political arena, under the auspices of his father, the rather powerful Vicente Goulart. He has always been a bit more left leaning than his father however, and his election may well be the shake-up the left in Brazil needed in this decade, as many of the old slogans and talking points have been rendered moot by changes in legislation. Frequently accused of being a syndicalist or a populist, Jango is steadfast in his moderate stance, defending that all voices are heard, but also vehemently denying claims of syndicalism. This so called ‘softness’ towards what many in Brazil consider dangerous radicals may well cause instability during his rule, as Republican political forces already prepared to thwart his every move in congress. It seems that winning the elections is just the first of many battles head of Jango's presidency."
POLITICS_OSVALDO_ARANHA_BRA_DESC:0 "Osvaldo Euclides de Sousa Aranha hails from the town of Alegrete, in Rio Grande do Sul. Ever since the earliest points of his career, he has been seen as both a reliable mediator and a skilled administrator, skills sorely necessary in a state where political violence was at a breaking point until the state presidency of Getúlio Vargas, a man who is one of his closest allies and friends, and it's a common occurrence to see both side by side. Having spent most of his career as a diplomat after the Civil War, he returned to Brazil and politics at the request of his longtime friend, as a consensus candidate was sorely needed in the ranks of the ever fractured Republican party, even if the party itself is not nearly as divided and decentralized as it was during the early 1930s. His remarkable experience as a mediator is surely to be invaluable as the head of state, and it's widely predicted that his demeanour and relatively moderate stances will ensure one of the most stable and hopefully prosperous presidencies in Brazil's republican history, as his party gives him an extremely comfortable political position at the Catete. His years as a diplomat will also hopefully help with diplomacy abroad, as Brazil looks more than ever outwards in these new times."
POLITICS_JK_BRA_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the son of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the Germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War. Afterwards, he began his by now very long political career. While he is a well known figure in Belo Horizonte, where he even ran for the office of mayor in the past, and has been a representative in Rio multiple times, his clout outside of his home state has always been somewhat limited, even after the victory in the election, as the Liberal party has to juggle with opposition at every corner of congress. However, even with these issues, JK, as he is more commonly known to the public, has big plans. Not just urban renewal, infrastructure investments or political reforms, he is a very vocal proponent of the proposal of moving the capital of the nation further inland to push development in the great hinterlands of the Cerrado plains, which would be an outrageously expensive endeavour. Regretfully for him, and thankfully for the state budget some say, such a proposal is already dead on arrival, with massive opposition from several groups in parliament and prominent newspapers."
POLITICS_LANDRY_SALES_DESC:0 "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While he did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances while keeping his militarist political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. His nomination by the party was somewhat contested, but the true challenge will be to retain control of congress with a significant house minority, especially since there is little chance of the Liberal factions cooperating even this long after their political split, albeit there is nothing a few ministerial positions can’t solve, some say. Regardless, his presidency is probably going to be one of the most difficult affairs in recent memory, but the man is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."

While a teacher, she has worked on special schools to help other jews fleeing Europe in the following decades of chaos and unrest on the continent. Having been a political activist from a very young age, Elisa was one of the few openly socialist politicians to run for office under the ED umbrella and succeed in the contentious 1936 elections, being always a voice for the worker's movement in parliament. Her general political experience put her ahead of the pack in the selection process for chairman, but even still gathering the necessary support was by no means an easy feat, as Brazil's unions are even more decentralized in terms of ideology and state lines than the previous parties once were. Now in power and leading Brazil's nascent socialist government, Elisa has to deal with a tumultuous foreign and internal political landscape, and ensure that the planned industrialization and development programs go on as planned. Thankfully, the worst, more shaky years of the new status quo seems to be the in past, and she seems more than capable of achieving her goals."

Despite the fallout of their coalition's perceived failures, and the many political issues since arisen, she has not faltered in her desire to establish a broad left front to improve the situation in Brazil, even if it means great compromises with the Social Democrats and other traditional political forces in the country. Now known nationwide as the 'Red Senator' after a long tenure maintaining worker's rights at the forefront, she has to assuage military personnel's rampant fear of a syndicalist coup, as her proposals, while seen as overly moderate by her fellow syndicalists, are extremely radical for a nation like Brazil. However, the longstanding dissatisfaction of the common people with the seemingly endless inability of the federal government to end poverty, unemployment and other far more pressing concerns than ideological disagreements have ensured she managed to win a democratic election and become the first female to do so. Now she has to deal not only with the traditionally conservative elites, but with a constantly divided and bickering powerbase in an even less stable legislature; and yet she wholly believed she can turn Brazil's fortunes around for good."

He started working at age 13 on a major Paulista newspaper, but his studies later turned towards law, as is all to common for Brazilian politicians. A long time anti-clerical and anti-censorship advocate, Everardo was writing about his political thoughts as early as 1902, and has partook in most great strikes and political actions by socialist and anarchist elements in São Paulo in this century, being one of the most recognizable figures of the movement. His long and storied history with the labour movement was doubtlessly a chief factor to see his name put forward by the congress of trade unions as the head of their council, but he also is a conciliatory and non radical figure, always defending differing viewpoints and the right of non socialist opposition do demonstrate and even put forward candidates for certain offices. While some claim this comes from a misguided sense of camaraderie with his fellow freemasons and former political associates in the republican era, the truth is simply his ever staunch defence of free speech, as a system that cannot withstand criticism is not strong enough to do real change in a country as vast and unequal as Brazil."

Always having been a prolific artist, he started his career as a helper in the restoration of churches in his hometown, and at just age 16 he moved to Rio to enrol in the national school of arts, where his talent was immediately recognized. Since then, his position as one of the foremost artists of the nation has solidified, but his political career is far more recent, having only in recent times become truly active as an elected union representative. While his political experience is somewhat limited, his talent and intellect made him well known, and as with many other elections, this fame placed him an advantageous position when compared to his fellow candidates. While it's certainly an advantage for a head of state to be such a respected artist, especially on the international level, many raise concerns about having such an inexperienced man as head of state."
POLITICS_DJALMA_MARANHAO_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the revolution, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Brazil's socialist government, and seeks to turn development efforts to northeast, as he feels previous governments have put the needs of urban, industrial workers ahead of the great many Brazilians who still work on the fields and on small towns across the nation. Such a paradigm shift is popular in non central regions, but naturally less so in Rio, São Paulo and other major urban centers. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."

Author of multiple books, most of his political life has been dedicated towards left wing causes, which he formally joined in the early 1930s. While he did run for office under the ED umbrella in the 1936 elections, he was ultimately frustrated by the political games of parliament, and was one of the advocates of changing the legislative to its current form in the congress of trade unions. Having always leaned towards a more european ideal of syndicalism, Otto's views fit well with the Internationale's official stances, but much less so with the majority of anarchists and socialists in the congress of trade unions."
POLITICS_JOAO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "João Mangabeira started out as a noteworthy defence attorney in Ilhéus, before turning to politics like his brother, former president Otávio. Early on in his career he was a close and passionate follower of Rui Barbosa, but after his mentor's passing, he carved a career of its own as a federal representative of the state of Bahia. A man with deeply rooted anti-authoritarian principles, he was a vocal supporter of Bahia's role in the civil conflict, and gained notoriety as a result. As his career went by, the continuous and yet seemingly fruitless struggle of Brazil's poor brought him closer to the left, and while he certainly has some socialist views and allies in union and intellectual circles, he certainly is no Syndicalist. His plan for Brazil was to build a broad leftist front to oppose the current status quo, and his success was unexpected, but probably not unpredictable considering the social upheaval following Black Monday and the scandalous repression of labour movements nationwide. Now, he has to juggle the several disparate factions in his left front while keeping the ravenous opposition at bay, and it seems his presidency is certainly going to be as eventful as his brother's."

He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. One of the most enthusiastic supporters of the counter-coup that brought about the revolution in Brazil, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country are being too slow and gradual, and doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the revolution. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army.

POLITICS_JORGE_AMADO_DESC:0 "Jorge Leal Amado de Faria was born in Itabuna, Bahia, in 1912, and began his career as an author as early as age fourteen. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro to conclude his studies of law, and there was influenced by the many left wing intellectuals and the ideas of the revolutions in Europe, whose success seemed to inspire the left wing elites of the country. He later became a journalist, and only truly joined the political arena in the years after the tumultuous 1936 elections. While he officially defines himself as irreligious, he is in practice a practitioner of Candomblé, an african traditional faith that has many practitioners in the state of Bahia, and is well acquainted with most religious leaders in his home region. Now thrust into the position of head of state, many question his relative lack of experience in the political arena when compared to other candidates for the task. While his enthusiastic approach to his new job is certainly for many welcome at a time where revolutionary fervour is cooling down, he may well not be prepared for the great task of ensuring the cooperation of the disparate unions and factions in the nation."

His role in the modernist is quite extensive, with some coming as far as calling him it's founder and main proponent. While he used to be married to Patricia Rehder Galvão, who is more known by her nickname Pagu, the marriage broke down in less than half a decade, as did his previous marriage to another renowned artist, Tarsila do Amaral. While he is known for generally humoured and spirited demeanour, he also is described as combative and often aggressive in arguments, which may explain his relationship's short duration. Still, his charisma carried him with relative ease to a victory in swaying the congress of trade unions to choose him as the leader of the revolution, a task he plans to take on very seriously. While his literary and artistic identity is well defined, few can guess what kind of leader he will be on the international arena, and the nation now pays close attention whether he will make friends or enemies when meeting with foreign diplomats."

He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publicly, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age. Having taken the lead of the entirety of Brazil is one thing, but properly leading the extremely disparate and decentralized factions is another matter entirely. While he calmly believes matters will be sorted shortly and that the revolutionary process will continue smoothly, many wonder if his relative lack of contacts in upper syndicalist circles in major centres of the south may leave him isolated in his own cabinet."

Such a sudden change came when her cousin Waldemar Ripoll was assassinated in 1936, allegedly on the orders of one of the major local strongmen, Flores da Cunha. This strengthened her resolve, and compelled her to join the unions in their strikes. Her determination to make a positive impact, constant and active political presence, and rising renown among the Unions of Brazil, who see her and her story as a symbol of worker's struggle, and of merit and competency, made her a natural choice to run for the post of chairwoman by the unions of Rio Grande do Sul, and their pitch has been welcomed by the Congress, who named Lila their leader.

Shortly after her first job at age 15, she joined the A Rua newspaper as a reporter, a fact so unprecedented a brand new work was coined for a female reporter, reportisa. She was one of the key figures in the suffragette movement, and she also became the first major female political figure in leftist and modernist circles, and in these same circles she met her future husband, the poet Álvaro Moreyra, whom she married in 1914. Having been among the earliest members of the PSB and the ED alongside her closest associates like Oswald de Andrade and Carlos Lacerda, she has a longstanding influence on the going's on of the left wing in capital of Rio, and therefore the entire nation, for decades, and this influence has made her one of the key figures of the new Union of Brazil.

Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the congress, with the backing of several northeastern delegates behind her.

She has always defended a position where women of all categories must join to fight for their rights, but also against divisive rhetoric that paints men as an enemy of women, which she saw as shallow and petty. Her position at the forefront of socialist movements has landed her more than one tenure in jail, but also great fame and acclaim in political circles.

He has climbed the ranks in the PR very quickly, and while he is a capable man, this is in no small part due to the immense influence wielded by his close friend and associate Getúlio Vargas, as he is one of the few that has the gaucho's trust. His nomination and election campaign had Vargas's widespread support, as cartoonists often drew Capanema as little more than his sockpuppet. But despite these attacks, he remains a staunch ally to Vargas, who now leads his political articulation in congress to ready for a smooth republican government. While many rejoice the stability of the orderly elections, some worry that the oligarchs of the plantations of the old republic have been replaced with a new type of politician, far more cunning and malleable. Capanema, of course, knows these to be only the rumblings of a defeated and scattered opposition, as the many newspapers under republican control will surely begin sharing in the coming months.

USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Born in 1893 to an impoverished family, Omar Bradley grew up with a love for athletics and firearms. In fact, after a talented baseball career in high school, he was offered a spot in several professional teams, but he declined to pursue a future in the military. Bradley became a military instructor and eventually became acquainted with George Marshall, who described him as "quiet, unassuming, capable, with sound common sense". More recently, Bradley taught at West Point, then studied at the U.S. Army War College. Bradley has undergone a meteoric rise in rank in the various recent American crises; a shortage in the American military leadership means that he is one of the first men called upon to lead. His boss, George Marshall, once said that you could give Bradley a job and forget about it. Now though, he must perform the job of a lifetime: saving America from itself. Douglas MacArthur has assumed control of the country, and partly due to the animosity between the two men, partly due to his high rank, Bradley has been sent to lead Federal forces in the West. He will be assisted in this task by Dwight Eisenhower, a man who Bradley trusts and respects far more than MacArthur. This 'Western Command Center' will theoretically exist only so long as rebels exist; once they have are defeated, it will be reincorporated into the United States. However, if Douglas MacArthur fails to fulfill his promise of stepping down once the crisis is over, desperate measures may need to be taken to ensure the contiuation of democracy in America..."

POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "Born in 1890 to a family tracing its presence in America to the eighteenth-century, Dwight D. Eisenhower had an eventful childhood. He had many interests, but chief among them was a love for military history, inspired by his mother's history book collection. Eisenhower was eventually accepted into West Point, where he tried his hand at a variety of sports, though none would hold his love more than playing cards. Eisenhower met Omar Bradley, a man with whom he would develop a close friendship, at West Point, and the two have both progressed in the military since. Eisenhower's organizational abilities first shined in this period of his life, but they only became more apparent to all observers once he began to command men and units. He held the rank of major for sixteen years but continued gaining prestige and influence within the military, working with men such as George S. Patton, John J. Pershing, Fox Conner, Douglas MacArthur, and George Marshall. As for MacArthur, it seems that destiny, fate, or whatever else one decides to believe in has put these two men together. Eisenhower has served as one of MacArthur's top men, and though the two have had vehement disagreements, Eisenhower has downplayed that part of their relationship, noting that they have always had a good relationship. However, as the two fought over MacArthur's reaction to the Bonus March in 1932, so too have they fought over MacArthur's increasing involvement over politics. Eisenhower had publicly supported the Federal and MacArthurite lines, but they had argued behind the scenes. During the war, Ike was given joint control over Federal lands in the West with Omar Bradley as a general, a position he held even as enemies surrounded his men on all sides. Eisenhower worried that MacArthur would not relinquish his power once the Civil War was over, and it appears his fears were well founded. Despite this, Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower have restored democracy to America, though neither man fully trusts the government, and have kept some of their power in a bid to prevent future crises from emerging. Eisenhower is a war hero, and the American people love him; adults write adoring letters to him, and those who know him best challenge him to a game of bridge every so often. Children sing "I like Ike" on playgrounds and even the elderly have good things to say about him. For Eisenhower though, his work has only just begun."

Du Bois was one of the founders of the NCAAP, and one of the leaders of the Niagara Group, a group that opposed Booker Washington’s Atlanta Compromise. However, this would be just a page in his lifelong fight for equality, as throughout he fought against Lynchings, Jim Crow laws, and other discriminatory practices. He used his prominence as an author to spread his message to the wider world, with many regarding his work as cornerstones in the fight for Civil Rights all across America. Yet as the nation fell apart, the civil rights dilemma fell on deaf ears to the establishment. And with the outbreak of Civil War, it became clear that equality would not be came by peacefully.

His charisma and style of preaching turning his congregation from a disorganized and small group of Black Patrons to a massive interracial congregation. And along with James F.

Due to this, president at the time Woodrow Wilson vetoed his promotion; throughout the following years white officers attempted to deny Young his promotion.

He became an ardent follower of Fard and his ideology. Eventually Fard turned leadership of the Detroit Chapter over to Muhammad, and had the organization renamed to the “Nation of Islam”. When Fard disappeared, Elijah Muhammad was quick to take leadership of the NOI. As America collapsed and the Black Revolt begun, Muhammad declared to his followers to rise up alongside them.

He certainly will not give up the country to socialists, who he loathes more than almost anyone else. His ideology, fittingly termed "Garveyism", has caught on in the Black Belt Republic.

Graduating from the Sofia Military School, Boris joined the Bulgarian military as an officer and took part in the Balkan wars and later the Weltkrieg, earning respect from both German and Bulgarian soldiers alike despite his young age, and rapidly rising through the ranks until becoming one of the heads of the Bulgarian military itself. As his father aged after the Weltkrieg, Boris took more and more state responsibilities onto himself, experience that will prove useful with his recent ascension to power. Now Tsar Boris the III hopes to continue his father's legacy and reassert Bulgarian hegemony across the Balkans."

POLITICS_GEORGE_DESC:0 "The King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has ruled for 26 years now, assuming control in 1910 over the vast British Empire, an Empire on which the sun could never set, but these past 26 years have been one tragedy after another for the King-Emperor- losing a war to his cousin, the death of his youngest son, John, and the final exile of the British monarchy to Canada, privately noted as "a frozen prison" by the King-Emperor. At last, it seemed as the sun had set on the British Empire, and a sense of hopelessness pervaded through to King George's once stoic nature. The years since 1925 have seen the King-Emperor's health grow steadily worse through a mixture of stress and depression, causing Prince Edward to assume more duties from the sick King (much to his chagrin)."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC:0 "Prince Albert of Windsor, younger Brother of British king Edward VIII, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Canadians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Canadian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With Edward occupied with the reconstruction of the recently reconquered Britain, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Canada is properly governed."
POLITICS_ROBERT_POPHAM_DESC:0 "Robert Brooke-Popham, a general of the royal flying core during the Weltkrieg, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Brooke-Popham has always been an administrator above all else, and was essential in the establishment of the Royal Air Force as an independent branch of the British, and later Canadian, armed forces. With his appointment to Quartermaster General of the Canadian armed forces, materiel shortages fell and efficiency rose greatly. It was on this basis that king Edward, too occupied overseeing the reconstruction of the United Kingdom to govern Canada, appointed Brooke-Popham as Canada's first Governor-General since the British Revolution."
POLITICS_FREDERICK_BANTING_DESC:0 "Frederick Banting, renowned scientist, and the first man to identify insulin and its function, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. While a researcher may see an odd choice for Governor-General, Banting has been of great importance to Canada. With the turmoil wrought by the British Revolution, Banting was instrumental in facilitating the immigration of thousands of British intellectuals to Canada, and the subsequent reorganisation of Canada's military research apparatus. With king Edward's, busy supervising the reconstruction of Britain, decision to delegate the choice of Governor-General to the Canadian parliament, appointing such a public figure and veteran administrator as Banting was a sound choice."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VANIER_DESC:0 "Georges Vanier, French-Canadian general responsible for the mitigation of Anglo-Quebecois tensions following the British Revolution, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Vanier is a grizzled veteran of both the battlefields of the Weltkrieg, where he lost his right leg, and the challenges of military administration alike. Vanier is an iconic symbol of duty to many Canadians, and as a French-Canadian himself, especially the Quebecois. Fluent in both French and English, and loyal to Canada foremost, Vanier was the logical choice for the Canadian parliament for the position of Governor-General when king Edward, busy with the reconstruction of Britain, chose to delegate the decision to them."

In 1891, his father was exiled for opposing President José Manuel Balmaceda. Despite his early opposition to the ruling authorities, he joined the Chilean naval academy in 1892. Exiled due to his socialist tendencies, he was chosen to perform a role as a liason in Great Britain, effectivelt just to keep him out of Chile. But there he took part in the Revolution, and during his exile, During the rule of President Ibañez Del Campo, Chile's economy worsened and in 1931 the country went bankrupt. Shortly after this, Ibañez was deposed when most of the army and navy mutinied, allowing for Grove's return to Chile and the proclamation of the Socialist Republic. His recent ascetion to the post of Chairman is one that clearly signals that both Military and Civil authorities in Chile consider conflict with Argentina nigh inevitable after years of support for the Patagonian rebels."

## Combined Syndicates of America ##
POLITICS_CSA_CENTRAL_COMITTEE_DESC:0 "The victory of the working class is the collective victory of all true Americans. The American people of old still coalesce around the Central Committee as did the founders around the Constitutional Convention, though our goals be more noble. Here the liberators of socialism debate the future of our nation, and factions that John Reed united now form under their own visions of the future."
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_FLYNN_DESC:0 "At a dusty underground socialist club in Harlem, Elizabeth Flynn's life as an advocate began. An early organizer for the IWW in New Jersey, Flynn felt the blunt of the political wrath against forming trade unions, and was arrested ten times. Flynn helped found the ACLU, which organized legal defence for strikers in the days before the International Labor Defence. In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organize the Longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate. Some thought it absurd that a woman would stand at the forefront of the revolution, but the rebel girl herself had been at the spearhead all along, fighting since the founding of the IWW and now ready to build up a socialist America of her dreams."
POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "Norman Thomas has seen the highs and lows of social stature, and has remained dedicated to socialism the entire way through. From a newspaper boy to Princeton magna cum laude to conscientious objector, he has seen much and more of the world, but his time as a minister was perhaps the most important. By then an advocate of christian socialism, he decided to run for office. Prior to the Civil War, he had served as New York City's Mayor, and then as the vice-presidential candidate of Jack Reed. Inspired by the writings of Edward Bellamy, Thomas pivoted his pacifism during the war into advocacy for socialists living in the Federal lands to resist conscription and even create utopian societies for themselves. After the war, he used the experience he gained and his close friendship to Jack Reed to catapult him to prominence in the country. Preaching on behalf of the Nationalists, he lead the democratic socialists to victory in the constitutional convention. With a heart of gold and unshakable morals, Norman Thomas has ascended to the presidency."
POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "Born in Kansas, in the year of 1891, Browder became a committed socialist age 16. His adherence to the socialist party of America was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Z Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favored an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Bolshevism, reinterpretations of Maximism, and plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of industrial unionism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous religious elements within the socialist state. Browder has never abandoned the socialist party of America, but with his new authoritarian position he intends to ensure that the party will never abandon him."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "A radical labor organizer who spearheaded the syndicalist movement in America, William Z Foster has practically become a legend on the American left. His leadership in the strikes of the early 20th century and his commitment that the Socialist Party of America adapt Syndicalist policies has cemented him as one of its chief ideologies. His famous manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America" has served as the guidebook for every aspiring Totalist in the country, containing Foster's culminated ideals for how to rebuild the nation of America into what it is today. With the recent victories of the Vanguard movement of the Combined Syndicates, Foster was uplifted to lead the new nation. Several of Foster's older, more socially ambitious ideas now come to the fore. This includes plans to reform the socialist human being as a whole, and to re-orient American morals towards the vanguard of socialism."
POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the socialist party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists made Cannon adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organize foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon would immediately start to build the momentum needed to run for president, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organizer and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, he survived multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW has now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United states seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian American brigade out of New England and into the CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence. Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organizer of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the U.S's entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labor by promoting partisan Jewish organisations above Zionist labor groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of 36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labor conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry, of which he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C as it came to be known was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organizer for the IWW. A proud wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionized workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Frank Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too hold to fight personally, Frank helped organize a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labor politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Fran where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of SF broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a General Strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Harry Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the second American civil war as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected president, of a whole new America!"
POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate on 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Bill Haywood. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and sombre Stedman has run a successful race to become the new president, intent on honoring his old friend's utopian dreams."

POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses, until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl to join the American Socialist party and move to Chicago. The young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate, becoming the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He soon managed to use his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a democratic and republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successfully campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his dad crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V Debs. He ran for the senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organize fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a laborer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic, now hiding under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis", to help organize Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventually presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in Seattle's streets. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he has gladly pursued!"
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed England a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organizing the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second civil war, she was a political representative of her union in Washington D.C, but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same grueling political manoeuvring that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike, she has become the new President!"
POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "Dubinsky came from the former Russian Empire to America, a Polish Jew who had spent his early life organizing bunds, leading strikes and campaigning for the Bolsheviks. These actions netted him a prison sentence in Siberia, but the young Dubinsky managed to miraculously escape back to western Russia and catch a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further co-operation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the American civil war. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky ceased to compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he had been singing the praises of the new America, and already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural born rights."
POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labor movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the steel belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910 he moved to Chicago and lead his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative in their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honor his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organize the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican Border during the Mexican Revolution, a year later returning to Minnesota but soon discovering himself to be blacklisted from employment because his trade union activism. Pursuing a career in firefighting, then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletariat and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for presidency."
POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a position of Docent at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming Civil War abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania, in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organized a student strike at Wilberforce University, which he was expelled over. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organizer and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin color and known homosexual relationships have for long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has powered through regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers, during his time at boarding school he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian Socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian Socialist, Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labor in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General, and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable. In the revolution's darkest moment, he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to take on the job as the temporarily acting president of the new America until the scars torn open by totalism can once again be healed."
POLITICS_PRESIDENT_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "A Marine, a General, and even a Senator, Smedly Butler has not been idle in recent years. Few expected, though, that he would ascend to the presidency, but this shocking turn of events has occurred. With the war over, Butler has committed himself to the political realm, becoming the country's leader militarily as well as politically. He considers himself a part of the Nationalist faction, having been inspired by Bellamy's ideas in his earlier years, and will now work to advance their platform on the national stage. Many have likened him to George Washington, and it is certainly true that the two war heroes have led the country through the hardships of their times with immense support behind them. With this support and Butler's own determination, there is no doubt he will bring his vision to life."
POLITICS_JAMES_BURNHAM_DESC:0 "A fellow-travelor of the far-left ever since he's been politically active, James Burnham began as a starry-eyed supporter of the Russian Revolution before seeing it quashed. His hope in socialism was revitalized with the British and French Revolutions only to witness the Empires of old not only persist but reform themselves internally. Influenced by French Sorelianism and his personal readings of Machiavelli he has come to view politics as largely a power struggle between competing elites with revolutions only temporarily succeeding in nations that failed to modernize their elite into a "Managerialist" class of technocratic minds as opposed to the aristocrats and capitalists of old. Viewing imperialist expansion as an inevitable consequence of their growing bureaucracies and promotion of national myths Burnham is dismayed by what he views as the infighting and factionalism promoted by traditional syndicalism and views socialism's only hope as being the promotion of a highly technocratic-oriented leadership alongside an American Nationalism that shall glue the nation together where socialism can not. His American Worker's Party (AWP) is currently a combination of his followers who de facto left the SPA's Federalist faction with him, Lovestoneites, national-syndicalists and Howard Scott's Technocratic Movement. While the latter has questionable loyalties to socialism he has promised to place them in charge of the economy in return for allowing him to run the political sphere in the power-oriented method he views as necessary."

## Commune of France ##
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."

## Costa Rica ##
POLITICS_RICARDO_JIMENEZ_OREAMUNO_DESC:0 "The son of two-time president Jesús Jiménez Zamora, Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno rose to prominence before the Weltkrieg. In his first term as president between 1910 and 1914, he oversaw the repayment of the country's crippling national debt. By his third stint as president, the country's national debt had again skyrocketed, and again President Jiménez attempted, less successfully than before, to bring Costa Rica back from the brink of default.\nLooking forward, Jiménez fears that without a principled hand to guide it, Costa Rican democracy could be hijacked by foreign economic interests. Perhaps though he wishes to retire from politics, such fears will ensure his continued presence."

## Cuba ##
POLITICS_MANUEL_BISBE_DESC:0 "Among the founders of the Cuban Authentic Party, Manuel Bisbé Alberni and other more moderate members left the organisation shortly before the bloodbath of 1935, and like many other ex-Authentics, joined with the Unionistas. Rumors circulated during the Havana Strike that Bisbé was directly involved with some moderate dissident groups, and while such speculation was never confirmed, Bisbé's appointment to boss of the Unionista Party following Rafael Trejo's retirement was almost certainly motivated his favorability among the dissatisfied."
POLITICS_MARIO_GARCIA_MENOCAL_DESC:0 "President from 1913 to 1921, many Cubans look back on Menocal's time in office with great fondness. Before the scandals of Zayas and the tyranny of Machado, the man remains one of Cuba's most respected heads of state. Following the revolution of 1928 and worried with the nation's political direction, Menocal re-entered politics and was elected to the Cuban senate. There, he and his new National Democratic Association allied with the remenants of the old Liberal Party to oppose, at least ostensibly, the military and Unionistas alike."
POLITICS_RAMON_GRAU_MARTIN_DESC:0 "As a professor at the University of Havana's medical school, Grau with other dissidents within the faculty and student body to resist the rule of Gerardo Machado. While Grau was not directly involved in organizing the mass student protests which catalyzed the revolution of 1928, he and his supporters quickly emerged as a powerful political force in the chaotic time immediately thereafter. A staunch nationalist, he was far from satisfied with the post-revolutionary status quo and while he initially supported the Unionistas in their power struggle against the military, his fervor and ever-increasing disdain for the socialist-bloc led to his utilizing extra-legal means to achieve his goals. In cooperation with army officers disaffected with the leadership of General Diaz, Grau's politically convenient thugs grew into a radical bonafide paramilitary and Grau turned more and more from his democrat ideals, his anger growing with his authoritarianism.\nAmidst the chaos following the election of 1935, Grau, now operating from the countryside where government rule had all but collapsed, hardened into the man he is today; both an idealist and a tyrant, steadfast yet so quick to compromise his beliefs, Ramón Grau San Martín is a walking contradiction."
POLITICS_LAZARO_PENA_DESC:0 "The young Lazaro Peña succeeded Sandalio Junco as boss of the CNOC totally inexperienced. Peña's meteoric rise in the short time since caught many among even Cuba's left off guard. An advocate of complete collectivisation and industrial development, Peña wears the moribund label of 'communist' with pride. Despite this, the CNOC and its leadership both past and present, have both embraced many aspects of European syndicalism and paradoxically call for cultivation of a stronger Cuban national identity in an internationalist context."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GUITERAS_DESC:0 "As leader of the Cuban Socialist Party following the Cuban revolution of 1928, Guiteras was a thorn in the side of Cuba's military kingmakers and instrumental in the survival of the party and socialism in general in Cuba following the events of 1935. Now, as chairman of the broad 'Socialist Movement', successor to the old party, and President of Cuba, Guiteras will undoubtedly be equally involved in shaping the future of the nation. While Guiteras is a relatively orthodox syndicalist, he possesses his own unique ideological quirks which could be crucial to the nation's ultimate fortune."
POLITICS_JUAN_HERNANDEZ_DESC:0 "Often compared to Nicaragua's Sandino, Juan Blas Hernández waged a years-long guerilla war in Cuba's southern hills. He is first and foremost a man of the people, and more than willing to fight and bleed for the sake of the nation's least fortunate. Now in power, President Hernández seeks not only to live up to his grandiose rhetoric, but the larger-than-life reputation he has garnered among many in the Cuban peasantry."
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TREJO_DESC:0 "As a young law student at the University of Havana, Rafael Trejo González grew increasingly disillusioned with the authoritarian regime of Gerardo Machado Morales. He joined the newly founded anti-Machado 'University Student Directory', established along the lines of the defunct 'University Student Federation', as well as the equally disaffected 'Law Students Association'. By late 1927 he had become influential in the former and the President of the latter. Trejo's impassioned yet collected denunciations of Machado and his influence within the university as well as his close association with Socialist disciples of exiled former student leader, Julio Mella McPartland, led to his forced dismissal following pressure from Machado's government. In response, Trejo led demonstrations in Havana and with the support of elements of the Cuban Army, overthrew Machado. Thereafter, Trejo, with the support of the military under the presumption that he would be easily controlled on account of his age, was appointed President instead of his older colleagues within the new caretaker government. Despite becoming President of Cuba just after his 18th Birthday and amidst rising tensions between his more extreme coalition partners, Trejo effectively guided the nation through the tumultuous years that followed his revolution."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "The son of Cuba's second president, José Gómez, Miguel Gómez was first elected to national public office during the Machado era. While he begrudgingly followed the Liberal Party line and lent Machado his support, he was among the most vocal supporters within the legislature of the student demonstrations that toppled the Machado regime. Following the success of the student revolution and the collapse of the Liberal Party, Gómez founded the Republican Party along with other moderate members within the defunct Liberal Party's right-wing. Opposed to undue regulation, Gómez envisions a Cuba enriched by a flourishing financial sector and booming trade with the wider world."
POLITICS_CARLOS_MENDIETA_DESC:0 "Senate President Mendieta succeeded Clemente Vazquez as President of Cuba following the latter's assassination, and Vazquez's shoes have proven hard to fill. Regardless, Mendieta, though calls for reform abound, even from within his own party, attempts to maintain the character of the executive established under his authoritarian predecessor."
POLITICS_JOSE_BARNET_DESC:0 "Following a long and illustrious career as a diplomat, Jose Agrapino Barnet was appointed as President by an outgoing Carlos Mendieta. While many assumed his Presidency would be a fleeting 'lame duck', Barnet approaches his position with a degree of professionalism rarely seen in Cuba's cutthroat political atmosphere."
POLITICS_MARTIN_TAMAYO_DESC:0 "As a junior officer stationed near the Cuban Presidential Palace, Martin Diaz first came to prominence at the head of a contingent of soldiers who joined with the student revolution of 1928. Finding himself at the forefront of a rapidly coalescing faction within the military and granted the rank of General, the merely thirty year old Diaz soon became the most powerful individual in Cuba, even more influential in the nation's politics than the President himself. Now, years later as President in his own right, Diaz stands nearly unopposed as the luminous sun around which Cuban politics orbit."
POLITICS_CLEMENTE_VAZQUEZ_DESC:0 "Clemente Vazquez was among president Machado's closest confidants and the President of the Senate for most of Machado's tenure, and despite many close calls, survived multiple attempts of his life following Machado's downfall. Unlike so many of old Liberal party, Vazquez held fast to the authoritarian model for the presidency established by Machado. Thanks to American brokerage of several informal deals with General Diaz, Vazquez returned to Cuban politics after only a short stint laying-low in the American embassy, and quickly found his feet. As President, Vazquez continues to emulate his older mentor, and many Cubans find his rule to be nearly indistinguishable from that of Machado."
POLITICS_JULIO_MELLA_DESC:0 "Grandson of Dominican hero, Matías Mella, Julio Mella had his first run in with the law as a first year university student during the tenure of president Zayas. As President of the ideologically socialist University Students Federation, Mella attempted to resist the authoritarian regime of Gerado Machado. For this, he was exiled to Mexico for the next eleven years. Upon his return, Mella quickly re-established his position within the Cuban left and brought with him a new ideology known as 'transformationism' influenced by Mexican agrarian socialist strains of thought. As President, Mella seeks to turn Cuba into a model for 'transformationism' for the world, no matter the cost or who may attempt to stand in his way."
POLITICS_CARLOS_CESPEDES_DESC:0 "Carlos de Céspedes, son of the Cuban independence hero of the same name, spent decades in politics and the Cuban diplomatic service. While ostensibly loyal to Machado during that pivotal tyrant's tenure, Céspedes secretly worked to undermine his regime, coordinating closely with other disaffected Liberal party members. Soon after the student revolution, Céspedes returned to elected office with a stint in the Senate, wherein he founded the New Liberal Party to unite like-minded former Liberals who with the dissolution of the Liberal Party lacked any formal association. As president, Céspedes looks to return Cuba to the early days of the Zayas regime, without the alleged corruption of course, and with a consciousness for often overlooked social and political realities."
POLITICS_RAUL_ROA_DESC:0 "Grandson of a decorated Mambí, Raúl Roa first developed his revolutionary socialist ideals as a student activist against the regime of Gerado Machado. Upon his release from prison, he worked closely with extralegal socialist opposition groups and the ideologically mixed 'University Student Directory' at the University of Havana. While not a direct participant of the protests which precipitated Machado's ousting, he found a platform writing for various left-wing publications, gain a good degree of celebrity among Cuban socialists. While Roa was only appointed to the office of the Presidency as part of a compromise between Cuba's feuding socialist factions, he possesses a knack for leadership and public speaking beyond his years."
POLITICS_ALBERTO_BAYO_DESC:0 "Expelled from the Cuban Air corps for pistol-dueling another airman, Alberto Bayo joined the Spanish Legion and fought in that nation's colonial war in northern Morocco. Returning to Cuba in 1932 following the dissolution of the short-lived Spanish Republic, Bayo joined with the rebel Juan Blas, training guerillas to fly whatever small aircraft they managed to capture. Eventually, Bayo relationship with Blas grew to the extent that each man became the other's closest confident. With Blas's untimely 'departure' from the struggle, Bayo took up leadership of those who would still pledge their loyalty to the wider movement Blas had led."
POLITICS_SANDALIO_JUNCO_DESC:0 "A close associate of Julio Mella's and exiled along with him to Mexico in 1925, Junco managed to secretly return to Cuba after the Cuban student revolution and eventually rose to the leadership of the CNOC, which still retained the ideological character it had possessed in 1925. Despite working with other socialist groups out of necessity, Junco disagreed deeply with the ideology and personal character of other socialist leader such as Antonio Guiteras and Juan Blas. Eventually forced to step down from his position as chairman of the CNOC by disaffected younger members, Junco retained a large of degree of influence within the organisation and the 'Comunista' faction of the Cuban Socialist Movement. As President, Junco seeks total collectisation of land and the nation's rapid forced indutrial development."
POLITICS_TINA_MODOTTI_DESC:0 "Noted photographer of Italian origin, Tina Modotti, came to Mexico in 1922 to follow a Mexican lover. Years later, she met and, out of character with her history of moving from one affair to the next, eventually married Cuban exile, Julio Mella. Upon the Cuban socialist revolution, Modotti returned with her new husband to the island, helping to re-establish his political career from the moment her feet first touched Cuban soil. After climbing through the ranks of her husband's government, Modotti succeeded him upon his death, becoming Cuba's first female head of state. She remains committed to her husband's transformationist ideology and authoritarian style of governance."

The king has thus guided Denmark through the Weltkrieg, in which the nation remained neutral and into the interwar, presiding the political shift that composed the rise of the social democrats of Thorvald Stauning in 1924. It is said that the king is sceptical about the prime minister and his party, but that he accepts their position in government in the knowledge that he can use his reserve power should excesses occur.\n\nMany have considered that the fact that this has still not happened after 12 years means that the king eventually accepted the democratic parliamentarism that has been in place since the ascension of the Deuntzer cabinet in 1901."

While in France, his views became increasingly coloured by French orthodox syndicalism, and upon his departure for the Dominican Republic in 1928, he had become a fervent supporter of Emile Pouget\nIn the Dominican Republic, his early efforts to promote syndicalism were mostly ineffective, but he managed to cultivate a small and devoted following, becoming the face of the Syndicalist movement in his adopted country."
POLITICS_PERDRO_HENRIQUEZ_URENA_DESC:0 "While slandered by political opponents for his marriage to the sister of Mexican Syndicalist, Vicente Lombardo Toledano, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, son of former president Francisco Henríquez Carvajal, returned to the Dominican Republic after years abroad to a great degree of fanfare. Despite comparisons to his radical brother-in-law, however, Henríquez is by no means a syndicalist; the principled writer, is however, more than willing to work any across the political spectrum who subscribe to the view that the Dominican Republic, and indeed all of Latin America, should be entirely free of imperialist influence, and able to fully choose their own destiny."
POLITICS_JUAN_JIMENES_GRULLON_DESC:0 "Juan Jimenes Grullón, son of former president Juan Jimenes Pereyra, despite the decline of progressivism in the Dominican Republic during the American occupation, is a true believer of the ideals of his father's Jimenistas. The younger Jimenes entered politics soon after returning to the Dominican Republic in 1929 from Germany, and soon established a small but devoted following."
POLITICS_ESTRELLA_URENA_DESC:0 "Rafael Estrella Ureña, while ideologically a social and economic reformist, gained a great deal of infamy even before the American occupation for his seemingly endless ambition and lust for political power. Since the end of the occupation, Estrella's name has only become further tainted by his willingness to work closely with both the military and members of the nation's economic elite."
POLITICS_MARTINEZ_REYNA_DESC:0 "Virgilio Martínez Reyna was essential to the 1924 election of Horacio Vásquez Lajara as the Dominican Republic's first president since the American Occupation. In his own presidential tenure, he has been equally central to the nation's incessant political turmoil. While popular and far less corrupt than his predecessors, Martínez's failure to quell discontent amongst the nation's economic elite and even begin to address the political power of the Army precipitated the nation's political direction thereafter.\nIdeologically, Martínez draws heavily on a uniquely populous Catholic corporatism, and while indeed not entirely authoritarian, is more than willing to undermine the foundations of Dominican democracy if need be."
POLITICS_MANUEL_CONCHA_DESC:0 "Manuel Troncoso Concha, once a small-time corporate lawyer, came to public prominence through connections to General Rafael Trujillo. Often accused of being little more than a puppet for Trujillo, Troncoso's fate, despite his denial of such accusations, has become inexorably linked to that of the general."

Now in full control of the country as he has so long desired, Trujillo works closely with organized crime to line his pockets and strengthen quell descent. He also seeks to bring the tumultuous western border fully under control and eliminate the threat posed by Haitians there once and for all."

But one, unsinkable truth for the King-Emperor is that the new Dominion is no Raj- it is but just a shaving of the Jewel of the Crown. No longer does the Crown maintain an iron grip on the subcontinent, but a loose alliance with the north- a truth that does not help the demeanour of the King-Emperor in the slightest, and a truth that sits uncomfortably with the Delhi Government, of whom many members wish to break all ties with the King-Emperor and declare home rule. For now, the King-Emperor still rules, but his power is diminished and his roar is now a soft bark."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DELHI_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_CHAMBER_OF_PRINCES_DESC:0 "The Chamber of Princes was originally established by King-Emperor George V during the Weltkrieg to appease the increasingly unruly Indian nobility. The instability and political violence that followed the British revolution necessitated that, to maintain authority, the unelected Chamber was delegated substantial governmental authority, and eventually reorganized into the proper upper-house of the now bi-cameral Indian legislature. Upon the death of the viceroy of India, the Chamber is responsible for appointing a successor."
POLITICS_GANGA_SINGH_DESC:0 "Ganga Singh, prince of Bikaner, proved a capable military leader during the Weltkrieg, eventually becoming the only Indian member of the British Imperial War Cabinet. Not just a military man however, Singh proved to be an astute politician, gaining a substantial following by advocating sweeping yet gradual reform of India's convoluted political system. In his push for reform however, Singh maintained cordiality with the British administration, and gained the admiration of sympathetic aristocrats. Due to his popularity, Singh's support was crucial for then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, in transforming India from an appendage of the British Empire into an independent Dominion."
POLITICS_BHIMRAO_RAMJI_AMBEDKAR_DESC:0 "Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, despite being born into the Dalit caste, was recognized as a prodigious student, and earned his place as a student of the most prestigious western universities.

He seeks to promote the social standing of the Dalits without destroying India's social and political order."
POLITICS_RATANJI_DADABHOY_TATA_DESC:0 "Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, son of perhaps India's most famous industrialist, after whom Jehangir is named, fled his native Paris during the Weltkrieg, shortly before Germany captured the city. Upon arrival in Delhi, Jehangir's father fell increasingly ill, and Jehangir assumed control of the Tata business empire. Jehangir personally financed counter-insurgency operations in the wake of the break-up of the Raj, and in the process, became increasingly involved in Dominion politics, eventually being appointed as chief of the Indian national bank."
POLITICS_ATUL_CHANDRA_CHATTERJEE_DESC:0 "Atul Chandra Chatterjee, diplomat and moderate labor activist, served diligently in the British Raj's 'Indian Civil Service'; he was the British High Commissioner to India when the British Revolution struck, and upended India's political system. His efforts were pivotal to the establishment of the Dominion's foreign service, even personally managing most of his nation's diplomats when issues arose. Following Viceroy Ganga Singh's appointment, Chatterjee became even more prominent in India politics, even striking up a friendship with Singh. Chatterjee has been a vocal advocate of state protection of the rights of India's industrial laborers."
POLITICS_SRINIVASA_SASTRI_DESC:0 "Srinivasa Sastri, who founded the Indian Liberal Party after leaving the Indian National Congress, is renowned for negotiating a degree of autonomy for India shortly before the British Revolution. Sastri, though once nearly incarcerated for his association with the Indian Home Rule League, and not opposed to India's recent declaration of a republic, is quite an anglophile; he believes that the institutions established by the British should be maintained."
POLITICS_MINOCHER_MASANI_DESC:0 "Minocher Rustom Masani, a vocal proponent of classical liberalism, split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's drift towards socialism. Masani is a charismatic and good-natured man, who, despite policy disagreements, maintains personal friendships with many political rivals, even those of the Indian National Congress. Minocher similarly enjoys even the most mundane of political decision, often speaking for hours on end on the floor of parliament on the minutia of financial decisions and administrative budgets. Minocher's attention to detail and gregarious nature has won him a large political following."
POLITICS_NARASIMHA_KELKAR_DESC:0 "Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's increasingly socialist stance. Shortly before the disintegration of the British Raj, Kelkar, and other more liberal Congress defectors founded the Swaraj (meaning independence or self-governance) Party to promote parliamentarian democracy in India. Kelkar is not only a man of politics, however; he is an accomplished playwright, and his works have been responsible for igniting increased national identity and political consciousness among the people of India."

In his time as President, he managed to approve an economic plan by the Ecuadorian banker Victor Emilio Strada, which has slowly but steadily improved the economic situation of Ecuador.

Apparently, He has other plans for the Salvadorian democracy, ones that differed greatly from the PL and the PND. Seeing the Red Menace looming over Central America, Castro took advantage of the government's refusal to crack down on rebellious military elements and secretly allied with them, waiting for the Laboristas to make a wrong move to take over El Salvador.

Public outraged ensued after his election, with plenty of media outlets considering his rule as a pseudo-monarchy which came to be known as the Meléndez-Quiñones Dynasty. Despite the bad press though, his rule saw the greatest coffee boom ever registered in El Salvador's history, making the nation reach record levels of economic prosperity and catapulting Molina's popularity to new heights. However, many episodes of repression during his rule had severely damaged his reputation and was forced to step down when his term was over. The hardships El Salvador has been forced to endure in his absense have made many miss the times of prosperity that he brought, and with a lack of any other strong liberal candidates, the PND decided to contact Molina once again to lead the liberal coalition, to which Molina has gladly accepted. Now that he's back in power, he has promised to do anything in his power to deliver prosperity back to the Salvadorian nation and its people."

The Laboristas won the 1931 election, and Araujo's career seemed to have practically skyrocketed overnight. However, economic hardship, social instability and opposing the interests of the army and the rural oligarchy only weakened Araujo's position further and further. His presidency came to an end when his Vice-President and Minister of War, Maximiliano Hernandez Martínez made a successful coup d'etat in December 2nd, 1931, sidelining Araujo from any politically relevant position and ending democracy in El Salvador. However, with the Second Western Rebellion being successful and Araujo having been chosen to lead his country for the transition to a full democracy once again, he has become a beloved figure in El Salvador, and his rule is bound to see progressive reforms and welfare be introduced to the nation."

However, with time, Martí grew further and further apart from Sandino, with them disagreeing more and more often on the fate of their countries should their revolutions succeed.

The second son of Karl I, Roberto grew up in Austria alongside the royal family, and despite having learned Italian, seldom thought about his duties as head of the house of Austria-Este for most of his life. But now, he is Duke, and few can argue that his position isnt exactly enviable, as recovering the land ravaged by Syndicalism while having to deal with a brand new political landscape, having essentially no political experience, is quite the dauting task."

While he technically acted as a regent for his demented brothers, Elias has been long the de-facto head of the house, and his ascension to the throne of the now restored throne is little more than a fait-accompli of dynastic politics.

Inaugurated not by coronation, but by swearing an oath on the constitution, Adelbert, who also converted to Catholicism to align himself with his nation's populace, has long sought the respect, if not admiration, of his people. Years of oppression under the German regime and a tendency for Adelbert to cling on to a more absolutist type of monarchy than the Belgian system have led to great anti-German sentiment among the populace, making Adelbert despised and hated amongst the common folk."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the king who trounced the invading Germans at the Yzer, has returned to Belgium from exile in Canada. When his motorcade entered Brussels for the first time since the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, church bells across the nation rang, and many Belgians weeped with joy. German collaborators and syndicalists, however, lament the restored king, and plot to undermine the new Belgian government. Albert must now mend the deep wounds which have marred Belgium, and create a renewed sense of hope among its people."

His father died when he was very young, and he was forced to move to Argentina with his brother when he was just thirteen years old. Already as a teenager, he was exposed to the anarchist ideals by the people he met while he travelled with the 'Serrano-Mendoza' traveling theater company. He participated in a strike of trade employees in Trelew, Chubut province, that turned into an open rebellion, with him fighting alongside the strikers. Although the revolt was crushed, he gained valuable experience for his future uprising.\n\nWhen the second Patagonic strike came about, after wealthy landlords decided to ignore the requests that had been agreed between the strikers and the government, he decided to join up with the strikers and organize their insurrection. The strike led up to a stand-off at the 'La Anita' farm, where Soto rallied the disillusioned workers with a fiery speech and managed to hold back an army detachment lead by Lieutenant Colonel Varela. His forces began growing with simple workers who wanted better working conditions and eager idealists alike, and would later join up Alfredo Fonte's forces in 1923 in the events that lead to the creation of the FOP. 'El Gallego' has become a legendary figure for the workers in the FOP and anarchists worldwide, and he'll strive to bring the anarchist ideals of justice and equality into Argentinean society, in a peaceful way if possible and in a violent way if necessary."

He assisted Philosophy and Sociology courses and began following Jean Jaurés after the US's intervention of Cuba in 1894, where he began manifesting his hatred towards imperialism. He joined up a group of young writers in Argentina and they all affiliated the Partido Socialista. However, the Partido Socialista's conservative leadership by Juan B. Justo quickly antagonized the young group, which formed its own more combative faction within the PS.\n\nWhen the FOP broke off, Ugarte couldn't stand Justo's inaction, and decided to leave towards the newly-born nation. While Ugarte has shown devotion to the revolutionary ideals, he also has many differences with his fellow revolutionaries. He staunchly defends freedom of religion and the concept of nations, reaffirming his love for the Argentinean nation and culture. However, he also believes in joining forces with other socialists in order to stop imperialism into South America, and as such, he'll strive to unite America under his banner."

Finding her new ideals now clashing with her life, she decided to go to the FOP with her husband. Her trip was long and hard, and they barely managed to cross the Rio Negro as the Argentinean Border Guard closed in on them. An FOP's border guard patrol that was passing by intervened, and Fanny survived the subsequent skirmish.\n\nSince then, she has joined up the border guard of the FOP in order to help other revolutionaries escape to the FOP and help protect it from reactionary aggression. She became an active member of the force, participating in plenty of border skirmishes between 1934 and 1936, which have granted her a lot of experience and popularity amongst the FOP's populace.

However, during the second Patagonian strike, his ruthlessness shined through, as he demanded the strikers to surrender unconditionally, even executing the messengers Soto sent to reach an agreement. However, he failed to contain the uprising, and his failure gained him a demotion in the army. However, since then he has worked closely with the Liga Patriotica, gaining valuable experience in anti-insurgency tactics, and now that he's military governor of the Patagonia, he will rule with an iron fist and hunt down those who once dared to humiliate him"

He met up with Micaela Feldman de Echebéhère during those years, who taught him military strategy, and turned the brigand into a proper general. In 1923, he met up with Soto in Paso Ibañez, as the Patagonian uprising was growing out of control, where they both agreed to work together and settle their differences. Soto would lead the FOP, but Fonte would lead its armies, in one of the events that marked the creation of the FOP.

While the role of leading the newly founded Republic of Goyaz is an unpleasant one, especially with the powerful Caiado family jostling for power constantly, Leonidas certainly believes that cooperation, at least for now, is the best way to ensure the prosperity of his home."
POLITICS_RAMIRO_NORONHA_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "While a relatively low ranking officer before the beginning of hostilities, Ramiro Noronha has since established himself as one of the most well known service men in the lands now controlled by Goyaz. As to seek a quick pacification of the hinterlands, his expertise as many times garrison leader and interventor in the region is now at the service of the newly founded republic, in a role that he certainly did not predict when he enrolled into military service as a young man. Now having to deal with grumbling oligarchs and syndicalist protests, Noronha himself fears he may no be entirely qualified to the task laid before him, but is determined to establish order first, before any reconsidering of strategic options."
POLITICS_JARI_GOMES_GOY_DESC:0 "Born in 1913 in the riverine city of Corumbá, Jari Gomes graduated in medical school, but has been more active as a poet and politician since then. After following the all to familiar climb of city councillor, state and then federal representative, Jari is one of the most influential politicians in what is now the Goyaz Republic, and has been chosen as it's first president, in a move some claim is a direct attempt to curtail the influence of the Caiado family in regional politics. The stage is set for a new chapter in the ever changing landscape of this land's politics, and few can predict if President Jari will come out on top internally, but his foreign backing certainly has most oppositors moving cautiously."
POLITICS_TOTO_CAIADO_DESC:0 "The recent political history of the state, and then the Republic of Goyaz is almost entirely the history of the extremely wealthy and powerful Caiado family, and those few and brave enough to oppose their immense political power. Even as it transitioned into an independent nation, Antônio José Caiado, also known as Totó, is by far the most powerful man in the land, as the head of the family and all its properties and influence. While some could call dealing with foreign occupiers dubious, there are few things the family would not do to maintain its grip on local politics, which has admittedly weakened ever since the democratic reforms in the wake of the interstate war. Now assuming direct control of government and with powerful foreign backers, few can even see a future where the Caiados don't rule Goyaz."
POLITICS_CANDIDO_RONDON_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "Almost a living legend in Goyaz's northern reaches, and all of the former Brazilian lands as a whole, Candido Rondon is a die hard republican who spent decades of effort to connect, explore and map the large western reaches of Brazil. Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon knows these lands better than any man ever has in history, and he will not give up the fight for his republican values, even in the dire situation all of former Brazil finds itself in. Some, however, claim him to be broken and tired man, that gave up his fighting spirit for the safety of the people in the region."
POLITICS_CHICO_AQUINO_GOY_DESC:0 "His Revered Excellency Francisco de Aquino Correia was born in 1885 in Cuiabá, and is the chief religious authority and intellectual in the region. Having dabbled in politics since 1917, Francisco knows that the role of the church in the hinterlands is more than a spiritual one, but one of guidance and guard against the ever present threats of the material world, such as the temptation of atheism and discrimination. While he was at a point had something of a common cause with integralists in Brazil, his relative lack of enthusiasm for the monarchist movement caused him to fall into the wayside of that movement, but has since admitted that dealing with those radicals was a mistake borne of fears of a rise in syndicalism. While he is respected among both the people and his peers, he will have much to endeavour in stabilizing the newly established republic, especially when it comes to curbing the ever growing influence of the Caiado family of the capital."
POLITICS_PEDRO_LUDOVICO_GOY_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Goyaz, Pedro Ludovico Teixeira completed his studies in Rio de Janeiro before returning to his home, where quickly began a political career, positioning himself against the state oligarchs, the Caiado family. While initially left leaning politically, the failures of the ED and the street violence that even reached his city during the 1936 elections have drifted him towards a more liberal-democratic point of view. His main goal while at the helm of the republic is one that has defined his political career, his long standing desire for a better and more developed Goyaz, even if his ideas on how to reach said goal have changed quite a bit over the years. As he now takes the helm of an independent and free Goyaz, he can finally set his development plans into motion, and while some powerful families will likely stand in his way, naturally including the Caiado, he has confidence that his foreign backing gives him a secure position to negotiate."
POLITICS_PONCE_ARRUDA_GOY_DESC:0 "A civil engineer by trade, João Ponce de Arruda is not exactly the kind of man who typically takes on the protagonist role in socialist states. While he always was a left winger, he never saw himself as a radical, but as a moderate, and this position and his influence in the region have allowed himself to present himself as the best possible head for a transitional government as the newly established republic gets back on its feet, as the war demolished what little infrastructure remained. Born in Cuiabá in 1904, he also both blood and friendship ties to many of the states notables, and seeks to ensure a stable transition; but many of the powerful families in the region still believe themselves in a position above the new government, which is bound to cause issues for the young nation."
POLITICS_APOLLONIO_GOY_DESC:0 "Apolônio de Carvalho is one of the most notable military servicemen to have joined political life in the left wing, having had a long and distinguished career in the Brazilian military after he left his home in Corumbá to serve. He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. With the war that devastated the former nation now in the past, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left-leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country must be done in a swift and decisive fashion, and not doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the newborn republic. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army. As a military man, he also believes in a proactive foreign policy to safeguard the interests of world revolution."
POLITICS_HEITOR_LIMA_GOY_DESC:0 "Heitor Ferreira Lima was born in the city of Corumbá in Mato Grosso, but he moved to Rio de Janeiro while still relatively young, in 1922. He started working as a tailor and joined the local syndicalist movements, and became one of the three youngsters chosen there to study in Paris under the auspices of the Third Internationale. There he turned into a true scholar of economic and social theory, and has since dedicated his life for the workers of the world. Now tasked with the role of leading his birthplace to a better future, he has to face off not only against the elements, but the quasi-feudal resistance against any kind of modernization efforts that is well entrenched within the newly formed state. However, the internationalist nature of the man means he will not hesitate to call in foreign help to deal with any open unrest, a fact the wisest members of the opposition to the communard government recently established have to always keep in mind."

POLITICS_BARATA_AMA_DESC:0 "Joaquim de Magalhães Cardoso Barata was born in 1888 in Belem, and has served with distinction in the Brazilian army for decades. He is however more well known for his multiple tenures as an administrator in the state, as he is the leader of the local military faction in that state that supported São Paulo in the interstate war. His tenures were usually stable, even during election year he often found himself at odds with other major political factions and actions, such as his main rivals in the Sodré family, who accused Barata of voter fraud on multiple occasions, but the political union with Amazonas and other northern states should give him some more room to maneuver. As president of Pará, Barata is also commander-in-chief, and his influence with the newly formed military should not be underestimated, for he has taken a close attention to the formation of this military force. Having for so long struggled to maintain political control of the region, Barata now finally has Pará marching under the beat of his drum."
POLITICS_LAURO_SODRE_HOS_AMA_DESC:0 "Lauro Nina Sodré e Silva had left political behind him after the interstate war, but the current situation of Pará as an independent nation brought him back to the forefront, this time as its head of state, not merely as its governor. Born in Belém in 1858, the old man is more than just a powerful and veteran politician, but also perhaps the oldest active politician in Pará. Also a military man, like many of the leaderships in Brazil during the times of the old republic, he took part in the Vaccine Revolt in Rio, being arrested in the process, and after that, continued his career as a multiple time representative for his state in that city. While his years may be running out, he is preparing the new republic's political system to stay aligned with his family and allies, while also balancing foreign demands and repairing wartime damage to the vital portuary infrastructure across the states he now rules over."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_FACIOLA_AMA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Antônio de Almeida Facióla's political career all the way back in the 1880s, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot in the grave'' is dangerous for Parense democracy, the multiple times state president of Pará political power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. While he wields significant clout at his former political arena, the ''old man president'' doesn't really have a strong degree of influence in Amazonas or the smaller territories, and may find himself having issues actually ruling the nation's disparate political factions; as his position as it's first president is to a great degree based on foreign appointment rather than his own efforts."
POLITICS_ALVARO_BOTELHO_MAIA_AMA_DESC:0 "Born on the edge of Rio Madeira in the outskirts of the city of Humaitá, Álvaro Botelho Maia moved while still young the provincial capital of Manaus to finish his studies, and quickly found himself involved in local newspapers and later followed on into politics, but he is also a poet and a writer in his free time. While his career so far has been a string of relative unimportant appointed positions in smaller territories of the defunct Brazilian government, his growing frustration of his lack of power to properly reform the northern reaches of the country was immense even before the war, and now he sees himself in a prime position to modernize Grão Pará's still young economy, education and political infrastructure. However, being both a reformer and not of a traditional political family puts him in a collision course with powerful landowners and rubber barons, and he will have to spend significant effort to see these changes through even with foreign backing."
POLITICS_EFIGENIO_SALE_AMAS_DESC:0 "Hailing from the town of Serro in Minas Gerais, Efigênio Ferreira de Salles was at the helm of the state of Amazonas at the start of the interstate war, and when the news of the war reached the north, he opted for a 'wait and see' stance, which resulted in him being ousted from office after the rebels successfully ousted president Bernardes on that occasion; since then, he occupied relatively minor positions as a representative and worked as a teacher, his primary job for much of his life. However, the result of the war Brazil found itself in has made his political destiny take another unexpected turn, as he is now the president and head of state of the newly founded republic of Grão Pará, a position both powerful and precarious, as his influence in Belém and outside of Amazonas in general is severely limited, especially after so many years out of the upper echelon of the great game. However, his experience, allies in Manaos and foreign backing almost ensure that in any contentious matters, his voice will be the last one heard and the one truly heeded in the young republic."
POLITICS_LANDRY_SALES_AMA_DESC:0 "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances in detriment of militarism political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. While he is not a native to the lands of the north, he spent most of the past decade occupying administratie posts in Pará, and thus has chosen it as his hope for the time being, while also fostering good relations with the republic of his birthplace to the west. He has a big task ahead of him, as the already diminutive amount of infrastructure of these riverlands may take decades to repair, but Landry is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."
POLITICS_AMA_POMAR_DESC:0 "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar lived certainly an unorthodox childhood, having moved to New York from his home state of Pará while aged 5, living there for two years before returning to his small birth time of Obidos, and then moving to the state capital of Belem. He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publically, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age; now, he is faced with the immense challenge of leading a nation that is just as young as him, and faces immense hurdles of infrastructure and budget. While these concerns are certainly worrisome, he believes that with the support of the people, socialism can flourish even here, in the banks of the Amazon basin."
POLITICS_CLAUDIO_SANTORO_AMA_DESC:0 "Claudio Franco de Sá Santoro was born in Manaus in 1919, and is an extremely renowned musician and composer. His career in music began while still young, but his involvement with the Internationale is just as old, as he often found his colleagues involved with syndicalist and leftist organizations even from very early. His appointment to the position of first head of state of his new country is a recognition of his career in both of those fields, but also an immense responsibility, as the riverine republic has to repair the immense wartime damage, both administrative and in infrastructure, while also dealing with the powerful and avaricious landowners who see Claudio as a foreign collaborator, and will stop at nothing to keep the people ignorant and to ransack of the world's greatest forest of its riches. Dealing with these opponents may well be a complicated matter for the young socialist, who is still seen as excessively hopeful and naive, and perhaps may require foreign intervention."
POLITICS_AMA_JOAO_AMAZONAS_DESC:0 "Born in Belém in 1919, João Amazonas de Souza Pedroso's involvement with politics and the socialist movement began relatively recently, in 1932, during one of the first actions of the newly founded Democratic Left in his hometown. While initially a social democrat, as the years went by he drifted further left, frustrated with the power the landowners had over democratic institutions and growing more and more cynical of the capacity of democracy to bring real change to his home. Now, he is in a position to do much more after the liberation of Brazil, as the head of state and chairman of his homeland, and bring the modern age to Pará as a whole; and this time, it's the landowners who are at the mercy of the proletariat, and not the other way around. In due time, he hopes, the lands around the river he was named for will become known as a shining example of socialist success and prosperity."

POLITICS_OSVALDO_LIMA_GRP_DESC:0 "Osvaldo Cavalcanti da Costa Lima Filho was born in the town of Cabo de Santo Agostinho, is a young and energetic right wing radical and former member of the AIB. His political career began as early as 1936, where he partook in the street battles in Recife against syndicalist rabbles, and has since become one of the key agitators of Integralist ideology in the region. While he, like many integralists in the northeastern part of Brazil, never held any significant monarchist beliefs, the movement enjoyed his support as he saw the republic as little more than a failed experiment in its current state. Being a law graduate, Osvaldo wishes to re-establish the rule of law cross the Confederation; and to do so, he prepares an extensive plan of investigations and arrests against traitors and terrorists, some of whom have roamed the nation freely for decades. To this end, he is organizing a reformed secret police department, backed by the remnants of integralist militias, whose members still remember their faith and duty to God, and will not hesitate to carry out this regrettable yet necessary task to establish peace in the newly founded republic."
POLITICS_GOIS_NRD_DESC:0 "Born in the town São Luís do Quitunde, Alagoas, in 1889, Pedro Aurélio de Góis Monteiro is a member of an influential family of military servicemen who occupied powerful positions in the old order's army. His army career began in the school of war in Porto Alegre, and he relatively quickly climbed the ranks of the military in Brazil. His position politically has always been marked by legalism, and his brother Cícero Augusto died in combat the Interstate War. But he also is defined by a strong bias against syndicalist and socialist views, which he saw as the primary threat to civilization as a whole across the world. While his position as leader of the Confederation is none one he picked himself, he is determined to establish the rule of law by any means necessary, and he enjoys widespread support for this endeavour in the recently organized national army, as the military in the region has traditionally shifted towards the right wing. The main issue while he is president however will be the many differing powerful political factions and oligarchs that have traditionally wielded power in each individual states; these coroneis will stop at nothing to increase their influence, even if this damages the overall goals of self sustainability and army reform the president defends."
POLITICS_WHITECASTLE_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco was born in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceará, in 1897, and completed his military studies in Porto Alegre, in the far south. He occupied the post of a military instructor in Rio during the Interstate War, and sided with the rebels like many other mutinous officers. Being on the winning side brought him many political advantages, and by 1936 he was an army major and one of the most influential servicemen in the nation. His most standout political belief is the strong opposition to any kind of syndicalist or socialist principles, and he always defended open war against any kind of internationalist regime as necessary to maintain peace and order. To him, syndicalists are enemies of freedom no matter what treaties they sign, and they seek to undermine the values of the nation as a way to replace them with the beliefs of Marx. This disposition might have had him in friendly terms with the AIB, were it not for his relatively strong republican beliefs. Now as the appointed president of the newly formed federation, the most pressing matters of rebuilding the administrative and transport infrastructure must at least for now take precedence over the enforcement of his planned anti-socialist and anti-union legislation."
POLITICS_COFFEE_JR_GRP_DESC:0 "Born in Natal in 1899, João Fernandes Campos Café Filho performed as a young man the typical path of Brazilian politics, working on journalism and studying law before managing a spot in local legislatures, but with the key difference of having played football professionally for Alecrim FC during the waning years of the Weltkrieg. Having positioned himself strongly in favour of the opposition in the interstate war, Café holds a strong belief in modernizing the country, but also in demoratic principles he often found were seldom respected by his peers in the old brazilian legislatures. A presbyterian protestant, Cafe Filho is a part of a minority in the intensely catholic Guararapes, but despite what foreign observers might infer, it's an extremely secondary matter, for his biggest issue when taking the rulership of the federation will be the local elites, the coroneis, whose influence and wealth made them historical political kingmakers in the region. He, however, counts as his ally the extremely influential João Pessoa, and has significant, even if broad, popular support for his democratic and liberal ideals."
POLITICS_CAVALCANTI_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "While born in the small town of Palmeira dos Índios, Newton de Andrade Cavalcanti moved away from home quite young to pursue a military career, and he was quite successful in it. A distinguished and talented officer, he had already become a high ranking officer by the time of the interstate war, and by that point was an army major and one of the most respected servicemen nationwide. His respected position and political moderation compared to most high ranking officers made him a natural choice for leader of the federation, as the war left a wake of lawlessness, anarchy and damaged infrastructure that may take decades to repair without intense foreign aid, something that doesn't seem quite likely. His republican beliefs frequently put him at odds with some radical integralist officers; while he today denies any ties with the movement, he did have some slight sympathy for their actions against syndicalist movements, even if not for their monarchism. While he usually distanced himself from political stations, he is now the guardian of democracy in the region, as the coroneis, disgruntled integralists and the ever looming syndicalists all threaten the fragile federal order in the states of Guararapes."
POLITICS_JOAO_PESSOA_GRP_DESC:0 "João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque is perhaps the most powerful man in all of the states that forms Guararapes, his career, popularity and political clout all almost unparalleled. Having led what is considered by many to be the most successful presidential term in the history of Brazil's republic, being multiple times state president of Parahyba and led the state governors of the region as a bloc for a decade. Born in the small town of Umbuzeiro, João later moved to several different major cities, having graduated in law in the University of Recife, and lived for times in places such as Rio. He rapidly climbed the political ladder, and soon rose to the prominent position is is now widely known for. His immense credibility is why he leads the confederation; while legally could not be president of Brazil again after his term, this is an entirely different entity, and he hopes to stabilize the newly founded republic, but also secure its prosperity and repair the extensive wartime damage across the country; but he will have to face stiff opposition from coroneis and other oligarchs across the nation, even if most state presidents of the federation are his allies."
POLITICS_JOSE_AMERICO_DE_ALMEIDA_GRP_DESC:0 "José Americo de Almeida was born in the small town of Areia, Parahyba, in 1887, and became a public prosecutor in the city of Souza, in that same state, shortly after graduating from law school, and became state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the administration his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While his appointment as head of state may be seen as surprising, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire union of Guararapes, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_RACHEL_QUEIROZ_GRP_DESC:0 "Perhaps better known for her activities as an author, journalist, teacher and translator, Rachel de Queiroz mostly represents the interests of her unions than that of any established political movement in the modern post revolutionary landscape, as she never had a very deep connection with leftist cliques. Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the newly founded socialist congress, with the backing of several cearense delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialization programs, or building huge railways across the nation."
POLITICS_CRIS_CORDEIRO_GRP_DESC:0 "Hailing from the small town of Limoeiro, Cristiano Cordeiro started his career in public services early, working at the state treasury while still a law student at the University of Recife. A veteran of the syndicalist movement in Brazil, Cristiano was one of the founding members of the PSB, and worked in organizing strikes both big and small in Recife for decades, while also acting in defense of the workers as a city councillor and other minor legislative positions. While he himself always positioned himself against a revolution enforced by military means, he nevertheless is the greatest syndicalist leadership in the states that form the federation, and thus was selected by it's unions as it's first chairman, while also receiving support from foreign syndicalists. His key policies are centred against combating hunger and extreme poverty that have devastated the states of the north ever since colonial times, but he also holds stances in favour of defending the rights and lands of the native peoples, who were the primary victims of the feudalistic practices of the local powerful landowners, the coroneis."
POLITICS_DJALMA_GRP_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the liberation and break-up of the states, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Guararapes's new, socialist government. His main goal is to improve the living standards of the people of this historically poverty-stricken land, especially those of the peasantry, who's ever growing vulnerability to droughts and food shortages caused mass migrations throughout the last four decades. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."

With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol.

POLITICS_PHAM_VAN_DONG_DESC:0 "In 1924, Pham Van Dong travelled to southern China. There, he met Ho Chi Minh, and quickly became one of his most trusted confidants and leaders of men. He witnessed the tragic end of Vietnamese syndicalist movement and fled to France. In exile, he developed an interest in the ideology of French Jacobins, Vanguardism. The idea of a vanguard group of disciplined intellectuals leading the revolution captured him. After the split of the League in 1931, he founded Tan Viet party and started infiltrating the colony. Most of his colleagues find him forever diligent and energetic, a reliable and loveable person as well as an ideal organiser and administrator. On the other hand, his enemy fear his ability to run the party and state machine."
POLITICS_TA_THU_THAO_DESC:0 "This young radical almost shouldn't have been the chairman of the prestigious Indochinese Revolutionary League, but he is and he is well respected by his colleagues. Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity. The recovery of the League from the collapse largely credited to his efforts. Now, he is determined to achieve the unfulfilled dream of the martyrs——build syndicalism in Indochina."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_AN_NINH_DESC:0 "Nguyen An Ninh is respected by most Indochinese intellectuals as the true democratic soul of Indochina. He studied in Sorbonne and participated the French Revolution in 1919. In 1922, Nguyen An Ninh, Nguyen The Truyen and Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh) met in Marseille and decided to plan the liberation of their motherland. Nguyen An Ninh returned to Indochina in 1924 and was arrested by German police for radical agitation. After witness the crackdown of Indochinese syndicalism, Nguyen An Ninh decided that Indochinese revolution must rely on the spontaneous uprising of peasants. Since then, he started the Aspiration Society, modelling on traditional secret societies. He often personally travels from village to village under the disguise of a monk or herbist, selling his self-made ointment, and secretly recruit members to sow the seeds of revolution. He thus won great popularity among peasants in the Mekong Delta. While his dream of complete transforming the personality of Indochinese people might not realise in the foreseeable future, his emphasis on cultural enlightenment, autonomy and spontaneity will deeply reshape Indochinese society."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_TAI_HOC_DESC:0 "Nguyen Tai Hoc is the founding leader of the Viet Nam Quo Dan Dang, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. He was a supporter of colonial reformism, but later disappointed at the empty promises of the colonial regime and became the leader of revolutionary nationalism. Although the Yen-Bai mutiny failed, his successful escape from German police after that tragedy adds another chapter in his heroic deeds. Influenced by Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, he envisages a democratic republic truly for people's welfare."

POLITICS_SUKARNO_DESC:0 "The son of Javanese aristocrats, the young Sukarno came into the world in 1901. Sukarno first become interested in politics when he was introduced to unique philosophy of a farmer named Marhaen. Marhaen's personal political philosophy inspired Sukarno to found the PNI in 1926. Sukarno's other great influence being the Algemeene Studieclub, which studied Dutch translations of the German constitution to form their basis of elected rule. Now that independence is here, Sukarno is beholden to the many faiths and desperate ideologies of Insulindia to unify all people in the peninsula."
POLITICS_TAN_MALAKA_DESC:0 "Tan Malaka has always walked a tight rope between orthodox and heterodox beliefs. In religion, Tan's support of Sarekat Islam, an egalitarian Islamist organisation, contrasted against the hierarchy of religious leadership. His commitment towards socialist thought also contrasted against the prevailing trade unionism that was growing in Europe. Between the lines Tan has pushed cooperation towards a brighter future."
POLITICS_SUTAN_DESC:0 "A student of Amsterdam University during the fierce debates of the late 1920s, Sutan's observations turned him away from revolutionary socialism and towards the economic theories of cooperative socialism. Upon his return to Indonesia, he attempted to join the PNI. Issues with the self-sufficiency message expressed by Sukarno led to him exit from the party. In defiance of the ban on socialist parties imposed by the Dutch, Sutan created the PSI under his own very loose definition of socialism."
POLITICS_HASHIM_ASYARI_DESC:0 "Long before the world was shaken by war, Hasyim's was destroyed while he was unaware. During his Hajj, his wife and child in Java had dead. Upon his return he saw both the apathy of Muslim authorities and the oppression of the Dutch as intolerable. Hasyim used this anger to ascend through the NU to transform the relationship between Islamic teachers and their students from directional to mutual."
POLITICS_MUNAWAR_MUSSO_DESC:0 "Musso was one of the leaders of the revolutionaries in 1925, a revolution inspired by the British one which was swiftly crushed by the colonial authorities and eventually resulted in the destruction of the PKI, forcing Musso to flee to the People's Republic of Bengal, from where he got into touch with Totalist thinkers from Europe. Convinced by the revolutionary ideas of this new movement, Musso hosted a reading and translation of the Totalist Charter among Insulindian exiles in Calcutta, subsequently forming the Partai Totalis Insulindia (PTI) that was to be the successor of the PKI. This definitively alienated Tan Malaka and his followers as the PTI rejected collaboration with Muslims towards independence, setting the stage for a permanent split in Insulindian socialism."
POLITICS_SEMAUN_DESC:0 "While many other Insulindian independence leaders avoided deportation by the Dutch, a group of vocal trade unionists lead by Semaun were caught trying to organize a trade union meeting in Surabaya and deported to the Legation Cities. From this exile Semaun grew in power by drawing attention to the miserable working conditions in factories. As his trade union was becoming more and more popular with Malayan immigrants, distance support from Sarekat Islam dried up. The mantle to uphold trade unionism was picked up by agents of the Third internationale, who assisted Semaun in founding the PVI. Now, Semaun's dramatic return has brought new issues that integrating with a political left that distrusts him."
POLITICS_WESTERLING_DESC:0 "Out of all the nations for Westerling to land in, Insulindia was his last choice, although he had adopted Islam at a young age, his relations with Sarekat Islam and leftism couldn't be worse. His unit in Insulindia was both famous and infamous for their discipline and lack of emotions in carrying out their tasks. In the utter chaos of strife that engulfed the nation. Westerling emerged as a very much foreign influence within the nation of many foreigners. That has given Westerling an sort of outsider edge that allowed him to crawl to the top of the heap."

He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
POLITICS_FRANK_MACDERMOT_DESC:0 "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
POLITICS_GEAROID_O_CUINNEAGAIN_DESC:0 "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveler settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."

Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."
POLITICS_DE_VALERA_DESC:0 "Eamon de Valera, born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and taken to Ireland at the age of two, was a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, however ending up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty, having expelled Michael Collins from the Sinn Féin party despite Collins' incredible popularity, and then left SF himself later due to the influx of ex-Labourites into the party after the 1923 ban of the Labour Party as well as disputes with nationalists preferring a pro-German alignment which were in contrast with de Valera's belief in isolationism and neutrality. His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."

POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Perhaps it was cruel fate that Saud bin Abdulaziz incurred the wrath of an Emir named Abdulaziz ibn Saud. Saud bin Abdulaziz was no stranger to strange and terrible events. The young Emir's crowning at age ten a machination of the Al Sabhan family, his maternal family. He witnessed as a young man the death of famous British Explorer William Shakespeare without ever realizing the humor in his name, or that his death would leave the Rashids with no allies during the Weltkrieg. Despite squabbling, the loss of the Rashid army to British maxim guns and a betrayal by his cousin, the Rashid family survived. A head on his shoulders allowed him to secure a protection deal with the Emir of Kuwait, the leader of the Howietat, and an unsteady peace with Nejd. Now this Emir is grown and ready to lead Arabia through the violence and betrayal towards a brighter future."
POLITICS_ABDULAZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Born to a naïve Saud bin Abdulaziz aged only 20. Abdulaziz bin Saud did not know the harsh tent his father grew up in. when Abdulaziz's time came for military service, he chose instead to travel. On his personal pilgrimage on a horse with no name, he observed the changing world of warfare in Egypt and Constantinople. He returned to Ha'il not in a tawb, but in a fashionable black uniform ordered from Germany. Now that Saud bin Abdulaziz is dead, his son has determined to avenge his family and end the Saud feud once and for all."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus, it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon receiving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' wellbeing. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early successes paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in his speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal reputation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his reputation can save him from the machinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one-time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was successful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the Turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along the 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah.

POLITICS_BAKR_SIDIQI_DESC:0 "Unlike many Kurds that joined the Ottoman Army's special Hamidiye units, Bakr Sidqi joined the general army alongside Arabs in after training in Istanbul. This slot allowed him to gain allies within the Ottoman command throughout the Weltkrieg. After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the Kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî is the leader and patriarch of the Berzincî clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mehmûd himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mehmûd has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the Kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mistefa Barzanî in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the failure of the Russian socialist revolution that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî, Mistefa was only five when his family was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mistefa first became involved in his brother Ehmedê's milita in the 1920's. Ehmedê's militia attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ehmedê's capture and execution. Mistefa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mistefa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanî tribal laws. Officially Mistefa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."
POLITICS_SHEIKH_SAID_DESC:0 "Follwoing the end of the Ottoman Caliphate during the War in the Sands, many Kurds formerly belonging to the Hamidiye were discharged without pay. Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti-secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."
POLITICS_RIZA_DERSHIMI_DESC:0 "Karuman is a member of what had been a Ottoman loyalist family. The Bedirxans had ruled Bohtan for a century leading up to their independence activities. Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

Though refusing to sign an oath of personal loyalty to Sun Yat-Sen after his refounding of the KMT, Wang would later become a member and a prominent official in the Guangdong government. Aligning himself with the growing left-radical factions of the KMT and the army’s ‘New Guard’, Wang outmaneuvered Hu Hanmin in 1925 to become Sun Yat-Sen’s successor.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Northern Expedition and the German Intervention shattered the Guangdong Government. Wang and the other radicals were immediately attacked by Sun Fo and other moderates for the failures of the expedition, but his control over party positions and personal alliances prevented his deposition.\nWang survives to this day by these factors, but he is highly aware that his future leadership rests on what happens in the next attempt at revolution.\n\nIn terms of personality, Wang Jingwei is a flamboyant, blustery character who is a natural orator. His penchant for wearing military uniforms when acting in a position as Commander-In-Chief makes many of his opponents see him as megalomaniacal, but he usually lets actual officers take the lead when it comes to military decisions. His insistence at maintaining an alliance with the Syndicalist powers is only surpassed by his desire to avoid another intervention by Germany or Japan at all costs until China is unified and ready to fight them."
POLITICS_CHI_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "The eldest son of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, Sun Fo has been a constant presence within the Kuomintang, though not always a prominent or powerful one. While respected because of his father, Sun Fo is not a charismatic or exceptional person himself. The centrist factions in the KMT that have come to be represented by him rely on his familial name and his 'iron neck' to keep their criticisms of the Minsheng program represented within the party's discourse. With control of the Nationalist Government returned to its moderate factions, Sun Fo is in the unenviable position of both having to reconcile with non-syndicalist powers while scaling back the social aspects of the National Revolution."
POLITICS_CHI_CHEN_DUXIU_DESC:0 "Chen Duxiu is an odd figure in the Kuomintang, as he is both an insider and outside to the party itself. While a member of the KMT, Chen is also the chairman of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, a heretofore minor player even within the syndicalist politics of urban China. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. A prominent intellectual and Xinhai- era revolutionary, Chen's anti-traditionalist bent and background in Marxist theory colors his views of the future development of China."

After the German Intervention, Hu's distrust of the dominant civilian factions and close friendship with Dai Chunfeng led him to resent the politically-motivated meddling by the Left KMT's leadership in matters of war. Hu's ties to both the NRA and the ZhongTeJu made him a critical figure in the growth of the bureau and the later success of Dai's coup against the civilian government. Because of his political indispensability and loyalty, Hu was appointed as Acting President for the duration of the \"state of emergency\" that Dai Chunfeng and the ZhongTeJu now govern through. While not an especially charismatic or skilled politican, he and Dai are close friends and his prominence ensures that the army maintains loyalty to the current regime."

The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. Fang is a dogmatic and charismatic leader who acts as an shaky bridge between the growing radical syndicalist movement and the order established by the KMT."

POLITICS_GXC_CHEN_JIONGMING_DESC:0 "A unique case among the warlords of China, Chen Jiongming was a lawyer and elected official before the Xinhai Revolution. As a member of the brief Guangdong Provincial Assembly, formed in 1909, Chen quickly made a name for himself as a successful and enthusiastic, albeit radical, reformer, with his republican and anti-Qing leanings being an open secret to local officials.\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution began in 1911, Chen, as a member of the Revolutionary Alliance, became commander of the Guangdong Army and was instrumental in helping Sun Yat-sen of the KMT set up the Constitutional Protection Movement. However, the two men developed a fierce rivalry, having very different opinions on the future of China, which boiled over in 1922 when Chen revolted against Sun. Chen would be forced to surrender and flee after Sun's ships indiscriminately bombarded Guangzhou. The KMT's Central Committee never forgave Chen for his \"betrayal\", ensuring severe tension between the two most prominent republican movements in China.\nChen Jiongming returned to Guangdong after the failure of the Northern Expedition, which he had predicted, and he was quickly asked to become governor of the province once more. Through unprecedented cuts in military spending, Chen was not only able to rebuilt the province, devastated by a decade and a half of conflict, but make it one of the most prosperous despite the German's dubious concessions in the provincial capital.\nAs governor of Guangdong, Chen has been able to put his ideals into practice. He is one of the very few genuine believers of democracy and federalism and that successfully implementing them in his \"Model Province\" will lead to the rest of China following suit, seeing the clear benefits of self-rule and genuine democracy."

His division would participate in the failed Northern Expedition in 1926, with the Fourth Army decimated by the German intervention force. After a brief exile in Hong Kong, Chen returned to Guangdong, where he would reorganise the KMT remnants in the province under the auspice of Governor Chen Jiongming. With these remnants, he founded his own party, the Productive People's Party (ostensibly little more than a KMT front), participating in the province's burgeoning provincial democracy, supporting a shaky alliance with the Governor despite the latter being widely seen as a traitor by the KMT.\nChen Mingshu would prove to be an able politician, maintaining the KMT's presence in the southern province and ties with Soong Qingling's faction of the Party. However, he remains distrusting of Wang Jingwei's Central Committee, critical of their exile in France and their lack of commitment towards Minquan, or democracy according to Sun's Three Principles."

As a British national, he worked as a Comprador for the HSBC, managing his own silk farm as well. After successfully speculating during and after the Shanghai Financial Crisis of 1910, he became one of the most influential businessman in the South.\nThe Xinhai Revolution and the chaotic first years led to poor social and financial security, and the Guangzhou Merchants' Public Safety Organization, or Merchant Corps, was founded to remedy the situation and Chen would lead it. The Merchant Corps would ensure stability in the city through the Republican era and, later, increasing expropriation and mismanagement from the KMT rebels.\nChen Lianbo's Merchant Corps rose up against the KMT in 1924 in an attempt to overthrow them, but failed, and the remnants would flee to Hong Kong, where they would ally with Chen Jiongming's Federalists to preserve Guangdong's stability and autonomy.\nThe Merchant Corps, after the failure of the Northern Expedition, would work with both the Germans in Guangzhou and Chen Jiongming's provincial government, ensuring a Chinese presence and protection from both German encroachment in the city and increasingly radical reforms in Guangdong.

Gathering a significant force as Yunnan retreated, he aligned himself with the KMT forces and established the New Guangxi Clique after evicting the Old Clique from the province.\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Li’s skilled leadership of the Nationalist Seventh Army earned it the moniker of "Army of Steel", being one of the few NRA commanders to have defeated Wu Peifu on the field. However, the Expedition failed, and Li was forced to retreat to Guangxi, where he would be dislodged by a combined Old Guangxi-Guangdong force aligned with the Zhili Clique. The New Guangxi Clique then fled to Yunnan, protected by Tang Jiyao in order to safeguard his province's autonomy.\nAfter his defeat, Li Zongren focused on rebuilding his forces and consolidating, rapidly becoming the informal leader of the KMT's right-wing.

He was merely an upstart member of the Provincial Assembly, having only been part of an aborted attempt at an uprising before the Xinhai Revolution. When Guangdong declared its independence in October 1911, Chen was elected the commander-in-chief of its forces, the Xunjun, an army of defected army officers, peasants, and revolutionaries. He would lead this revolutionary army and free Guangdong, forcing the Governor-General to flee Guangzhou before joining up with Sun Yat-sen's forces. Under Sun, Chen was known as cautious, perhaps overly so, but competent. When Sun returned in 1917, Chen would be the one to drive Guangxi forces out of Guangdong in a couple of months when Sun split with Lu Rongting. Chen repeatedly advised caution over the Northern Expedition, which, along with intrigue from other Kuomintang officers, further drove Sun and Chen apart until they split in June 1922. In 1925, Chen would return to lead the Guangdong Army against the KMT, but would be defeated and forced into exile. The Kuomintang was then defeated by the Zhili with German help, making Chen's earlier caution rather prophetic as he returned to a Guangdong sapped of its wealth.

Omar's loyalists left Sharif to tend to the casualties of war, these victims would later remember Sharif's dedication to survival, and elected him leader of the Republic. Sharif has renewed his dedication to the Libyan people, and lamented that Omar could have been a greater leader if he cooperated with the wider world."
POLITICS_HUSSEIN_MAZIQ_DESC:0 "Born at the tail end of the Italian occupation, Hussein Maziq was the son of a patriotic resistance fighter in Benghazi. Maziq's family submitted to the Senussi order when Idris reclaimed the land from the Italians, and were put in touch with the legendary commander Omar Mukhtar. Maziq covertly supported Idris in exile, and simultaneously educated himself in Italian and French to work with industrialists. When the Second Weltkrieg came to Tripolitania, his organisation helped people evacuate to Algiers. Now this reputation has become known, and the grateful people of Libya have elected him President."
POLITICS_ABU_MENIAR_DESC:0 "Among the Qadhadhfa, very few would have expected an illiterate Bedouin to rise in the alien ideology of socialism. But when the Italians were occupying Qasr Abu Hadi, the illiterate Abu Meniar bought schoolbooks in Italian. His journey towards literacy in Italian continued after their army retreated, and his fascination with changes happening in Europe led him to move his family to Tripoli in 1923. Tripoli being the centre for Italian expats, Abu Meniar began reading Il Popolo d'Italia. Mussolinis strive for the unity of Italian people to overcome poverty led Meinar to ingratiate himself with the right people. Upon the rightful succession of the Internationale, Abu Meinar became their most trusted associate."

POLITICS_SKIRPA_DESC:0 "Kazys Škirpa's life is quite colourful to an outsider. He was one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army in 1918, and soon worked his way to Major General, but he was quick to realise that there will be no free and independent Lithuania under the German thumb. Škirpa and a number of minor disgruntled officers formed the Iron Wolf Organisation, a National Populist paramilitary fighting against German rule and the Slavic minorities within the Kingdom, as well as the Party of Lithuanian Interests as the movement's political arm. And now, he is in charge, under the Lithuanian equivalent title of the Romanian Conducator or Russian Vozhd - Tautos Vadas."
POLITICS_MINDAUGAS_III_DESC:0 "Born as Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III ascended to the throne of Lithuania after his father's death in 1929, and has ruled this Baltic nation since. Even though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, it's unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him. And Karl Gero is as much of a foreigner to them. It's hard to say if Mindaugas III would survive even a day on the throne without the Kaiser backing him from the shadows."
POLITICS_KAZIMIERAS_II_DESC:0 "A Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat from Kretinga, Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, now Kazimieras II, has committed the greatest sin possible in the eyes of the common Lithuanian - selling out to the Russians and giving up his nation's sovereignty to return the country under the hated eastern tyrant. This event has tainted his image to his people forever, and even though Tiškevičius is a capable administrator, a bright mind and even feels some compassion for the people he rules, his rule over Lithuania is tenuous at best."

As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

Growing up in a confluence of Han and Hui influence in Gansu, Ma Lin allied himself with the Xidaotang Hanafi muslim sect. Ma Lin often served as a mediating influence in the first two decades of the 20th century to the more radical Ma family members, including Ma Zhongying. Ma Lin was able to repulse Ma Zhongying's raids in Gansu during the Ma-Guominjun war. Ma Lin succeeded his brother, Ma Qi, as Governor of Qinghai following his death in 1931. This appointment greatly displeased his nephew, Ma Bufang, who voiced his own qualificationns for Governorship. Ma Lin's work as Governor saw the expansion of Qinghai into Amdo in 1935, garnering praise from the Ma families.

POLITICS_STERNBERG_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventually anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913 he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as and officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence. \n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a 2 month prison stint following attacking another officer in a drunken rage, in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently against the communists. Ungern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Ji. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent. \n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. When the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was brought to Urga in 1933, Ungern promised he would rule as regent until the boy came of age. However, with Ungern’s grip dependent on his russian military clique, there are fears he will keep the power for himself."

In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Rebellion, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Yazgurtan Survaljtan, seized power.

There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Rebellion, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardīn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."
POLITICS_7TH_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Born Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu is an extremely important figure in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu’s were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Rebellion, the Buddyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."
POLITICS_JAMSRANGIIN_TSEVEEN_DESC:0 "A central figure in Mongolian politics, Jamsrangiin Tseveen was born in Transbaikal during the Russian Empire. He went to a Buryat private school in St. Petersburg, and eventually began visiting Buryat tribes in Irkutsk. In 1902, he became an auditor at St. Petersburg University. While there, he went on many research trips across Transbaikal and Outher Mongolia. After a few years he began to teach Mongolian Language there, and also visited Inner Mongolia and Ordos. When the Bogd Khaanate became independent in 1911, Tseveen supervisied a secular Russian school there and was editor for two newspapers, the Shine toli and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig.\n\nAfter Mongolia was occupied by Xu Shuzheng in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at Irkutsk University. He also travelled around the area and met with many discontent Mongolias, who eventually founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam. At their founding congress in 1921, Tseveen wrote the Ten Aspirations, the party’s platform. Following their failed revolution in 1921, Tseveen went into hiding in Transbaikal, helping continue to organise the MAN. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Tseveen helped rally Buryat rebels in joining the MAN rebels in once again trying to overthrow Unger-Sternberg. After this failure and the death of their leader, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the MAN went back into hiding. Since then, Tseveen has travelled across the more empty regions of Mongolia, educating the people and conducting research.\n\nFollowing the Western Rebellion and the MAN takeover, Tseveen began to see the problems in the party. Over the years he grew more disillusioned with the more radical elements of the party, and saw it as corrupt. Following a power struggle in the party, Tseveen created the Mongol Libyeral Nam, as an opposition to the MAN."
POLITICS_SOLIIN_DANZAN_DESC:0 "As a young man, revolutionary Soliin Danzan was a living as a horse thief, poor and struggle to survive. He lived like this for many years, until he went to Urga to work as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919, he, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar formed the nationalist group Züün Khüree, which later merged with the Konsulyn Denj group, led by Dogsomyn Bodoo. For a few years after this, the MAN worked with Russian bolsheviks in trying to take over Mongolia. This culminated in the 1921 revolution against Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, which barely failed. Danzan went into hiding after this, as did the rest of the MAN. Danzan was one of the key organisers of the 1924 revolution, another failed mission which led to the death of Sükhbaatar. Following a dangerous power struggle with Dambym Chagdarjav and Dogsomyn Bodoo, Danzan became chairman of the party, once again in hiding. For the years since, Danzan helped push the MAN to a more nationalistic and less bolshevik group, completely disavowing from the failed bolsheviks from Russia.\n\nAfter the Western Rebellion in 1936, Soliin Danzan and the MAN were able to seize power, finally allowing him to implement his policies. However, there are still many threats to his rule. The party is still very split, with power hungry members ready to strike. Also, the introduction of democracy, though something the party promises, could be a threat to the party’s rule."

After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Rebellion, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Yazgurtan Survaljtan, failed to seize power, and he and the aristocrats faced much descrimination from the now empowered peasant Arats. Now, following Ünenbayan making Demchugdongrub Head of State, the Popular Prince finally has a chance to realise his Pan-Mongol dream."

He had never expected to see mutiny from his own ranks, never expected to see the red flag rising on top of fair Paris, and he had never expected to flee from France in a beat-up old steamboat to Algiers. The French National State is less than a shadow of the glory of the Republic of France that stood before, but something still lived in the hearts of the Marshal and all of those that lived in this France, and that was the insatiable desire for revenge and a return to their homeland.

POLITICS_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "Sandino's emergence as a minor guerilla leader fighting in the 1926 Liberal Revolution was completely unexpected, with his presence not really being noted until the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, which he disagreed with. Beginning with a small guerrilla force of 300 fighting in the south, he intensely fought in the jungles, slowly weakening the United States Marines. However, he kept being pushed further and further south until he was forced to leave his force with Francisco Sequeira Moreno and retreat to Mexico. There, he met with socialist leaders such as Zapata and became known in the international community. He also became a member of the EMECU, a spiritualist organisation which believed in the founding of a universal commune under god. Returning to Nicaragua in 1931 with Zapata coming along, many rallied to his side and his forces grew bigger than ever, until he and his men managed to liberate Managua in January of 1932, forcing the United States to retreat. Now slowly gaining a mass following, his presidency is loved by many with some even going as far as to create groups in his name to promote him and his rule."
POLITICS_FRANCISCO_SEQUEIRA_MORENO_DESC:0 "Francisco Sequeira Moreno was born into a poor family like much of the families of Nicaragua, and has spent the majority of his life illiterate. Following the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro between the 'Liberal' revolutionaries and the United States, he emerged as a guerrilla leader fighting within the north of Nicaragua. Him and his regiment of 400 men killed many, but were forced to retreat south and fight on with Sandino. While Sandino was in Mexico, he bravely fought in in the south against the United States occupation until Sandino returned, and became one of the leaders in the push northward and the eventual liberation of Managua. Once the revolution ended, he ended up forming his own party known as the 'Partido Campesino de Nicaragua', focused on rights for the lower class and improving the education system. While also learning how to read starting in 1932(Something he still struggles with), he is an adored individual among many of the Nicaraguan lower class."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa was Vice-President of former president Carlos José Solórzano until he was overthrown in a coup by former president Emiliano Chamorro Vargas. After Adolfo Díaz rebelled, he was sworn in as president by Liberal revolutionaries in the south led by José María Moncada Tapia and assisted in the liberation of Managua. However, after the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, he stepped down as president due to his disliking of United States influence and went back to exile in Mexico. Serving mainly as an observer in Sandino's revolution, he decided to return to Nicaragua around the same time as Sandino and was present for the liberation of Managua. With him and Sandino finding themselves agreeing on basic principles, Sacasa was able to form his own party known as the 'Partido de la Revolución Liberal'. Mainly supported by those who prefer traditional democracy compared to Socialist and the small higher class, he has surprisingly managed to gain a decent base of support and some dedicated followers of his cause."
POLITICS_ELILIANO_CHAMORRO_VARGAS_DESC:0 "Serving as President from 1917-1921, Vargas is a military man with an extremely controversial reputation. Initially supported by the United States in his first presidency and helping to negotiate a treaty that allowed the United States to build a canal through Nicaragua. His presidency was largely looked over besides succeeding to pay off a significannot portion of Nicaragua's debts. However, despite his efforts, he failed to win the presidency in 1923. Following the 1926 election of Carlos José Solórzano, he couped the government, setting off the chain of events that led to Sandino's government. For this, some credit him as the beginning of the revolution while others discredit him as power hungry. All that matters now however is that his dream of returning to the presidency has finally come true."
POLITICS_ADOLFO_DIAZ_DESC:0 "Adolfo Díaz has been one of the main targets of a smear campaign from Sandino, and for not entirely wrong reasons. Helping put down liberal president José Santos Zelaya in 1910, he was sworn in as president with much help from the United States. Leading the presidency first from 1911-1917, he was the definition of an American puppet furthering the goals of American companies like the Tonopah Mining Company. In 1914, he suffered a liberal revolt which one part in many long years of the 30 year long US military occupation, with marines being forced to suppress the revolt. These marines stayed in Nicaragua for over a decade to keep order while also giving the US permission to build a Nicaraguan canal. However, after Chamarro's coup in 1926, the 2nd Marine occupation force swore him in as president. His attempts to suppress unrest failed, and he was forced to concede for new president José María Moncada. Ever since he lived in the US, until now. A foreign force has occupied the country, and he is once again needed to suppress the unrest that plagues the region."
POLITICS_ANASTASIO_SOMOZA_GARCIA_DESC:0 "Somoza started a humble life in Nicaragua like many others, gaining the rare opportunity to go to business school in Philadelphia, and there he married his future wife Salvadora Debayle Sacasa, niece of Juan Bautista Sacasa. From there he was able to work his way up the ladder until the liberal revolution in 1926. Unremarkable overall in battle, his real attention getter was his excellent English from America itself, working as the broker of peace between the liberal rebels and Americans. From there he managed to get further relations with the Americans, joining the newly formed Guardia Nacional until just before the expulsion of the Americans, he was named head of the organisation. However, once Sandino reached the capital, he was forced to retreat to Honduras who accepted him and the leftover of the Guardia with open arms. To his dismay, Juan Bautista Sacasa due to joining the Sandino regime forced his wife to divorce him. Wishing to reclaim his homeland and his wife, he has finally succeeded in his goals."

Known to be a strong proponent of Democracy, the prince only accepted the throne after he was legitimised by plebiscite, adopting the regnal name Haakon that had been used by the Norwegian kings of old.\n\nIn more recent years, Norway's perceived support for the entente during the Weltkrieg has pushed it into diplomatic and economic isolation, resulting in an increased growth of the socialist movement. Despite being respected and supported by the Norwegian people, and his declaration in 1928 that he is also the king of the syndicalists, this republican movement renders Haakon's position all but secure."
POLITICS_Vidkun_Quisling_DESC:0 "Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling was born on July 18, 1887 in Fyresdal. Son of a pastor of the Church of Norway, Vidkun Quisling began his career in the General Staff of the Norwegian Army, then traveled throughout Europe in the 1920s. During this period, he contributed to several humanitarian projects, but was horrified by the syndicalist revolutions which erupted over all over Western Europe. Returning home to Norway, he saw the rising popularity of socialist parties. Determined to prevent his beloved country from falling into the hands of the Reds, he founded the Nasjonal Samling in 1933, a populist nationalist organization which split into two factions, a reactionary one more favorable to the monarchy and a populist one calling for Germanic morality and replacing the decadent monarchy with Quisling as the Fører. After the Socialists' victory in the 1936 election, Quisling was compelled to intervene to save Norway. Now wielding the power necessary to restore Greater Norway, Quisling and his people look forward to a radiant future."

Following the Peace with Honor in 1921, the young Said bin Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur bin Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said bin Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Trucial coast and the Ibadi tribesman in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said bin Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that opresses Dhofar."

## Palestine ##
POLITICS_RAGHIB_DESC:0 "The rival of the Husayni family for decades, Raghib was a student of Istanbul University until the end of the Weltkrieg. Upon returning to Jerusalem, he saw that the Husayni family's aim for an independent Palestine was based on a conflicting promises and antisemitism. Although he himself was Muslim, he believed that the prevailing Palestinian nationalism would be hijacked by a foreign power. Thus, Raghib established his own branch of the Watani party in Jerusalem to counter this movement and the Husayni ambition."
POLITICS_AWNI_DESC:0 "A member of the Al Fatat since before the Great War, Awni assisted in the relief efforts in the Jordan Valley during the Officers Revolt of 1918. While other groups in the Jerusalem Vilyet rallied in the streets, Awni ensured that Yildirim never uncovered the Al Fatat members in Palestine. Now Awni finds himself in control of a vastly unprepared nation that barely knew of his work in the struggle for independence."
POLITICS_MUSA_AL_ALAMI_DESC:0 "Musa Al Alami was the son of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Faidi al-Alami. His upbringing in Jerusalem where Jewish and Muslim converge geve him an appreciation for a government that expedites trade and promotes economic prosperity. The waning power of the Ottomans made his continued allegiance to them impractical to these goals, so in 1926 Musa established Al-tanmiat to prepare cooperation with Zionist groups. Non-aggression agreements were honoured, and subsequent votes propelled Musa into office."
POLITICS_MUFTI_DESC:0 "The son of Jerusalem's mufti and a mortal enemy of the Nashashibi clan, Amin was always quick to deal. The Husayni family's ongoing anti-Zionist position was on the decline until Abraham Antebi was arrested by the Turks. Then sentiment began to turn in Amin's favour. Through deal making in Syria, Amin was able to provide homes for survivors of the 1918 Officers Revolt. The return of Antebi proved to be another boon, as the Yildirim that accompanied Antebi began a campaign to destroy all political dissident in Palestine. Arabs in Palestine flocked to Amin, and he continued to make deals on their behalf all the way into office."
POLITICS_ANTEBI_DESC:0 "Albert Antebi spent the first 40 years of his life trying to mediate the Muslim Jewish divide in the Jerusalem Vilyet. When the Jewish Colonisation Association told him to buy land in Jerusalem for Jewish settlements, he always paid the Arab landowners a fair price. His goal of a peaceful creation of Israel was destroyed when he joined Mustafa Kemal in the Caucasus. After nearly dying in an Istanbul prison, Antebi was released as a bargaining chip of the Yildirm Army Group. He was given the ceremonial title of General Governor of Palestine, the first Jew to be honoured by the Ottomans in centuries, and held in Turkish custody as a virtual prisoner."
POLITICS_HILUPAL_DESC:0 "Radwan became General Secretary of the Palestine Arab Workers Society after the Third Internationale voted for and funded it's reestablishment. Before this, the PAWS was in severe danger of bankruptcy in Jerusalem, as the Yildirim had seized their assets following the return of Antebi. Radwan has suggested to the Internationale that the Yildirim would crumble without Antebi if he were to disappear. This became unnecessary as he died along with the Yildirim Officers in the liberation of the Near East."

Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is no where near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."

POLITICS_OSCAR_BENAVIDES_LARREA_DESC:0 "Oscar Raimundo Benavides Larrea was born in 1876 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated military school in 1906 and was sent to France to take part in their manoeuvring exercises. On his return to Perú in 1910, he became involved in the 'Campaña del Caqueta', which allowed him to climb through the ranks until becoming Chief of Staff in 1913. In 1914 he joined the coup against President Billinghurst, becoming provisional president until 1915, where he called for elections after securing stability. He was then sent to Europe as an observer during the Weltkrieg, but resigned his post when Leguía couped the democratic government.\n\nLeguía was quick to react to Benavidez return, imprisoning him and sending him along with other political prisoners to exile. However, Benavidez managed to organize a successful mutiny in the ship that transported them, escaping to Central America, where he'd support Sanchez Cerro's uprising and later taking an important role in Sanchez Cerro's government.\n\nWith Sanchez Cerro's death, Benavidez took advantage of the anarchy that ensued and became Cerro's successor, suspending elections and becoming Perú's new Caudillo. Benavides has adopted the motto 'Order, Peace and Work', rewarding generously displays of loyalty and punishing severely any display of dissent..."
POLITICS_VILLARAN_DESC:0 "Manuel Vicente Villarán Godoy was born in 1873 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated with a PhD in jurisprudence in 1895 from the 'Universidad San Marcos'. He became a teacher in that same university and would return to his educative role many times during his political career. He was named Minster of Justice, Cult and Instruction during President Leguía's first regime, and would become an active member of Peruvian politics until Leguia's coup in 1919. He was chosen as Principal for the San Marcos University, but rejected his position in protest of Leguia's takeover, and began writing three Manifestos, all of them praising the youthful fighting spirit of his students and warning of the danger that entailed having a Caudillo leading Perú. He was exiled in 1925, but would return in 1927, trying to stay away from politics. During Sanchez Cerro's government, he took part in the subsequent constitutional reforms, although he didn't defend some points that the new constitution brought up. Now that he's president of Perú, he'll take a pragmatic approach to the issues Perú faces, trying to compromise with the UR and focusing on investing in better services and education for the nation."
POLITICS_JOSE_DE_LA_RIVA_DESC:0 "Jose de la Riva Agüero y Osma was born in 1885 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article criticizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal successor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú"
POLITICS_EGUIGUREN_DESC:0 "Luis Antonio Eguiguren was born in 1887 in the small town of Piura, Perú. He graduated as bachelor in literature and jurisprudence in 1913 and in Political Science and Administration in 1914. In 1930 he became the Mayor of Lima, but resigned a year later after discrepancies regarding the autonomy of the city's Instruction ministry, and his differences regarding Benavides's Autocratic rule. He left to Ecuador in a self-imposed exile after death-threats towards his family from radical UR members, only to return after Benavides gave signs of wanting to restore democracy to Perú, where the contacts he had gained him a place in the Partido Socialdemocrata. Now that he's President of Perú, he'll do his best to bring peacefully a welfare-system into Perú, trying to compromise with the APRA and the other democratic parties wherever possible."
POLITICS_UGARTECHE_DESC:0 "Jorge Prado Ugarteche was born was born in 1887 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Son of Mariano Ignacio Prado, who was President of Perú twice in his life, Jorge studied in Law in the 'Universidad de San Marcos' from 1904 to 1909, and then joined the military academy after graduating, becoming lieutenant by 1914. He joined with his brothers to the Partido Civil in 1914, where they helped in the coup d’état that overthrew President Billinghurst. He would later become deputy for the Dos de Mayo province, but would be exiled with his brothers for opposing Leguia's regime.\n\nAfter the assassination of Sanchez Cerro, Benavides, who was a childhood friend of Jorge, recalled him from exile in order to help him in his rule. Jorge began a reform to free political prisoners and recall political exiles that were punished by Sanchez Cerro and Leguia's regimes. However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hardline policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers. Now that Jorge has managed to become President, his belief in the free-market and pro-entente leanings will surely lead to a liberalisation of the Peruvian economy, ushering in a new era of economic prosperity to the nation."
POLITICS_CONSEJO_NACIONAL_DESC:0 "With Agüero's death, the Union Revolucionaria has been thrown into chaos. Factionalism has begun to crack the once unified UR, with many within it vying for power, most notably Luis Alberto Flores Medina, General Ureta Montehermoso and Carlos Miró-Quesada. As long as there's not an elected successor for Agüero, the council will lead Perú forward, albeit with plenty of internal difficulties, until this issue is resolved."
POLITICS_HAYA_TORRE_DESC:0 "Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre was born in the town of Trujillo, La Libertad department, Peru. He signed up for 'Facultad de Letras de la Universidad de Trujillo' when he finished high-school, but would later decide to study to become a Lawyer in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in Lima. There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_CHURATA_DESC:0 "Gamaliel Churata, whose real name is Arturo Pablo Peralta Miranda, was born in 1897 in Puno, Perú. Churata formed several culturalist groups in his youth, through which he met Manuel González Prada, Raul Haya de la Torre, and most importantly, José Carlos Mariategui, who would become a close friend of Churata. He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution. Now that Churata leads Perú, he'll focus on restoring the Andinean cultural identity and purge the Spanish-descendant bourgeoisie from the government, bringing about a new culture and society for the now new country of Piruw."
POLITICS_GONZALEA_PRADA_DESC:0 "Julio Alfredo González de Prada y Verneuil was born in 1891 in Paris, France. The son of known Peruvian anarchist Manuel González Prada, he'd graduate from the 'Universidad San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature in 1910, and would later graduate as a bachelor in Jurisprudence, later achieving a PhD on said career. In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in its more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to suppress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú. A staunch believer of Anarchism, now that Prada is in power, he will focus on bringing about his father's vision for a descentralized and free Perú."
POLITICS_MIRO_QUESADA_DESC:0 "Carlos Miró-Quesada Laos was born in 1903 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated as a Lawyer in Lima in 1932 and joined the Union Revolucionaria. His diplomatic ways with other members and professional handling of propaganda for the party made him quickly rise through the ranks, becoming one of the possible successors to Agüero. Now that Miró-Quesada is in power, he's bound to continue the status-quo Agüero created and keep working forward for Agüero's vision of a glorious Hispanic Perú."
POLITICS_FLORES_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto Flores Medina was born in 1899 in the small town of Ayabaca, Perú. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in the late 1910's. He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his rejection of all races outside of the Spanish-descendant Criollos is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the local native and Asian population..."

He graduated as an artillery second lieutenant from the Escuela Militar de Chorrillos in 1913. After beginning studies in the Escuela Superior de Guerra, he'd be sent to Italy and France to perfect his ability as an artillery officer. A decorated officer, he joined the UR due to his ultra-conservative views and admiration for Agüero, even if they both had their differences. Now that Ureta leads the UR and Perú, he'll try to instill in the Peruvian society at large the patriotism and discipline he was taught as a cadet."

He graduated the Escuela Militar as an infantry second lieutenant, where his grades were so high that he was granted an honorary sword, and named instructor for the school. He continued perfecting his military ability throughout his career, taking an important role in the war against Ecuador, but he never truly prepared to be a politician. As such, now that he's in power, he'll seek to restore the Peruvian democracy, but not before restoring stability to the country and enacting laws to prevent future Caudillismo. However, his rejection of the native population may cause trouble with the large Quechua-speaking minorities in the country...."
POLITICS_BUSTIOS_DESC:0 "Reynaldo Chukiwanka Ayulo Choquehuanca, better known by his regnal name, Pachacutec II, was born in 1914 in Lampa, Puno Province, Perú. The son of Francisco Chukiwanka Ayulo and considered one of the descendants of the Incan emperor, Huayna Capac, he has taken advantage of his father's popularity to rally the Indians to his cause. His father graduated as a lawyer in 1908 from the 'Universidad de Arequipa' and would go to Puno, Perú, where he began fighting for better rights for natives and created an alphabet in which natives could write Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, helping the native population to improve its literacy rates as these languages conflicted with the latin alphabet. Reynaldo became involved in French émigré circles and was influenced by the writings of Charles Maurras. Seeing the government mistreating the native populations, Reynaldo took over his father's institutions and began going from village to village rallying the natives for an insurrection to finally be free of the Criollo oppression."

Competition between Austria and Germany for influence in Poland, both during and since the Weltkrieg, has left the regency council unable to perform its principle duty, the selection of a new monarch. The, so called, 'eternal regency' lords indecisively over a Poland which remains much the same as it was before the Weltkrieg - poor and restless."
POLITICS_ROMAN_DWOWSKI_DESC:0 "Roman Dmowski was a thorn in the side of Germany throughout the Weltkrieg. While many Polish nationalists embraced the Germans as liberators, Dmowski, wary of Germany's assimilation of Poles in its east, favoured the Entente. His Polish National Committee was recognized by the Entente as the legitimate government of Poland during the Weltkrieg. With German victory, Dmowkski was forced to agitate tactfully and in secret; now as head of state, Dmowski is poised to seek renewed Polish national glory."

Following the war, Sikorski cemented his control of the newly established Polish military, and planned for a day when he could lead Poland into true independence. Now, it seems, that day has come; Sikorski has assumed control of the apparatus of the Polish state, and declared an end to foreign dominance."
POLITICS_POL_SEJM_DESC:0 "The Sejm is the lower house of the parliament of Poland. Historically, the Sejm was an assembly of clergy and nobility which, uniquely, elected the king of Poland. With no current head of state, the Sejm acts collectively as Poland's executive."

POLITICS_FRYDERYK_KRYSTIAN_SASKI_DESC:0 "Fryderyk Krystian Saski, born Friedrich Christian von Wettin, king of Saxony, has ascended to the Polish throne. Fryderyk Krystian's status as both king of a constituent state of the German Empire and Poland is alarming to many Poles, who think him subservient to the Kaiser. Subservient or not, Fryderyk Krystian's coronation does indicate increased German influence in Poland."

Despite this, Mindaugas has now also been crowned king of Poland, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_AUGUSTYN_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, though not a descendant of any historical Polish monarch, has been enthroned as its new king.

While some observers fear a return to traditionalism, the new Qing government seems to push for a much more modern style of rule. Puyi himself still lacks much power, but this is of his own design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislature and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, it seems strong, and many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can lead the nation into this brave new world."
POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED__YIGUANDAO_DESC:0 "While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Coup would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honored Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews.

Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 he rose to dominate the clique, leading it to victory over its main rival, the Fengian clique, in 1928, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Manchu monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the Manchu and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of government. A token opposition was allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nWu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim.\nWas once renowned for hang a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck.

Following the collapse of Yuan’s ‘Empire’, he began working with Wu Peifu, becoming a close confidant and assisting him in defeating the Fengtian clique in 1928.

When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu.

There are two theories for this unique monicker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, ralling his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and sieze the bastion. Furthermore, he apparenty even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal."

A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile."

Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attaches that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armored warfare and mechanization, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie.

Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organizing the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilizing the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence. His ties to Japan kept him from being promoted too highly within the Zhili command structure, but following the reforms enacted by Wu in the wake of the LEP collapse he has been promoted to the high command."

In 1917, Guo Jiyu entered the Qinghe Army's First Preparatory Officer School. Two years later, he was assigned to the First Division of the Frontier Defence Artillery Corps and the Northwest Frontier Defence Second Mixed Brigade. In 1921, Guo transferred to the Baoding Army Military Academy, and graduated with full honors in 1923. There, he became involved with the Zhili clique, though his young aged prevented rapid promotion. He became allies with Liu Menggeng during this period as well, and with Liu being chosen to spearhead his national defence plan, Guo was promoted to full General status.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA secretary once told a visiting author an anecdote about Guo's hectic work ethic: '... (At his table) there are four or five telephones as well as telegrams and official documents. Guo went to work every morning at 8:00 A.M., retired in the afternoon to go home to eat two meals, then returned, and worked furiously until 11:00 in the evening, holding a telephone in one hand to listen to battlefield reports, while holding a pen in other.

Following the Fall of Washington and the widespread exile of many former Federalists, Stillwell and his men initially escaped to Canada. Disliking the intercine bickering in the Republic in Exile, Stillwell utilized his connections in China to secure a position with the Beijing government.

He graduated from the Nanjing Jiangnan Naval Academy in 1902, before going on to further education in the United Kingdom. This was followed by a career in the modernizing Qing navy, where Du served on and captained some of the largest ships under Chinese control. During the Wuchang uprising, he deserted the Qing Empire, and aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. During the Zhili-dominated government of 1923/1924 he served as Minister of the Navy. During the KMT’s Northern Expedition a large number of his sailors nearly convinced him to desert, but the presence of German warships kept him in line, and he supported the German Navy in their coastal bombardment missions. Restored to his position of Minister of the Navy, Du has little time left for active ship command.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHad an extensive opium and drinking habit in his youth.

Here, he became acquainted with many future Zhili Clique generals. Quickly promoted through the ranks, Wu stayed largely isolated from many of the political turmoils that ensnared fellow naval officers, and has a reputation of being somewhat ‘apolitical’ - or the closest to apolitical one can get in this period in Chinese history.

Returning home, he participated in the Sino-Japanese war, where as the youngest commander in the Qing Navy he was forced to surrender to the Japanese after the Battle of Wehawei after all his commanding officers committed suicide. Leading the naval reforms after the peace treaty was signed, Sa was largely oblivious to the larger political maelstrom brewing in China. During the Wuchang uprising he faced a full-scale mutiny, and retired to Shanghai rather than either fire on his own men, or betray his country. He briefly served as Acting Premier in 1920, before taking the largely ceremonial position of the Governor of Fujian in 1922, where he essentially planned to retire. Here, he became acquainted with the Zhili clique and began to advise Wu and other, junior members of the Navy on modernizing the aging fleet.

In 1900, Zaixun's predecessor, Zaiyi, who succeeded Yizhi as 'Prince Rui of the Second Rank' (later renamed to 'Prince Duan of the Second Rank'), was stripped off his title of nobility and exiled to Xinjiang for his role in the Boxer Rebellion. Two years later, Zaixun succeeded Zaiyi as a beile of the Prince Rui peerage. In 1908, he was made an acting junwang (Prince of the Second Rank) but remained nominally a beile. In 1909, Zaixun was appointed as an acting Navy Minister in the Imperial Cabinet headed by Prince Qing. Later, he was sent to Europe and the United States to study the navies of the Western powers. After returning to China, in 1911, he became a full Navy Minister. Following Puyi's autocoup, he has come out of retirement to serve again as Navy minister. Despite never holding a battle command in his life he has been granted an admiralship. It is yet to be seen if he can competently command a warship in battle."

Only 17 during Puyi's restoration, the corruption and scandal that plagued the new empire greatly dismayed the impressionable young man, and on the suggestion of a friend he attended clandestine meetings of the Young China Party. From those meetings he attended the Baoding military academy, where he quickly stood out as both politically and militarily shrewd. Along with Fang Zhejian he assembled a group of young cadets dedicated to reforming the Empire.

Unfortunately for Fang, warlord soldiers arrived in the provincial capital and burned the school, nearly killing Fang. The young man was left with a scar running down his leg and a burning hatred for warlords and the chaos they inflicted on the poor of China. After taking the entrance exams to Baoding Military Academy, he joined the Young China Party branch at the campus, though his sympathies lay more with the NCERA. He led one of the squads that arrested and executed senior Zhili leadership during the coup, and the command experience he picked up there made him stand out so much to Li Bingzhi that he promoted the young man on the spot."

For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Vrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist.

It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment.

POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Aleksandr Kerenskiy, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerenskiy sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Kerenskiy returned to power in 1921, as the first President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerenskiy marks his fifteenth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerenskiy established land reform, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the New Economic Policy program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerenskiy has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition. The President remains certain, however - his rule will end either by constitutional decree or by a bullet."

As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."

He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1921, Chernov and Kerenskiy formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last fifteen years. While Kerenskiy was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."
POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerenskiy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Aleksandr Kerenskiy. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."
POLITICS_NIKOLAI_TRUBETSKOY_DESC:0 "Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy represents a new generation of Russian nobility, an educated, ideologically driven upper class which is opposed to radicalism from the right and from the left. A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Russian Union", a conservative monarchist party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pavel Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

A talented cavalry officer from a family which gifted several commanders to the Imperial Russian Army, Vrangel distinguished himself during the Brusilov Offensive, where he showed himself as an aggressive yet trustworthy commander. For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Vrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist. And no matter what he might do, his officers will follow him regardless - to this day, junior officers in the Army ask themselves: "If Baron Vrangel was here, what would he do?""

POLITICS_VASILY_MAKLAKOV_DESC:0 "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasiliy Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defense of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticized Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigoriy Semyenov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1921 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."
POLITICS_TYRKOVA_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the Octobrists. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalized her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead. \n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Russian Union.

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect. \n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armored train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armored vehicles and maneouvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."
POLITICS_LAVR_KORNILOV_DESC:0 "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerenskiy's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."

Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labor for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticized their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern. \n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Aleksandra Kollontay, he founded the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."
POLITICS_KARL_RADEK_DESC:0 "Karl Radek would struggle to count the number of socialist movements he's had a hand in over the years. Born in Austria-Hungary to a Jewish Litvak family, he joined the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and participated in the Revolution of 1905 in Warsaw - only to get expelled a few years later as a part of an anti-semitic and anti-Leninist campaign within the party. Briefly, he worked for the German SPD, before getting expelled as well. He worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did not stay in Russia either, however - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser. \n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life, however - instead of executing him like what the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans and was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through use of extensive state planning, in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."

After returning from exile in Siberia in 1917, he joined the October Revolution, although he disagreed with the radical inclinations of the Bolshevik movement, and was put in charge of the fledgling Soviet state's industry. During this period, he organized the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov. \n\nKollontay was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Aleksandr Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik. \n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organized the underground Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party.

An avowed monarchist, Kappel remained silent at first, hoping for a restoration of the Romanov order once the situation stabilizes, but soon began to plot with other future White generals. When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade. After the end of the Bolshevik uprising, Kappel remained in the army and became one of the most important generals in its infantry corps.

In the years that followed, he tried several prospective careers, including submarines and aircraft, but ultimately decided to stick to ground forces. His real career began after the February Revolution, when he was the first to denounce the authority of the republican government in Moscow and disobeyed orders. Stationed in Romania, he watched the Bolshevik takeover from afar and formed a military unit of his own, the Drozdovites, which marched off to join Mikhail Alekseyev's Volunteer Army in the Don.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he gained the reputation of a talented and strict, if reckless commander, who always made sure to assert that he was fighting for the holy House of Romanov.

Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovskiy stood by the Republic.

Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare. \n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilization never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilization and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war.

POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Born to a Russian father and Polish mother, Anton Denikin chose to embrace the patriotism of the former, and tied the rest of his life with the Imperial Russian Army. By the Great War, he was a major general and a chief of staff in Kiev Military District, and a prolific writer who analysed the shortcomings of the Russian army. A second in command to Lavr Kornilov, he escaped to Southern Russia alongside him and helped form the Volunteer Army which would ultimately put an end to the Bolshevik revolution. It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment. Politics are the last thing on his mind, but should he end up in power one way or another, Denikin's experience in the Russian chief of staff will lead to him commanding the nation like he used to command his regiment."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Aleksandr Kerenskiy, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerenskiy sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Kerenskiy returned to power in 1921, as the first President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerenskiy marks his fifteenth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerenskiy established land reform, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the New Economic Policy program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerenskiy has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition. The President remains certain, however - his rule will end either by constitutional decree or by a bullet."
POLITICS_IRAKLIY_TSERETELI_DESC:0 "A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakliy Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognize the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."
POLITICS_VIKTOR_CHERNOV_DESC:0 "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasiliy Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1921, Chernov and Kerenskiy formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last fifteen years. While Kerenskiy was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."
POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerenskiy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Aleksandr Kerenskiy. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."

He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Russian Union", a conservative monarchist party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pavel Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."
POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_DESC:0 "Among Russian generals of Baltic German birth, of which there are many, Pyetr Vrangel is perhaps the most famous. A talented cavalry officer from a family which gifted several commanders to the Imperial Russian Army, Vrangel distinguished himself during the Brusilov Offensive, where he showed himself as an aggressive yet trustworthy commander. For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Vrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war.

POLITICS_VASILY_MAKLAKOV_DESC:0 "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasiliy Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defense of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticized Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigoriy Semyenov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1921 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."
POLITICS_TYRKOVA_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the Octobrists. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalized her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead. \n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Russian Union. Russia's first democratically elected female head of state has a deeply conservative society to resist against, but she is no pushover, and will not shy away to assert Russia's role as the harbringer of Eurasia."

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect. \n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armored train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armored vehicles and maneouvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."
POLITICS_LAVR_KORNILOV_DESC:0 "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerenskiy's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."

Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labor for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticized their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern. \n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Aleksandra Kollontay, he founded the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

Briefly, he worked for the German SPD, before getting expelled as well. He worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did not stay in Russia either, however - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser. \n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life, however - instead of executing him like what the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans and was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through use of extensive state planning, in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."

During this period, he organized the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov. \n\nKollontay was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Aleksandr Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik. \n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organized the underground Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party.

An avowed monarchist, Kappel remained silent at first, hoping for a restoration of the Romanov order once the situation stabilizes, but soon began to plot with other future White generals. When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade. After the end of the Bolshevik uprising, Kappel remained in the army and became one of the most important generals in its infantry corps.

In the years that followed, he tried several prospective careers, including submarines and aircraft, but ultimately decided to stick to ground forces. His real career began after the February Revolution, when he was the first to denounce the authority of the republican government in Moscow and disobeyed orders. Stationed in Romania, he watched the Bolshevik takeover from afar and formed a military unit of his own, the Drozdovites, which marched off to join Mikhail Alekseyev's Volunteer Army in the Don.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he gained the reputation of a talented and strict, if reckless commander, who always made sure to assert that he was fighting for the holy House of Romanov.

Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovskiy stood by the Republic.

Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare. \n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilization never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilization and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war.

Early in his life, he got drawn to Georgian nationalist poetry and enrolled in the Tiflis Seminary, but abandoned his previous calling when he came into contact with socialist literature. He dedicated himself to Marxism, joined the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, and raised money for the revolution with protection rackets, counterfeiting and bank robberies. He was a loyal follower of Lenin and represented the party in the public by running the newspaper 'Pravda', and his articles there helped make a name for himself as well.\n\nDuring the fateful months of 1917, Dzhugashvili helped organize the July Days uprising and the October Revolution, and gained a seat in the Sovnarkom. He, Lenin and Trotsky formed the informal troika which controlled the state - as a result, Dzhugashvili was sent to Tsaritsyn to organize resistance against the Whites, where he showed himself as an okay, if reckless commander. Once Lenin was assassinated in August 1918, it was Trotsky who took charge and not him - but the Soviet state was not one to last, eventually collapsing. Dzhugashvili, unlike Trotsky, managed to escape, making his way to France with the rest of the Bolshevik remnants, and helped reestablish the Party in exile.\n\nTo support the Patagonian Syndicalist revolution, Dzhugashvili was sent to the Southern Cone alongside a mission of other Bolsheviks, and alongside Tukhachevskiy, he is one of the highest ranking Internationale officials in Patagonia, albeit unlike Tukhachevskiy, representing the political interests of the Internationale.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Aligned with the Communist faction."
POLITICS_VASILY_CHUIKOV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§LFebruary 12th, 1900, in Serebryanye Prudy, Tula Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nVasiliy Chuykov was born into nothing - an impoverished peasant family deep in Central Russia, struck by hunger, unable to maintain twelve children. At the age of twelve, he left his family home and travelled across the country, ending up in Petrograd - there, he became a child labourer in a military factory, producing spurs for cavalry officers. The Revolution of 1917 left the seventeen year old Chuykov unemployed, but thanks to the contacts of one of his older brothers, he was recruited into the Red Guards, and from there, into the Red Army.\n\nChuykov achieved the rank of company commander, showing off skill at commanding troops, but ending up fairly inconsequential in the grand events beyond his understanding. He did, however, manage to escape to France alongside the remnants of the Red Army. Separated from his home, his family and whatever was left of his ordinary life, he had only one path left to pursue - join the Bolshevik remnants, enroll for officer training and become a commander in the French army. As a close associate of Mikhail Tukhachevskiy, he was assigned to the Internationale mission to Patagonia, where he hopes to prove his worth."
POLITICS_GEORGY_ZHUKOV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§LDecember 1st, 1896, in Strelkovka, Kaluga Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to an impoverished peasant family in Central Russia, Georgiy Zhukov never considered himself to be a military man in the making, instead apprenticing to be a furrier in his brother's workshop in Moscow. Then the Weltkrieg came, and with it, Zhukov was conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army. Here, he found his calling, displaying skill, bravery, and finishing server as a non-commissioned cavalry officer. After the October Revolution, he briefly went back home, but once again returned to the frontlines, this time as a junior commander in the Red Army.\n\nZhukov's service was rather brief, however, but once the Soviet regime collapsed, he escaped his homeland with numerous other Red Army commanders, and landed in France. Getting accustomed to a completely foreign country was difficult, but Zhukov had fully dedicated himself to the Bolshevik course by then and pushed forward with dedication - he completed officer training courses, maintained contact with Mikhail Tukhachevskiy and studied modern strategy from his superior, and voluntarily joined the Internationale mission to Patagonia. Dutifully loyal to the cause of the Revolution, he is often seen as the most trustworthy and reliable of the Bolshevik quartet, even if his inexperience holds him back from promotions."

POLITICS_MLACERDA_SPO_DESC:0 "Hailing from inner Minas Gerais and born in 1887, Maria Lacerda de Moura was raised by her anticlerical, spiritist parents in the somewhat larger paulista town of Barbacena, and began her political and social history shortly after becoming a full time teacher, campaigning for nationwide education reform and literacy efforts. She was publishing books as early as 1918 and started to author articles 8 years before that, and during this period that she began to be influenced by anarchist and syndicalist thought. Despite issues with suffragette movements, whom she saw as 'not fighting for enough change', she has always been one of the foremost feminist activists in the country, something that no doubt influenced in her choice as Chairwoman by progressive minded delegates, but she also has held a position among the most respected lefitist academics and authours on São Paulo. Now, São Paulo's first head of state has the daunting task of leading the continuing socialization of the government, rising demands of officers and the ever contentious Congress of Trade Unions, as some still rose issues regarding her birthplace, but her experience and fame seem to indicate she is more than prepared for the task; or so the nation hopes."
POLITICS_ISIDORO_DIAS_SPO_DESC:0 "One of, if not the most, respected military officer in all of former Brazil, Isidoro Dias Lopes has always been held in high regard in his adoptive home of São Paulo. While his task as President is a thankless one, he is one of the very few men to be respected all across the political spectrum, and thus has the gravitas necessary to ensure that São Paulo's transition into a sovereign state goes as smoothly as possible. However, time stops for no man, and a cloud of uncertainty looms overhead, as the power vacuum Isidoro will leave behind when he dies will certainly have colossal consequence for the young republic and its people's hopes."
POLITICS_JANIO_QUADROS_SPO_DESC:0 "Born in Mato Grosso do Sul in 1917, Jânio da Silva Quadros is one of the leading members of the new generation of Social Democrats that grew up and lived through the worst of the Black Monday crisis and its damaging fallout. The volatile years that followed allowed for the relatively young law school teacher to firmly establish himself in the political scene in São Paulo, decrying the corruption and inefficiency that has always plagued the state's government even before independence. His populist, aggressive campaign, that didn't even spare members of his own party, resonated with the people, who gleefully sang along to his slogans of ''Brooming'' the Paulista politics of the old, decrepit elites of Brazil. Despite all his ambitious plans, he still a democrat and constrained by constitutionale limits, but that has not stopped his enemies accusing him of Syndicalism and treason alike."
POLITICS_MANUEL_TOLEDO_SPO_DESC:0 "Perhaps the oldest political actor of great relevance in the nation, Pedro Manuel de Toledo has a long and rich political career that began almost concurrently with the rise of the republic itself. A staunch defender of liberty and the republic, he was involved in numerous revolts and conspiracies against the status quo, and wrote extensively on matters from secret voting to state autonomy. Of these revolts, his role in the large scale uprising in São Paulo is of great importance, as he saw the federal meddling as a direct attack on republican principles; he does not make great effort to hide his satisfaction on São Paulo having finally ''gotten rid of the dead weight pulling it down'', as he comptemptly calls the other former Brazilian states. Having somewhat recently ended a term as president of São Paulo, Toledo decided he was ready to become president of a sovereign, independent state now, even while well into his eighties. His age is seen as his main obstacle by the people, but politics is rarely that simple, and his presidential victory did not grant his party full control of the lower house, which might very well be an issue unless he is willing to work with some of the more virulent opposition politicians. A lawyer but chiefly diplomat by trade, he personally opposes any kind of foreign military adventures by São Paulo, but intends to respect all existing treaties regardless."
POLITICS_CARDOSO_MELO_SPO_DESC:0 "A paulista born in 1883, José Joaquim Cardoso de Melo Neto has always been an accomplished law and policy-maker. His terms as teacher of law were left behind when he joined politics more intensely after the revolt against Rio in his state in 1927, but he was active in a minor scale for a full decade prior in minor legislatures and activities. Having since been a staple figure in the Brazilian parliament, he has found himself now as President of São Paulo, albeit not in the way he expected this to pass; for São Paulo is now an independent state, instead of being primus inter pares of Brazil. As he has to juggle the ever scheming paulista elites and the demands of foreign nations, his task may seem daunting at first, but popular support for the new republic and the plans to modernize the nation have granted him plenty of political capital to deal with domestically."
POLITICS_JULIO_PRESTES_SPO_DESC:0 "A representative of a powerful and traditional family in São Paulo, Juilio Prestes debuted in the political arena in 1909 as a state representative in the parliament of São Paulo. He quickly distinguished himself, and even led troops into battle against mutinous military men twice before becoming a federal representative, where his liberal character gave him admiration from many. A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devastated by his sudden assatination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington, even if his dream of a united Brazil seems now forever condemned. Following the defeat of Brazil's military and the establishment of the Republic of São Paulo, Julio found himself as the clear frontrunner to become the first president, and his victory in these snap elections again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positivist principles he defended throughout his life, despite claims of fraud and foreign interference by some of his opposition."
POLITICS_BERTOLDO_HOS_SPO_DESC:0 "Bertoldo Ritter Klinger, like many officers currently living in São Paulo, was born in the then Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, and garrisoned several locations across that country, including Rio. His actions and service during the Interstate War are quite noteworthy, as is his is exemplary record of always standing up for what he believed was the right thing, as his career was often set back by his participation in a variety of mutinies with an even greater variety of motivations, from opposing mandatory vaccination to better conditions in the barracks for infantrymen. His position at the forefront of such popular causes, and his staunch replublican beliefs, have been decisive factors on making the officer the first president of the Republic of São Paulo, where he is seen a stabilizing factor amidst the constant bickering of the nation's oligarchs and powerful families."
POLITICS_SALGADO_HOS_SPO_DESC:0 "Júlio Marcondes César Salgado was born in Pindamonhangaba. São Paulo, to family with a long tradition in military duty and Paulista politics, he himself a relative of Inácio de Siqueira Salgado, the baron of Itapeva. He has a long service record, started at age 16, and has fought both in the Interstate War and against the ever frequent Syndicalist and Tenentist uprisings in his state, and his veterancy has put him in a condition of being the commander-in-chief and nominal head of state of the newly declared Republic of São Paulo, at least until 'order is properly restored', but few doubt his tenure will hardly be a short one. Having led his state's forces in battle against the rest of Brazil before, Julio isn't exactly phased by the rapid changes brought by the break up of Brazil, and sees São Paulo's freedom as a positive happening for its people. However, unrest is not yet over in the state, and few can predict what foes the new republic might face abroad in such dangerous times."
POLITICS_LOBATAO_DA_MASSA_DESC:0 "A native of Taubaté, José Bento Renato Monteiro Lobato is among São Paulo's foremost intellectuals and authors, and has always had a penchant for getting his nose into politics since a young age. While he is known by most younger Paulistas as the author of beloved children's books and his escapades while campaigning for nationalization of the Brazilian oil sector, the political class knows his radical and often erratic rhetoric dates back many years before he was thrust into power. A member of the São Paulo Eugenics Society, he has always advocated for harsh measures to maintain what he views as a pure society, and has even written books with highly prejudiced concepts behind them, and now openly praises the activities of the KKK, something he had previously done in private. His economic stances are no less extreme, defending radical nationalization and industrialization programs; he has for decades argued against foreigners getting access to his nation's wealth. His belief in a harsh, 'dog eat dog' view of diplomatic affairs also is his north when dealing with other nations,especially his so called 'benefactors', whom he sees as a necessary ally to rid São Paulo of its 'worst elements' through an intense immigration incentive program. Said abrasive rhetoric has certainly not fallen in deaf ears, but has also led to an escalation of social and racial violence across São Paulo, but it remains to be seen if this dog is all bark, or if Lobato's bite will truly leave its mark."

Closely aligned with National France, to the point claiming him to be a puppet would not be out of place, he sees not only Piedmont but all of Italy as under foreign occupation and seeks to liberate it, but he has also to deal with the ever contentious relationship between Exiles and Sardinians, both of whom question the uneasy balance that has established itself in Sardinia."

The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally.

In 1904, Song traveled to Beijing to learn recieve military instruction under Lu Jianzhang. After a decade of service, Lu Jianzhang slotted Song into service under Yuan Shikai during his rise. Following the assault on Zhang Xun in Beijing, Song deserted Yuan to join the KMT, and threw in his loyal divisions under their government. In 1925, Song requested Chiang governorship of Shandong should the province be claimed. The subsequent Northern Expedition fell apart for Song in 1929, and he held Linyi in Shandong against Zhang Zongchang. Any hope of reinforcements were dashed by 1930, depriving Song of legitimacy. A solution to this crisis in confidence came when Song heard the Duke Yansheng was in mortal danger. Living in the Mount Tai Miao, the descendant of Confuicius was threatened by the newly-arrived Yiguandao, which desputed his orthodox religion.

Arriving in Shanghai to pledge allegiance to the Republic, he fell in with Feng Guozhang and joined the Zhili Clique when they emerged in 1917. When the Fengtian and Zhili Clique turned on each other in 1920, Zongchang was withdrawing his forces from across Northern China back into Shandong. This allowed Zongchang to commit most of his forces to the Fengtian Clique when Zhang Zhoulin made peace with Sun Yat Sen in 1926. Zongchang ordered his army again to retreat into Shandong when the Fengtian Clique needed him most. This retreat made Shandong into his prison as well as refuge, where he was an illegal but tolerated occupying force under the shadow of the Qing. An ability to utilize railroads effectively as well as the unusual charisma of a man referred to as “filthy” by even his allies carried him through to victory. As medicine was out of his reach financially, a bout of sickness drew him up the 6,600 steps to a Yiguandao doctor. Zongchang eventually met the Yiguandao’s Honored Teacher, Zhang Tianran. Whether it was his sickness or the lack of anything else to do up on Mount Tai, Zongchang promised Tianran that he would follow the esoteric lifestyle espoused by the cult for his health."
POLITICS_ZHANG_TIANRAN_DESC:0 "Tianran aspired to nothing in his life until he was introduced into the cult of Lu Zhongyi. Lu Zhongyi was the leader of a small group of religious syncretists called the Yiguandao in 1918. Lu Zhongyi had always planned for his sister Lu Zhongjie to succeed him to lead the Yiguandao, and had even recognized her supposed divinity as the reincarnation of the Buddhist God Guan Yin. A theological schism occurred after the passing of Lu Zhongyi in 1930, wherein Lu Zhongjie took followers loyal to her out of the Yiguandao and relocated to Henan, where they remain to this day. Tianran, having the full trust of his members as well as a newly divined wife Sun Suzhen, began to tell startling revelations. In 1922, Tianran had built a shrine on Mount Tai, which grew until it encompassed the other monasteries on the mountain. By 1924 Mount Tai had become the year-round home for Zhang Tianran and his inner circle. A spirit writing session that same year foretold Emperor Puyi was in danger of being poisoned, and a trip to Beijing was planned. Tianran amused and flattered Emperor Puyi with promises that the Yiguandao would reinforce loyalty to the Qing through charity and warfare if need be. The first Red Spears and Big Swords arrived to Mount Tai in 1925. The greatest catch was Tianran’s supposed conversion of Zhang Zongchang in 1935."

Li's first major decoration was in fighting the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. An association with Anhui general Qu Tongfeng guided Li towards clique politics during the republican years. Like Qu Tongfeng, who was cast out of the Anhui Clique for corruption, Li was set adrift and found his way into the Fengtian clique in 1924. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin reassigned Li that year to Zhang Zongchang, who was fighting in Zhili. Li was initially impressed with Zhang Zongchang's ability in spite of his lack of manners, but this appreaisal turned sour by 1928, when Zongchang became entrenched in Shandong. Li, despite his history of corruption, could not properly pay his division on taxes collected honestly in Shandong. Li, having taken inspiration from the decleration of Xue Dian as the Yiguandao's minor Emperor in Shandong, decided to present himself as spiritually enlightened.

There the soldiers showed extreme prejudice in raiding the countryside, attaching religious significance to their banditry. The Ma Clique retaliated, and Sun's bandits retreated to Shandong in 1928.

Qu returned to China and served as instructor at the Wuyang Academy of Military Sciences in 1910. Initially cooperating with the Republicans in the Wuchang uprising of 1911, Qu bounced around to different posts in the Republic, eventually returning to Yuan briefly before running the Shandong Military Affairs Office in 1916. Qu made an agreement in 1917 with Li Yuanhong to sell mineral rights to an aluminum mine in Shandong to Japan, and allow shipments out of Yantai. The Anhui Clique in 1920, feuding with Li Yanhong, rescinded this right and requested Qu to Nanjing to stand trial. Rather than stand trial, Qu faked illness and postponed his trip until the Anhui Clique became disinterested in 1925. A letter from Sun Yat Sen, requesting Qu rally himself against Wu Peifu stirred him into action, attempting to organize a force in Shandong to join. This force choose to fight Zhang Zongchang upon his arrival to Shandong in 1926, being soundly defeated, and Qu went into hiding. The lack of central authority, and the idea that Sun Yat Sen ordered him to fight but he failed weighed heavily on Qu. Qu was then invited to Fengtian by Zhang Zuolin, who offered to redeem Qu if he joined the Beiyang Navy. Qu, distrusting the Japanese presence in Manchuria, refused and left. Qu is recalled once again, when the current leader of Shandong asks to rebuild the Beiyang Fleet in earnest in Shandong, motivated by a promise to Sun Chuanfang to fight Wu Peifu. "

POLITICS_RICCARDO_LOMBARDI_DESC:0 "Born in Regalbuto, Sicily, on August 16th 1901, Riccardo Lombardi lived in the region long before the Socialist takeover. However, he does identify himself with that government. Specifically, he considers himself a part of the Christian-Socialist faction within the S.R.I., the Fasci. This does not mean he has always been this way; Lombardi and close friend Guido Mignoli hopped from party to party until hedging their bets with the Socialists, and have now founded their own faction in the form of the Fasci. His ideology can be described in many ways, and his recent popularity is probably best explained by the fact that his supporters can project their beliefs onto him. Syndicalists, Socialists, Communists, and even some Liberals who identify with the Crocean faction can identify with the man, and this combined with his political talent has made him a formidable force within Italy. With this support, he has sharply criticized the government's inability to provide for it's people, drawing on a combination of populist, religious, and socialist rhetoric to energize his supporters, who come from every walk of life. Now that he has taken power, he hopes to move forward with his agenda of Christian-Socialism, providing for his people and dealing with his enemies in the Mafia and elsewhere. One of the largest threats to Lombardi's power will certainly come from Julius Evola, who has been a rival to Lombardi for years and whom Lombardi has energetically opposed. The two mostly recently clashed when Lombardi and his men defended a socialist newspaper hub from Evola's men, and only time can tell what the outcome of this rivalry will be. One thing is clear though: with Lombardi in charge of the Socialist Republic of Italy, its people know their interests will be represented at last, and the country will prosper because of it."

While being nominally subservient to British interests, Maxamuud Cali Shiire's support of Abdullah Hassan, the Mad Mullah, was crucial in defeating Italy in Africa during the Weltkrieg. A savvy political navigator, Maxamuud has united the sultanates of Somalia under a federal monarchy under his nominal leadership; but can a man who declared war against his own father for power be trusted not to infringe on constitutional prerogatives?"
POLITICS_BARRE_DESC:0 "A Marehan Darod hailing from the Ogaden, Siad Barre has always been a competent and enthusiastic officer.

POLITICS_Gustaf_V_DESC:0 "Gustaf V Bernadotte was born in 1858 and was the crown-prince of Sweden and Norway from 1872. It is no wonder that he is a man of the old ways, as during his father's reign the King of Sweden acted both as head of state and head of government, with ministers held responsible only to him. However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around."

politics_nils_flyg_desc:0 "The figurehead of Swedish totalism, Nils 'Nisse' Flyg, is considered by many to be a colourful character. Born in the Stockholm working-class neighbourhood of Södermalm, Flyg has been active in the Swedish radical left since a young age. In 1917, he split off from the SAP with Zeth Höglund and Karl Kilbom to form the Swedish Communist Party, a brief experiment that soon failed when the Russian revolution was crushed. Nonetheless, the young Flyg would prove to be a force to be reckoned within the Swedish left.\n\nIn more recent years, Flyg distanced himself from his less radical comrades and took on the doctrine of total commitment to the Revolution propagated by the Sorelians in the Commune of France and Oswald Mosley in the Union of Britain, though adding his own unique values to it as well: Flyg is known to oppose notions of an indigenous socialist revolution in America and, ironic to his previous positions, Russia, believing that the revolution has to originate in Europe as it would otherwise take the shape of anti-European imperialism, noting on the side that neither Russia nor America harbours an orthodox totalist movement."

After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1925 to find the dream of democratic Lebanon dead. In Lebanons's rubble, Antoun founded an organisation called Natural Syria, dedicated to a non-sectarian independent Syria that could stand against Ottoman and Western Imperialism. Sharing only a distaste for imperialism, Antoun rejected the message of the syndicalists as divisive and rejected the Ba'ath ideals. Antoun sees Natural Syria as the homeland of ally Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Lebanese regardless of race. In his writing, Antoun claims that he will merge the best parts of socialism, nationalism, and patriotism under the Zawbaa."
POLITICS_FAWZI_QUWU_DESC:0 "Captain of the 12th Ottoman corps of Mosul, Fawzi had proven his bravery to the Turks. Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him in during his time in the Jerusalem Vilyet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli. Despite his exile from Syria twice, he has again returned and collects his allies in preparation for a new type of Republican government. Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."
POLITICS_SULTAN_ATRASH_DESC:0 "Sultan Atrash is relied upon by the Syrian people not because he is a great unifier. Atrash openly admits that he seeks autonomy for his Druze people against the wishes of his own allies. This push for autonomy of Syria's minority groups is however unilateral. Atrash wishes to rebuke pan arabism and protect Syria as a nation of minorities."
POLITICS_NAZIK_AL_ABID_DESC:0 "Once exiled to Cairo in the wake of a Turkish crackdown, Nazik al Abid has pulled off an incredible achievement other Arab feminists like Tarab Abdul Hadi could only dream of; for she was elected head of state of Syria. Her work establishing the International Red Crescent and her liberal position towards veils has finally paid in dividends for her and for women across Syria, as her notoriety has put her in a prime position to lobby for their rights in the country."

Where many of this contemporaries joined secret societies and stocked weapons, Al Asali knew that legislation would lead to Syria's freedom. When the pen signed Syria's independence, he was in Cairo in Hal'il meeting with heads of state. It is through the outside in that Sabri al-Asali assumed power in Syria. He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_MICHEAL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was in Paris during the Syndicalist revolution. Swept up in the socialist organisations, he joined the Commune's government as an informal student. There he studied trade unionism with Saladin al Bitar, and they both decided that Syria was ready for revolution in 1925. The revolution to be, a renaissance or Ba'ath, never materialised. Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emancipator and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damascus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters. This will not stop Aflaq from realizing the dream of Ba'ath however, a united Syrian proletariat."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favour of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."

POLITICS_NICHOLAS_ROERICH_DESC:0 "Raised by the aristocratic Roerich family of St. Petersberg, Nicholas has expressed interest in both the aesthetic and spiritual side of socialist revolution. This interest led Nicholas first into the Arts, where he graduated from St. Petersberg University and the Imperial Academy of the Arts in 1897. Nicholas became immersed in Russian avant garde art, which included working with the legendary Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky. The October Revolution ended the social peace that Nicholas had known, and set Nicholas closer to social conservatism and orientalism in opposition to Vladimir Lenin.\nNicholas Roerich fled to the United States and joined the Theosophical Society, a spiritual movement that shared Roerich's admiration of undeveloped nations as 'more spiritually pure' than westernized counterparts. Roerich visited the Theosophical Society in both the Bhaatiya Commune and British Dominion in 1930, and had a startling conversation with Gandhi. Gandhi expressed to Roerich that Vladimir Lenin was not against traditional culture, but against corrupt leaders of traditional institutions.\nNicholas Roerich decided to take his family to visit Tibet through the Shimla mountains, and received a second calling in the mountains. A sherpa guiding Roerich remarked 'Is it true, that Lenin was not against Buddhism?' This led to a religious experince in Nicholas, which ended the expedition when he spoke of this in Lhasa. Nicholas began describing Vladimir Lenin as 'Mahatma Lenin' and was forced to leave Tibet by the Ganden Phodrang for this heretical idea. Back in Bharatiya, Nicholas was alerted to a possible revolution in Tibet eminating from Sikkim. In Sikkim, Nicholas Roerich combined his revelations with an endorsement from Gandhi to form the Sacred Union Party, a revolutionary party dedicated to saving Tibetan Buddhism through esoteric leninism."

Raised and educated by the prestigious Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the young Choekyi Nyima was predestined to be the 'Great Scholar' under the Dalai Lama, and was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 9th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev, who taught him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the center of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala. Political realities came in 1924 when the 13th Dalai Lama was modernizing his army. The Dalai Lama demanded more taxation from the Panchen Lama as part of his feudal duties. When the Panchen Lama refused, The Dalai Lama cut off the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and confiscated the Panchen Lama's property. The resulting conflict forced the Panchen Lama to flee Tibet to Mongolia in 1924.\nThe Panchen Lama, seeing Mongolia as unable to aid in his return under Baron Ungern, left for Bharatiya in 1931. In Bharatiya, the Panchen Lama connected with the other exiled Tibetan nobles Pandatsang Rapga and Thubten Kunphela. These two exiles had connection in Kham, and had aligned themselves with exiled KMT generals to form the Tibet Improvement Party. The Panchen Lama, seeing no othr way to return to Tibet save for an invasion, joined the Tibet Improvement Party and began publishing commentaries of Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles of the People. The storm of the revolution saw the Panchen Lama promise to preserve the existence of the Ganden Phodrang while removing their ability to choose the Kashag."
POLITICS_TSIPON_LUNGSHAR_DESC:0 "Tsipön Lungshar comes from a family that has served the Dalai Lama since the 18th century, and has deep connections to Lhasa. Lungshar was choosen to supervise the elite education of four nobles called the 'Rugby Four' in the UK prior to the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Lungshar stood in between the more radical nobles like Thuben Kunphela and Trimön in the early years of the Regency. It was Lungshar who accused Thuben Kunphela of orchestrating a foreign infiltration of Tibet in 1933, leading to his exile. However, Lungshar also opposed the power of the Regency, especially their strongman Trimön. Trimön orchestrated a trial where Lungshar was accused of being a socialist, then blinded before being exiled to Sikkim. The revolution saved Lungshar's life, and enabled him to return to Tibet and found the Kyicho Kuntun, a moderate political party that wishes to balance the needs of democracy with the traditions of Tibet."

Tsarong previously had a very successful career leading the Dob Dobs in defending Tibet from the Qing during the Xinhai revolution. Defeating the Qing earned Tsarong the name 'Hero of Chaksam', and he used his popularity to increase the national budget for Tibet's army. This indirectly caused the expulsion of the Panchen Lama in 1924. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama left the country in the control of the Regency, led by the 5th Reting Rinpoche and Trimön. Tsarong was demoted from Commander-In-Chief to Civil Engineer and Treasurer, but this failed to stop his popularity. Trimön was initially happy when Tsarong left for Utsang, along with his Young Tibet movment, but now Trimön sits in the Potala prison while Tsarong has effectively assumed his position.

The Reting Rinpoche stood behind Trimön's continuation of the tax increases, and stands as the most legitimate leader of Tibet until the 14th Dalai Lama is found.

In the final year of the 13th Dalai Lama, Trimön happend upon the macinations of Lungshar, and personally persuaded the aging Dalai Lama to order Lungshar blinded for his liberal schemes. Trimön used this political affair to become a close confident with the regent, the young Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen.

How did he come to such a life?\n\nWhen the civil war was raging in the vast expanses of Russia, Kolchak, in many ways suddenly for himself, was proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia during the putsch in November 1918. Having first arrested the SRS and declared martial law, the imminent catastrophe was stopped by Boris Savinkov, who agreed with Kolchak on the adoption of the SR agrarian reform. The Whites were united and strong. The Siberian army soon merged with other white armies and by the end of 1919 the Bolsheviks surrendered. Having made a difficult choice in favor of Russia, Kolchak made an equally difficult choice, renouncing the supreme power and approving the Second Constituent Assembly in 1920.\n\nHowever, his relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, the Japanese Intervention in Transamur and Eastern Karelian Revolt. These relations only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the government of Kerensky's "German lapdogs". The rogue admiral managed to escape from Russia and, ironically, found refuge in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur, the power in which belonged to the Kwantung army and the richest Merkulov family. Having enlisted the support of the ataman of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks Semenov and the East Siberian Oblastniks, as well as the support of Tokyo, Kolchak again found himself in the chair of the Supreme Ruler, but this time with a clear goal - to finish what he had started and overthrow the Petrograd regime."

This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state.

He never really saw the title of Grand Duke as much more than a promise for many years, but his long army career will probably have an impact in his reign. A pompous and proud man, he is eager to learn about the lands he now considers his, even if his sometimes obvious questions regarding landmarks make him almost feel like a noble a tourist rather than a Duke.

POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last twenty years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a member of the Italian Federation and now sovereign nation. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body, weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

## United States of America ##
POLITICS_RONALD_REAGAN_DESC:0 "Growing up and out of the rural reaches of Illinois, Ronald Reagan had first caught the public’s eye with his soothing voice and witty personality, culminating in a uniquely charismatic figure that many Americans would tune in to listen time to time. Not soon after the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, Reagan would find himself day by day at the front end of the microphone, broadcasting to the loyal men and women of the United States and offering a source of comfort to the soldiers on the federal frontlines. In such little time the radio star’s popularity skyrocketed, and after the war had ended he would ride his fame all the way to the Oval Office, as a ‘man of the people’, and a stalwart reminder of the United State’s perseverance against extremism. "
POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "A writer, a trade union leader, a Senator, a journalist and a Syndicalist - John 'Jack' Reed is many things. After the death of his predecessor, Alexander Berkman, this fiery radical socialist took the reins of the American syndicalist movement, and he has led this organisation to great success. While this long path from journalist to President has brought him many enemies, it also brought him many allies. He is determined to become the American version of Sebastian Faure, the founder of the Commune of France - a charismatic, unifying Syndicalist demagogue who shall turn his country into what he perceives to be a perfect society."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas and the new President of the United States. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. However, before becoming president, he was best known as an engineer, businessman, and the man in charge of the 'Commission for Relief' in Flanders-Wallonia. In addition to that record, he is also known for his two failed attempts to become the Republican nominee for President, losing once in 1920 to Leonard Wood and again in 1924 to Irvine Lenroot. Both Republicans would go on to lose their races, to Woodrow Wilson and A. Mitchell Palmer respectively. Hoover became the Republican nominee in 1928 as a compromise candidate between the Conservatives and Liberals within the party. With Hoover's victory in the 1928 Election, Republicans celebrated their victory, but their cheers would not last. As the United States was still in an economic slump, and began experiencing a major environmental catastrophy, that was and still is destroying the American farming industry. Part of Hoover's 28' campaign was the re-legalization of the SPA party, however, ever since the SPA entered into American political society, the growth of worker strikes (heavily linked to the SPA) and failures of negiotation have seen America's industry slow to a grinding halt. Hoover's policies of actively intervening in the economy and increasing the national debt has brought little success in improving the situtation overall. His victory in 1932 saw little celebrations as it was decided by a House vote, and this has made him quite possibly the most despised man in America. Everyone from Democrats to the ODP, SPA, and AFP are now calling him 'The Failed Humanitarian.'"
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_2_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. With his suprise victory in the 1936 election, he has become the second president in the 20th Century to break the tradtional two terms of the Presidency. Hoover now stands guard over a nation on the brink of another Civil War. Despite all the economic interventionism that Hoover made over the last two terms, it has not done much for the United States. According to some, including his new vice president, it actually made the problem worse. Hoover now acknowledges the dangerous position the country is in and has begun to listen to his advisors such as Vice President Knox, his new cabinet, General Douglas MacArthur, and Director J. Edgar Hoover to help him solve the various economic, societal and political crisises that now plague the United States of America."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_3_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States, and is the second president in the 20th Century to have three terms in office. Many thought that when Hoover won in 1936, the United States would be forever destroyed, and throughout his term it looked like it was inevitable at various points. However, the important thing to many Americans at the end of the day is that it didn't occur. Hoover has gone from the most liked to the most hated and then back to the most liked politican and president in recent American memory. With the failures of his previous terms long gone, along with many of the problems facing America throughout the 30s, President Hoover and his cabinet look to the future of what this great nation can accomblish with his remaining time in office. These past three terms have aged Hoover to such a degree that the term of adorement used by the public to describe Hoover is 'The Grand Old Man.'"
POLITICS_FRANK_KNOX_DESC:0 "William Franklin Knox is now the President of the United States. Knox is known for his service to the United States during the Spanish-American War, where he served in the Rough Riders under former President Theodore Roosevelt. Along with his service to the United States, Knox also became quite renowed for owning and operating several newspapers across the Midwest. Frank Knox is now in the most powerful position in America, and as a staunch internationalist and anti-isolationist, he will atempt to prepare the United States for whatever may come next, opposed to what previous administrations have done over the past 30 years."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Son of Lieutenant general and civil war veteran Arthur MacArthur, young Douglas was prepared from an early life for military service. Instilled with a concern for the common man out west, and a hatred for former Confederates due to harassment in West Point, Douglas became a fine soldier. After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_TWO_DESC:0 "Son of Lieutenant general and civil war veteran Arthur MacArthur, young Douglas was prepared from an early life for military service. Instilled with a concern for the common man out west, and a hatred for former Confederates due to harassment in West Point, Douglas became a fine soldier. After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington and elsewhere. This is a fact his men have learned and his enemies have learned even more so in recent times, but with the US defeated in the East, now only the Western Command Center remains. MacArthur has fled West and he seems to be a changed man, a new gleam in his eye. His anger and ultranationalism have only increased as a result of his loss in the East and he is now determined to win the war, whatever it takes..."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_D_LEAHY_DESC:0 "William Daniel Leahy, born in 1875 and growing up in the Midwest, may seem out of place in a nation of radicals, revolutionaries, and tyrants. However, as Leahy ambitiously climbed the ranks of the U.S. Navy, he always remained loyal to his country first and foremost. Like his fellow military men, Leahy was troubled by the growing chaos in the United States, and when Douglas MacArthur couped the government, Leahy was silent. As MacArthur began to crack down on both Congress and the U.S. Navy, however, enforcing his will on both groups, Leahy became more and more disenchanted with the American Caesar. When circumstances spiraled out of control, with MacArthur's actions threatening the war effort, Leahy decided it was time to take action. Now, in the aftermath of the navy coup, Leahy leads a fractured government and a broken people in what seems like an unwinnable conflict. Despite this, Leahy has friends, both in Washington and in the West, and his committment to democracy has soothed many who originally felt alienated by MacArthur's leadership. With grim determination and a sharp mind, Leahy will do whatever he must to restore democracy to his battered country."
POLITICS_ERNEST_J_KING_DESC:0 "When Douglas MacArthur took power in Washington, he did not anticipate the danger that an admiral could pose, and yet Admiral Ernest Joseph King has proved to be the cause of MacArthur's demise. King, a brilliant yet arrogant man with a love for the sea and the air alike, has had a remarkable few years. It seemed that his career would be fairly unremarkable until, in the mid-1930's, King was promoted along with many other officers in an effort to help deal with the growing extremist movements in the country. However, King, believing democracy itself to be the cause of the nation's woes, sided with MacArthur when the man came to power. When MacArthur began to lord over the U.S. Navy and worse, King himself, it was a step too far. Believing that MacArthur was neglecting the navy to the detriment of the war effort, and resenting the control of an army man, King led a coup against the government. Now that he runs the country, King has many plans. First and foremost, a significant investment in the U.S. Navy is just what King believes is needed to win the war. When that is done, though, King has further plans for America. Most of all, he wishes to see America take its rightful place in the world, and to do so, he is more than willing to step on potential rivals, especially the scheming remnants of the old Entente..."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "It's hard to say what the Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long exactly stands for. Some would say that his 'Share Our Wealth' programme is clearly just Syndicalism in new clothing, while others would point at his undemocratic, nepotist style of rule, topped by the usage of the 'Minutemen' paramilitary to harass rivals, as a sign of his National Populist stance. Whatever may be the case, President Long is liked by the common classes, his charisma is exceptional, even if he can get arrogant at times, and his foothold over the south is not to be underestimated."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONGDONG_DESC:0 "Huey Long barely escaped capture when the American Union State fell. Only our quick action was able to save him. Not content to disappear into the dust bin of history, he has now shown up in our capital promising to use his political talent and charisma to keep the Progressive Party in power for a decade or more. He has renounced many of his previous beliefs in favor of a more mainstream Progressive platform, though he insists on keeping his "Share the Wealth" program. His promise is quite alluring and his prowess is obvious, though we must keep a close eye on him..."
POLITICS_FLOYD_OLSON_DESC:0 "Despite his rural upbringing, Floyd Olson has been able to see the great diversity in America through travel and activism.Working as a Shabbos goy, an IWW stevedore, and finally an attorney pushed Olson towards Progressivism in the 1920s. Olson joined up with Robert LaFollete’s Progressive Party following the 1924 election. Olson worked tirelessly for the next decade in order to gain allies for the Progressive Party, stopping only to seek treatment for his stomach ulcers in 1930. A surprisingly influential Governor of Minnesota and a national advocate for peace catapulted him into the White House on a bipartisan ticket against radicalism."
POLITICS_QUENTIN_ROOSEVELT_DESC:0 "The youngest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt, Quentin's early life was groomed for political activism in his father's Republican Party. Quentin, however, wished to be a pilot, and was injured in his training in 1918. Seeing his family and country being torn apart in recent years, Quentin pushed into politics and served as New York's Senator during the fateful year of 1936. Now that the great national disaster is over, Quentin's plan to follow in his father's footsteps and push for a new American Fair Deal."
POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC:0 "As Herbert Hoover's vice president, Charles Curtis is one of the most recognizable faces in America. His protectionism and moderation on social issues would have made him a more than acceptable choice in normal times, but these are not normal times. Regardless, as the times have changed, so too has Charles Curtis, and he has emerged with a plan to address the crises facing the country. Now that he is president, Curtis will attempt to both continue Hoover's legacy and implement "Home Rule Negotiations" in an attempt to solve the political crisis. On the economic front, new tariffs and a work sharing plan are what Curtis believes the country needs to get back on track. His status as the nation's first Native American president and his poor health alike have been largely ignored, with attention instead being placed on his economic plans. The people cry out for help, and if Curtis is unable to address their concerns, the country will suffer greatly. However, if Curtis does succeed in restoring order, he will usher in a new era of prosperity that will redeem the Republican Party and enshrine him as one of America's all-time greatest presidents."
POLITICS_ALF_LANDON_DESC:0 "Alf Landon was a successful entrepreneur in the oil business long before his entry into politics. This self-starter led to the creation of the United States Oil and Gas Association, a lobbying group associated with Standard Oil that Landon remains attached to this day. What initially seemed like a poor decision to break with Hoover's non-intervnetionalist position at the 11th hour before election day turned to his advantage when the Republican Party came with him. Even Hoover has begrudgingly come to endorse Landon, despite this personal betrayal of confidence. Now despite his humble demeanour Landon has proven to be the soft voice of confident economic recovery that America wanted. Although his strong ties with the oil lobby makes him an enemy of both socialists and Longists."
POLITICS_WENDELL_WILLKIE_DESC:0 "Wendell Willkie has been many things in his life before presidency. He began as a William Jennings fan, a populist-minded Democrat. He became a socialist in college, and rumors persist that he seduced Soong Mei Ling during a diplomatic visit to China in 1933. Not to mention an affair with writer Irita Van Doren. He continued to stand out when he opposed Democrats to push for a bank holiday when the Great Depression hit. This support for financial institutions and his assertions that government aid should not interfere with market competition made the difference in his election campaign. There is also his support for integrating the civil service and armed forces, which has put him at odds with many other Democrats. It remains to be seen whether this multitalented man can handle the many roles of the presidency."
POLITICS_HARRY_BYRD_DESC:0 "Whereas many southern populists fell to Huey Long's charms and deserted the Democratic Party, Harry F. Byrd stood his ground. Harry Byrd was born into a Virginian Brahmin family with a direct line to the American Revolution. A firm believer in segregation and fiscally conservative policies intended to reduce the national debt. Holding firm to his anti-Keynesian policies, Harry Byrd won as the stabilizing image of American traditional establishment."
POLITICS_PHILIP_FOLLETTE_DESC:0 "A professional Wisconsin progressive, Philip is the most successful of the politically active La Follette family. A friend and former mentor to Floyd Olson, who had been convinced to join the Farmer Labor Party in order to continue to help his state in need. With the spectre of isolationism that Philip's father Robert stood for, Philip nonetheless stands behind the need for a strong military in the Americas as well as the full extent and strength of the government as promoted by the Farmer Labor Party."
POLITICS_HENRY_WALLLACE_DESC:0 "Humble beginnings as an Iowa farmer did not dissuade a young Henry Wallace from seeing the world and gaining worldly insight. His fortune came from inventing hybrid corn breeds, a major innovation that allowed Wallace him travel the world. Henry visited India and became acquainted with Theosophy, a Hinduist school of thought popular in Russia that draws elements from Christian Anarchism and Socialism. These teachings ultimately alienated him from mainstream socialism and pushed him into the Farmer Labor Party when he returned. Wallace portrays himself above all else a pragmatic economist and an agricultural expert capable of the agrarian reform America needs."
POLITICS_JAMES_MURRAY_DESC:0 "A great controversy surrounded the election of James E. Murray during his election campaign. Tabloids and Republicans all came at Murray claiming that he cannot run for President due to being born in Canada. The truth of these statements may never be known, but his life prior to attending NYU is shrouded in mystery. His life began in earnest when Murray won the Governorship of Montana in 1933. His term as a Democrat was marked by an unusually cooperate relationship with unions and his bold belief that economic reform must disrupt a market if the market is failing."
POLITICS_ALBEN_BARKLEY_DESC:0 "Alben draws from over thirty years of political experience within the Democrat party and his own smart judgement. While Alben supported Wilson's reforms, he opposed McAdoo's attempts to reverse those policies. After several failed national election bids and a steady voting record, Alben was the right piece on the chess board in this election to gain the White House for the Democrats."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "The final ascent into the White House by Richard Russell Jr. is the final stroke in a long game that extends even before his time in the Democrat party. Russell Jr. has accumulated the right combination of titles in the US Navy, in the Georgian House of Representatives, and the US Congress to secure universal respect. His focus that de-segregation should happen entirely on southern terms proved popular with a national audience. Time will tell whether this position is sustainable."
POLITICS_GLEN_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Being President was just as much a surprise to Glen Taylor as it was to the voting public. The man that had wanted at one point to be a wandering preacher and then a country singer had finally reached a position that befitted his skills. Taylor was known in Congress as a compassionate economist and advocate of progressive policies and singing to children on the steps of the Capitol. Taylor's compassion fuled his opposition to segregation, and despite his eccentricities he has endeared himself to the American people, which is all he ever wanted."
POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "Dewey the natural born leader and politician that made it in New York despite his Michigan upbringing. Dewey has continuously proven his assertions correct, including predicting a war in Europe, Asia, and the Americas in the 1930s. His assertions that the New Deal wouldn't be owed entirely to the Republicans was also proven correct. Dewey campaigned under 'Compassionate Capitalism' and tried to distance the reforms from being necessarily welfare. Finally, Dewey's bold prediction that he would win the election came true."
POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC:0 "Young Earl Warren thought his career was doomed when his father Mathias was blacklisted for joining a strike, but instead it motivated the young man into excelling past this stigma. This prior stigma motivated Earl into joining numerous fraternities and lodges in order to intermingle with the people that stigmatized his father, as well as serving in the military. These connections paid off and sent Earl into a life of public service and eventually reached the Governor seat of California in 1932, where he steered the declining Progressive movement towards the political centre away from the even more declining West Coast Socialist Party. Earl became a progressive entryist within the Republican party, pushing for national desegregation."
POLITICS_CHARLES_MCNARY_DESC:0 "Charles McNary stood behind the foundation of the Republican party when it was under attack from all angles in 1936. A Progressive at heart but also a pragmatist, McNary was seen within the party as an insurance against the Northwest descending into radicalism, which also made him allies with an ally of Entente interests in North America. In fact, his company provided electricity to a significant portion of Western Canada by the 1940s due to this relationship."
POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "Harry Truman's dream of glory in war was dashed when the UC choose to prolong their neutrality during the Weltkrieg. Truman had dropped his college and law degree to prepare himself for the conflict that never came. Continued active service in Central America informed him of the threats of insurgent guerilla warfare. Truman brought this this discipline in the face of chaotic warfare back to Missouri and helped the state as Senator relieve towns that were struck by the chaos of 1936. For this Truman was promoted within the Democratic Party, and supported the New Deal legislation. Most strikingly was his push against the conservatives in favour of military desegregation."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Coming from a prominent business family with ties to international trade, William Harriman was able to establish several successful businesses in New York and became an important player in interstate trade. As the federal government has jurisdiction over those transactions, Harriman joined the Department of Commerce. A tactical minded approach to foreign policy and the goal of promoting America's ideology against the radicals that threatened her abroad resonated with Americans and pushed his career upwards."
POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "The decision by Strom to turn the Conservative Manifesto into a raison d’état for the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party was a risky move. Strom had spent decades within the Democratic Party attempting to oppose the overreaching powers of the Federal Government, and ensuring that the party never officially endorse desegregation. This gamble has now paid off as Strom Thurmond has been elected President."
POLITICS_HAPPY_CHANDLER_DESC:0 "The turning point in Happy Chandler's career came during his intermission in politics to become the Commissioner of Baseball. A term as Governor had established Chandler as a respectable and industrious Democrat with a firm hand on the party line. This stint as Commissioner of Baseball saw a historical decision to allow integrated baseball teams, which led to the end of segregated baseball. This only further elevated Chandler as a Senator and made his decision to carry this support into the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party even more important. His insistence that fiscal conservatism and the race question were not tied together stood against Strom Thurmond's line..."
POLITICS_JOHN_BRICKER_DESC:0 "An advocate for limited executive power and a non-interventionist interpretation, John Bricker is as old fashioned a Republican as they come. Bricker's career prior to his presidency was that of a rabble raiser and dissenter within the Republican Party railing against suspected socialist sympathizers and opposing the use of executive power to push economic reform. The country as a whole having come close to populist or authoritarian dictatorships just a few years prior."
POLITICS_HAROLD_STASSEN_DESC:0 "While the senior Republican Party leadership like Willkie and Dewey had preoccupied the 1930s with the minutia of the 1936 crisis, Harold Stassen was serving in the US Navy and being exposed into the wider world. An important lesson learned is the importance of international cooperation as opposed to the tariffs that his fellow Republicans were pushing for. A firm opponent of international syndicalism, Stassen believes that laissez faire economic policies must be replaced by strategic economic cooperation There is no need to hold onto undemocratic institutions such as segregation which only feeds syndicalist arguments."
POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "A student of warfare in the famous Class of 1915, Eisenhower's initial enthusiasm for testing new military doctrines vanished in Central America, as generals there failed to win against poorly trained insurgencies. While others in this class fell to either the urge for dictatorship or radicalism. Eisenhower stood firm with the Federal government and tried to stay out of civilian politics. Quoted as saying that he wouldn’t want to any politician, from 'dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe' Four years after he made that statement, Eisenhower was being sworn in as President. This came from a national acceptance for the desegregation of the military Eisenhower oversaw."
POLITICS_ADLAI_STEVENSON_DESC:0 "The reputation of Adlai Stevenson's father, that of an isolationist, dogged Adlai Stevenson II well into his political career. This position among the Democrats was put to the test with the American First Party, which depleted the party rank. Adlai stood to his roots during this most contentious time and persevered. As Governor of Illinois Adlai reformed the police force to be less at odds with socialists and even defended their rights to organize in the face of the Red Scare. Most doubted Adlai's ability to win against the respected General Eisenhower, but through an in kind appreciation from socialist voters Adlai won in the end."
POLITICS_JOHN_SPARKMAN_DESC:0 "Born in a log cabin and raised on a farm, John Sparkman had a very relatable upbringing. A rapidly ascending legal career and political clubs later and Sparkman had become the Democratic Representative for Huntsville. His victory being especially important in the fateful Year of 36 as he beat the AFP's candidate. Sparkman was instrumental in opening education up to immigrants and women in the South. Silent on social matters and bolstered by his support of science education, Sparkman spoke out against defensive US foreign policy, and eventually left for the Constitution Party, where his reputation put him on the fast track to presidency."
#Actually James Eastland not Harry Cain
POLITICS_HARRY_CAIN_DESC:0 "Son of the Mississippi Delta District Attorney, James Eastland was sidetracked from politics for the first three decades in order to run a plantation. An advocate of sharecropping who profited from their work until his plantation quadrupled in size. Eastland stood up in the Senatorial race against the Klan's candidate, and won. Against the Conservative Coalition, Eastman supported the Fair Deal legislation in his home state while voting for it in Congress. As his reputation and passage into the Constitution Party carried much weight, he successfully lead many Democratic voters to his campaign as the closest thing the party could offer to a national candidate."
POLITICS_CULBERT_OLSON_DESC:0 "Culbert Olson had faced both the stigma of running as a Mormon politician, and running as an atheist in his lifetime. In California as Governor, Culbert had to deal with long standing rumors that Mormons had a blood feud with the US Government. Olson's superb term as Governor in passing health care legislation and allowing non-SPA socialists to organize. By the time of the national race, Culbert had come out as an atheist, and faced a second uphill battle. The party stood by him, and ultimately his portfolio allowed him to reach the White House."
POLITICS_EMMETT_ANDERSON_DESC:0 "Hailing from Tacoma, Washington, Emmett T. Anderson was a successful printmaker before politics. During the Crisis of 36, Emmett ensured that presses for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer got out during the strike in Seattle. Emmett also ran his own pamphlets during the crisis decrying the Seattle Democrats as allies of the Silver Legion, and pressed to a peaceful end to the strike. After this the Republican Party got wind, and Emmett was elected to Congress. Eventually his actions were taken up on a national level by Republicans, and became a rallying cry against Democrats that made the difference during the election."
POLITICS_JOHN_GELLATLY_DESC:0 "From bankruptcy in Benton County, Oregon, John Arthur Gellatly distinguished himself as a responsible fiscal conservative. After being elected to Washington State Senate in 1918, Gellatly made several runs for Governor throughout the 1920s and 30s, finally succeeding as Lieutenant Governor during the Crisis of 36. The foundation of the Pacific states required a reliable and uncontroversial Republican candidate, and Gellatly was their man."
POLITICS_HOWARD_HUGES_DESC:0 "Son of an All-American family of ministers and inventors, Howard Hughes broke out of the Midwest by demonstrating a knack for engineering. After the tragic death of his parents, young Howard was thrust into a family fortune and a medical facility in Maryland. Using this vast fortune, Howard created the Summa Tool Corporation, a maker of fine industrial tools. The proceeds were funneled into Howard's Hollywood scripts, including the Academy Award winner 'The World Is Yours'. Expanding finally into Republican politics in California, Howard stood out among a crowd of old money. From RKO to a line of passenger aircraft, Howard was elected under the promise to finish Boulder Dam in Colorado and electrify the states."
POLITICS_FRANK_MERRIAM_DESC:0 "Son of Civil War veterans, Frank Merriam was born in Iowa and planned for a legal career in the Midwest. Upon seeing the rising prominence of the California Republican Party, Frank shifted his career out west. It was Merriam more than anyone that defeated the SPA in California, defeating the Longshoremen strike, and even rebuffing Upton Sinclair when he became the Democrat nominee for Governor. Despite this, traditionally Republican papers resisted Merriam's tax reforms. Upon the ascension of MacArthur, most of these papers were ordered by Hearst to decry all Republicans. Merriam was able to use the public outcry against Hearst and MacArthur to gain the executive seat."
POLITICS_FLETCHER_BOWRON_DESC:0 "A California native and veteran of the Nicaragua War, Fletcher Bowron has a unique relationship with Latin Americans among Republican politicians. The first mayor of Los Angeles to support Cinco De Mayo parades, and an advocate of imprisoning radicals on suspicion. This coupled with Bowron's pursuit of organized crime impressed hardline republicans enough to put him in a greater office."
POLITICS_ROBERT_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Robert Taylor Jones began as a civil engineer out of Tennessee. The most significant project Jones was on was the Panama Canal. The boom of civil constructions out west drew Jones into Arizona, where he entered Democratic politics on a constructive platform. Serving as Governor of Arizona during the Crisis of 36, Jones countered the SPA and AFP candidates who sought to push the state into rebellion. Sadly, rebellion was forced upon the state when MacArthur came, and several democratic politicians betrayed the republic for autocracy. Thankfully Jones had contact with the true loyal Democratic Party, and campaigned for national office."
POLITICS_CLARENCE_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Clarence Martin came into prominence during a consequential Washington State election of 1932, which unseated many Republicans from state office. Clarence may have come in during a major shift, but his credentials in Washington included fostering small business and his unusually respectful discourse. Clarence on principle refused to exaggerate or appeal to populist tendencies in his election campaign, and distinguished himself in the Washington Senate by sponsoring necessary civil works projects. As the Democratic Party was able to wrest the civil works initiative from Republicans across the West, Clarence reaped the benefits politically and received more votes in 36 than Garner in Washington. The desertion of some Democrats to MacArthur only made Clarence's loyalty stand out, and his nomination to the executive chair that more likely."
POLITICS_OSWALD_WEST_DESC:0 "West was luck that the provisional government set up after MacArthur's rise did not specify natural born Americans, as he was born in Canada. Starting out as a Land Agent for Oregon, Oswald West was always diligent with his work. As Governor, West saw passage of Women's Suffrage, Worker Rights, and even state Prohibition, all strengthening the Democratic Party in the state. Taking the initiative to finance a State highway System without Federal money, West successfully pushed public projects. A more fervent advocate of conservative democratic laws on alcohol and even authorizing sterilisation as punishment for breaking morality codes."
POLITICS_CHARLES_SPRAGUE_DESC:0 "A newspaper magnate and business owner, Sprauge got his start in Oregon politics as a newspaper commentator. Reprinted nationally and famed for his advocacy of small business, internationalisation, and fiscal conservatism, many expected him to enter into Democratic politics. Sprauge instead ran as a Republican, and successfully capture democrat voters who supported a fiscally conservative but active Fair Deal. A surprising number of SPA also voted him into Governorship, as he supported their employment programs. This position he encouraged within the Republican Party, and eventually allowed him to gain support throughout the West."
POLITICS_RALPH_CARR_DESC:0 "A follower of Hoover's Republican Party, Ralph Carr's politics in Colorado were fiscally conservative and socially mixed. While Carr did deploy the National Guard to end the Green Mountain Dam Strike of 36, within the PSA Carr refused to imprison radicals. Going so far as to pardon several AFL labor leaders that were arrested without charges. Ultimately a Constitutionalist in a time of crisis where others were stretching legal boundaries. Carr was able to use this as leverage within the Republican Party to secure nomination and ultimately the election."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_LEE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lee was one of the first hard right Utahan Republicans, being elected only shorty after Mormons were allowed into Congress. While others resisted the draft on religious grounds, Lee joined the military and eventually fell on hard times after veterans’ pensions dried up. Running for Governor as a Republican and promising to promote Veteran Pay, Lee had also become acquainted with the old boys’ network of politics. This old boy’s network almost led to his dismissal after he was caught in an illegal gambling den by pro-AFP sheriff W. Skousen. Lee continued to advocate for fiscal conservatism and for admission of all religious right groups into Republican circles, which eventually got him nominated for the highest office."
POLITICS_MONRAD_WALLGREN_DESC:0 "Wallgren's career prior to politics was a combination of business management and pool sharking. A personable and approachable attitude helped jump-start his political career in Washington, especially during the close election of 36. The State Senate saw Wallgren's take an active role in national security, and advocate restricting press of radical elements, Wallgren stood firm as formerly Democratic papers were blacklisted along with SPA and AFP ones after they began supporting MacArthur. Wallgren's opposition eventually forced him out of the Democratic Party while in office, to which he responded by joining the up-and-coming Progressives."
POLITICS_CLYDE_TINGLEY_DESC:0 "Clyde Tingly came to New Mexico to heal his wife's TB, which was worsening in the Ohio weather. Tingly became incensed at the Republican rule in New Mexico, and so began a career in politics and advocacy for health-care reform. A supporter of early Fair Deal proposals, Tingly flew into office on the promise that a new governorship would allow for better usage of state funds. Albuquerque began recovering from the Great Depression under tingly even as most of the nation fell further, and his dedication to health care legislation pushed him into national politics where he became a Progressive."
POLITICS_ARTHUR_LANGLIE_DESC:0 "After a decade on the Seattle City Council. and another four years in the State Senate, Arthur Langlie was one of the youngest nationally recognized politicians in Washington history. Running against and losing to Monrad Wallgren, Langlie recouped and ultimately ingratiated himself into the Republican Party enough to win the nomination. Seen by many as a common man and exemplifier of the immigrant spirit, Langlie answers the Progressive claims to represent immigrant rights."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MCKAY_DESC:0 "Beginning work before he was out of High School, McKay thought his apex would be a used car dealership in Salem, Oregon. Instead, the Republican party encouraged him to run for local and then state offices, eventually being elected to the State Senate in 36. This climactic year saw McKay willingly leave his old supporters behind for the Progressives. An advocate for the national highway system, fiscally moderate Fair Deal policies, and a support for public works has moderated some of the Progressives more radical elements, and helped them take liberal Republican voting districts."
POLITICS_DANIEL_THORNTON_DESC:0 "Active in the 4-H and agrarian rights program, Daniel Thornton moved to Colorado from Texas in order to run a cattle ranch. A brief career in the State Senate combined with his strong personality made his campaign as a Republican to Governorship fairly easy. Known for his Stetson hat, cowboy boots, and smoking pipe, many reports have called Thornton the 'Republican Garner'. The media seemed to place him at odds with Richard Nixon during the election, but their mutual understanding to allow the elder politician to run made the difference at the end."
POLITICS_BOURKE_HICKENLOOPER_DESC:0 "Coming to the West after MacArthur's coup, Bourke initially had very little public support within the provisional government. Partnered with J. William Fullbright, Bourke helped the Republicans whip into shape, and pushed for an isolationist policy towards Canada and Japan. Seen by many as a patriot of a country on the brink of dissolution, Bourke won office by assuring a hard stand against all traitors to the American Republic."
POLITICS_VICTOR_MEYERS_DESC:0 "A multi-talented if not disparate man, Victor Meyers has been called the 'Pagliacci of Politics' in his early days. Back when his political career competed with his musical career. Insisting that the Democrats oppose Prohibition in Washington, he rode aboard a beer wagon during his Gubernatorial campaign. After this failed he began mixing Progressive policies with his natural talent to draw attention to himself. Promising tribes across the West voting rights, advocating pensions, child welfare and unemployment pay, Meyers was at times taken seriously and other times laughed at. A unique proposal for building single-pour concrete housing to solve the homeless issue proved to be both eccentric and effective. Ultimately the Progressives and the American people took him seriously enough to elect him into office."
POLITICS_ANDREW_HOCKENHULL_DESC:0 "A quiet and unassuming politician, Hockenhull rose through the ranks of New Mexican politics through his strong adherence to the Democratic Party line. So, his switch to the Progressive Party in 1928 was a pragmatic switch. Although he did not win the Governorship in 1936, Hockenhull persisted in the public service until the Progressives were forced to run him."
POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "A native Californian and an obstinate quaker, Nixon attempted to join the FBI after college. After failing to do so, Nixon became a lawyer for the major oil companies of California. Nixon began a feud with fellow Republican Earl Warren, which persisted into the national political scene. Nixon took jobs prosecuting politicians in the Pacific States who were suspected of radicalism, and had a good winning record against socialists. Finally Nixon defeated Warren within the Republicans by promising him the Governorship of California in exchange for the National Nomination."
POLITICS_GEORGE_CRAIG_DESC:0 "Born in Brazil, Indiana, and trained to be a lawyer, George Craig was classmates with his eventual electoral rival, William Jenner. Craig would eventually compete with Jenner for the Republican Party nomination after his service during the Crisis of 36. Craig's service constituted defending the American Legion of Clay County against the SPA, which informed his later anti-socialism. As Governor of Indiana, Craig reformed the state government, and refused funds for the national highway in favour of local contractors."
POLITICS_VAL_PETERSON_DESC:0 "A school administrator in Nebraska for the first twenty years of his career, Peterson's introduction into politics came when he entered the US Air Force, and was assigned to trained with Hugh Butler. Butler eventually recommended him to Nebraska Governor Dwight Griswold. Peterson succeeded Griswold as Governor, and worked his way up the Republican Party power structure. Eisenhower recognized a fellow soldier and elevated Peterson within the Party, where he became a nationally recognized politician and presidential candidate."
POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "A life filled with difficulty prior to his ascent into office, John Winant's fortunes turned often. From dropping out of Princeton due to inability to pay, to the US Air Service. His military rank had distinguished himself enough to be elected Governor of New Hampshire, while also losing his remaining fortune in the Great Depression. Made Ambassador to Canada, Winant became torn between his duty and an affair with MP Churchill's daughter Sarah. This relationship was broken off, and ultimately his contacts in Canada made his election to the Liberals surer. The chaos of 36 continues to press upon Winant's mind however."
POLITICS_HERBERT_LEHMAN_DESC:0 "As of his inauguration, Herbert Lehman is the first Jewish Head of State in American History. Born into the storied Lehman family, and served in the US Army general staff, Lehman got his start supporting Al Smith's presidential campaign. Lehman served the rest of FDR's term after his death in 1921, and subsequent terms as Governor. Lehman opposed the conservative wing of the Democrats and opposed Eastland while addressing Congress. The Crisis of 36 forced Lehman out of NYC and into the provisional capital of Boston, where his shrewd dealings allowed him to secure safe passage of refugees into New England from the CSA."
POLITICS_PERCIVAL_BAXTER_DESC:0 "A sentry for Maine Republicanism, Percival Baxter has stood against radicalism in his state for decades. Baxter's term as Senator saw a massive expansion to national parks in Maine, and successfully kept the lands free during the Depression. In 1936, Baxter banished several Republicans from the party after uncovering their Klan membership. The rise of MacArthur saw Baxter pushed into New Englander politics, where he represented a return to normal non-radical republican politics."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_KENNEDY_DESC:0 "Born into an Irish Catholic family in Boston, which placed the Kennedy's just out of reach of the political elite. Joseph Kennedy was guided into Harvard to achieve as high a prominence as possible from his birth. Family troubles like the lobotomy of his eldest daughter was pushed aside in favour of dynasty building and business growth. Kennedy owned the largest whiskey importation company in America, and reinvested profits into businesses that sadly fell in the Great Depression. The Crisis of 36 and the reorganisation of New England allowed Kennedy to rally the Democratic voters to his side, becoming the first Catholic Head of State in American history."
POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_HERTER_DESC:0 "Born in Paris, and moving to Boston at a young age, Herter came into wealth via marriage to the Pratt family. Sent to the German Embassy, Herter would frequently recommend America intervene in the Weltkreig to no avail. His return saw him becoming Governor of Massachusetts, and the establishment of essential diplomatic ties with Canada that came into play in 37. Herter continues to advocate America's entry into the Entente, the liberation of democratic France, and the final justice of dismantling the German Empire."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Among the Republican establishment in the Northeast, Joe Martin Jr. had the most sway. Beginning as a newspaper editor of the Boston Evening Chronicle, Martin was elected to the State Senate. Martin fought gerrymandering by the Democrats and eventually joined the Republican National Committee in 1936. Just in time for the nation to collapse. Martin rallied conservative Republicans who opposed Reed and Long's expansion of federal powers and ultimately opposed MacArthur's usurper Democrats. This allowed him to gain the upper hand on New England Democrats and win the snap election."
POLITICS_NORMAN_WALLACE_LERMOND_DESC:0 "A man equally concerned with nature and politics, Norman Wallace Lermond has had a long history with both. From 1880, he became involved in farmers organizations, the Populist Party, and even founded the Socialist Party of Maine in the 1890's. Though his later attempts to start a utopian socialist colony in Washington state were unsuccessful, Lermond came back to New England and built the socialist movement in the region, though it was never directly tied to syndicalism. Instead, Lermond is influenced by Bellamyist ideals, and hopes to bring these ideals to bear in New England. With such a diverse array of influences, Lermond will surely make for a unique leader, but if he wants to keep New England alive, he will have to choose his allies carefully..."
POLITICS_LEONARD_ABBOTT_DESC:0 "Having mixed ties to Britain and America, Leonard Abbott has had a conflicted life. However, when he moved to the United States to be a newspaper editor, he faced discrimination as an anarchist. Seeing the successful revolution in Britain and believing in the possibility of a similar uprising in the states, Abbott aligned himself with other prominent syndicalist thinkers in the Red Belt and elsewhere. However, due to his ties in New England, Abbott decided to stay in the region to attempt to hold an uprising and bring New England into the fold of the Combined Syndicates. Now that he has succeeded in this goal, it is only a matter of time before New England joins its larger western neighbor. May all traitors and reactionaries tremble at the combined forces of these two regions..."
POLITICS_DENNIS_ROBERTS_DESC:0 "A quiet but integral member to the Democratic establishment, his cooperation with the Canadian Liberal party saw his rise through a Canadian sponsored election campaign. This campaign emphasized his loyalty to Rhode Island, his Naval service, and his voting record in favour of civil rights."
POLITICS_PETER_GERRY_DESC:0 "A protégé' of MP Lyon Mackenzie King, great grandson of VP Elbridge Gerry, and inheritor to a vast fortune, Gerry already had a leg up in politics. Becoming the Democratic Whip in the 1920s while a Senator for Rhode Island, Gerry worked his way up the political and social ladder. Marrying into and gaining the support of the Vanderbilt family helped Garry finance bailouts for Rhode Island businesses. MP King convinced Gerry to join the Liberals in 1940 in order to advance their common interest in social liberalism, which eventually paid off in his presidential campaign."
POLITICS_SHERMAN_ADAMS_DESC:0 "A career that spans Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and ultimately the executive chair. Serving as the Republican Speaker of the House in 1940, Sherman pushed through Old Age Pensions laws and worked towards a balanced budget Fair Deal road-map. This ultimately proved popular with Americans after decades of indecisive economic policy, and was used heavily in Sherman's presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ROBERT_BRADFORD_DESC:0 "A Republican in a strongly Democratic Massachusetts, Bradford's combination of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism helped make the case for his term as Governor in 1938. There Bradford successfully prevented strikes from going violent and used public funds to build homes to solve the housing issue. Bradford chaired a Silent Guest program during the turmoil of 36, asking Americans to donate the cost of a meal to the public relief for refugees from Macarthur. This charitable attitude continues into his term in the executive office."
POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Tobin's career nearly ended when he was indicted for malpractice that caused the Coconut Grove fire of 1938. Tobin was charged with refusing to allow a club to be closed in order for safety measures to be installed. Tobin learned from this tragic mistake and became a rare Democratic supporter of unions. The union vote helped elevate Tobin within the Democratic Party, where he protected organisation rights, and worked this into a reconciliation position during his national campaign."
POLITICS_PAUL_DEVER_DESC:0 "As a lawyer, Dever made a career in Boston defending business practices of corporations. This all changed when Dever enlisted in the US Army, and served alongside mixed race divisions. As he found out that most of these soldiers were in the Liberal party, Dever entered into politics under the Liberals. An uphill battle against Democrats in Massachusetts commenced that saw Dever promise veteran benefits and welfare extension."
POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Aiken, the stalwart Republican and advocate of state-controlled Fair Deal legislation. Aiken in the State Congress passed laws to protect debtors during the Great Depression from losing their all-in debt collection. As Governor, Aiken instituted a pay-as-you go system for road maintenance that worked better than Fair Deal highways in New Hampshire. As a result, Aiken was chosen to run for the party nomination against conservative Republicans."
POLITICS_THOMAS_HART_DESC:0 "An admiral during the inter-war period, Hart had built a reputation of personal bravery and the ability to manoeuvre among politicians stateside. Manoeuvring helped by his marriage of his daughter into the Wilson political family. Ultimately Hart decided to run in national elections as a Democrat, appealing to the impoverished voting base of his native Connecticut."
POLITICS_CHARLES_POLETTI_DESC:0 "Unlike some of his more privileged Republican counterparts at Harvard, Democrat Charles Poletti was not born into one of the leading WASP families of the Northeast. The son of Italian immigrants, Poletti attended college on a scholarship, waiting tables to pay for textbooks. Quickly moving up the ranks of the Democratic party, Polletti's rustic charm enamored him with working-class voters across the country. Now President, Poletti has an ambitious reform agenda of racial integration, expanding welfare, and an aggressive anti-syndicalist international stance. Whether his domestic reforms will earn the support of his more conservative counterparts remains to be seen, however."
POLITICS_NELSON_ROCKEFELLER_DESC:0 "While some pundits are saying the name 'Rockefeller' alone catapulted Nelson to the presidency, Rockefeller's ascendancy to the highest office in the land was no given. Ivy League-educated, and initially working mainly in the business world, the radicalism among other Republican candidates encouraged Nelson to run for the presidency as a check on his more extreme counterparts. Using his family network to seize control of the nomination, Rockefeller's progressive approaches to health-care, welfare, and the economy may be the key to helping unite a divided country."
POLITICS_HENRY_LODGE_JR_DESC:0 "Born into a prominent political dynasty with roots in both New Jersey and Massachusetts, it was no surprise that Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. decided to enter national politics. With a strong family network to rely on, he quickly built a strong power base among the powerful WASP families of the Northeast, catapulting him to the Republican nomination, and now the presidency. More moderate and diplomatic than other Republican candidates, it remains to be seen which direction he will take America in internationally..."
POLITICS_OWEN_BREWSTER_DESC:0 "Hailing from the quiet forests of Maine, Owen Brewster has emerged as a national leader in the anti-syndicalist movement. While initially supporting Huey Long and the AFP in the early 1930's, Long's rejection of the Klan, close allies of Brewster, led to him rejoin the Republican party. Brewster is infamous in Maine, and across the country, for his open courting of the Klan, who were influential in his early gubernatorial and Senate victories. Now President of a divided America, it remains to be seen whether he can reconcile his divisive past with a new view for the future..."
POLITICS_STYLES_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Formerly a teacher, Styles Bridges became the youngest governor in America when he emerged victorious in the 1932 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Bridges then entered the Senate, earning a name as a ruthless anti-Syndicalist, not above using blackmail, treachery, and deceit to achieve his goals. In one of the most infamous incidents of the early 1930s, launched a major slander campaign in an attempt to label a leading SPA Senator as a 'rampant and notorious homosexual' and a 'traitor to the moral values of our nation'. This sensationalist attack earned him the enmity of Reed and the SPA, but enamored him with those opposed to Syndicalism. Now President, Bridges can turn his attention to stopping Syndicalism around the globe."
POLITICS_HIRAM_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "Born in the mid-century in Sacremento, California, Hiram Johnson came from a political family. Hiram's father, Grove Johnson, was a disgraced state representative, his mother was heavily involved in the Daughters of the American Revolution. Hiram's early political career was boosted by this legacy, and he became a competent DA for San Francisco in 1902. Hiram's gubernatorial race in 1910 was funded by the liberal Republican group 'the Lincoln-Roosevelt League' Johnson's campaign ran in opposition to the Southern Pacific Railroad corporation, who sought to lobby within the Republicans against Hiram. As Governor, Hiram supported anti immigration bills, and paved the way for a later Congressional career. The Republican estabilshment in California was rocked in 1932, when Hiram threw in his support for Herbert Hoover. Hiram's personal distaste for the Eastern Establishment meant he stayed away from the political chaos of 1936."
POLITICS_GEORGE_NORRIS_DESC:0 "George W. Norris was the 11th son of poor Ohioan farmers, yet grew up to accomplish many great deeds, and eventually gain America’s Highest Office. After graduating university, Norris went into practicing law in Nebraska. While in Nebraska Norris became active in the local Republican Party and eventually ran for a seat in the U.S House of Representatives. While a representative, Norris stood with Roosevelt and championed many progressive causes. Eventually becoming a Senator, Norris held little faith to the Party over his ideals, and regularly attacked causes that his own party favoured if it went against his ideals. With America collapsing around him, Norris knew that Hoover could not fix the mess in America, and if America was to be saved, he had to do it without the Republicans. With that, Norris broke from the Republicans and joined with the Progressives, and despite all odds won the Presidency. Now, Norris will have the tremendous responsibility of holding America together and guiding her to a brighter future. "
POLITICS_IRENEE_DU_PONT:0 "Irénée du Pont, descended from the influential du Pont Family was primed for being an influential figure in the region of New England, yet the type of influence he would exert never became clear until America fell apart at the seems. From 1919 to 1925 he was the president of the Du Pont chemical company, he resigned his position after eight workers were poisoned, something to which he responded with "Only slight difficulties have been encountered". Du Pont eventually joined with the “Sentinels of the Republic”, a group that started as a lobbying form against government intervention and socialism yet transformed into a militant group influenced by Alfred Sloan’s ideas of unrestrained capitalism. When the Federalists gained control of New England, the Sentinels and the Remnants acted against the government, eventually storming congress and forming a new government, one headed by Du Pont. Now, Du Pont and his far-right allies’ rule New England superficially and with the help of their aligned militias, while the rest of the nation truly breathes free without a government to breathe down their necks."
POLITICS_LOTHROP_STODDARD_DESC:0 "Lothrop Stoddard began his life in Massachusetts, and from an early age, he displayed an exceptional intellect. When he was old enough, Stoddad attented Harvard University, earning the 'magna cum laude' distinction and working towards a Ph.D. in History. After he achieved this, he joined several historical and political organizations and began his work as an author, espousing eugenicist and racialist views to explain what he sees as the current decline of civilization. Despite his background in history and political science, Stoddard is a great admirer of biology. He believes it is the key to explaining the relationship between the different human races as well as being the causal factor in the United States's current woes. As such, his writings are characterized by both political and scientific views, mostly on the topics of race and genetic superiority. Stoddard's popularity as an author greatly aided his efforts in joining the political arena, and though he is seen as occupying the political fringe, his work is familiar in almost every home in New England. Now that he is in charge of the country, Stoddard has power he never expected to possess, and he plans to use it to save human civilization itself."
POLITICS_JOHN_MCGROARTY_DESC:0 "Born at Buck Mountain, Pennsylvania during the Fall of 1862 as the youngest of 12 Children, McGroarty was never assumed to be anyone of importance, but fate works in mysterious ways. McGorarty began a career in Law before beginning a career as an executive in a Montanan Mining Company before moving once again to Los Angeles to become a Journalist. After becoming famed for his introspective writing on Lincoln and the black community, McGroarty began authoring everything from books to plays to dramas until being elected to Congress in the 1930s for the Democratic Party. McGroarty would run for President in 1936 to only fail miserably in the nominations, due to Garner and with his failure to become his Vice Presidential nominee, McGroarty would decide to quit politics and return to Journalism in California. Before McGroarty could settle down however, the 2nd American Civil War kicked off and he decided to once again get back into politics. Running with the Democratic Party again, McGroarty was able to sweep the nominations and be elected to the highest office in all the land. Though McGroarty has campaigned on a promise of Hope and Unity, it is unknown whether he can deliver on those promises."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RANDOLPH_HEARST_DESC:0 "The influence that William Randolph Hearst holds over America can not be understated. He is the head of one of America’s largest newspapers and can change public opinion on his own whims. His tactics of sensationalism and “Yellow Journalism” have put him in the center of the publishing industry and has gained him many political points. Indeed, his influence extends deep into politics as well, enough to earn him the presidency of the Pacific States. Originally, he sided with Progressive ideals, but eventually drifted right, now as President his National Democratic Party has instituted authoritarian and right-wing measures, and many fear that Hearst is close to becoming a dictator."
POLITICS_L_RON_HUBBARD_DESC:0 "To some, Hubbard is a messiah, to others he is a madman, but regardless Hubbard is one thing: powerful. Hubbard came from humble beginnings, eventually finding work publishing for pulp fiction magazines, where he wrote many genres, mainly science fiction. After a near-death experience he published “Excalibur”, which originally failed to gain any mainstream popularity. However, during the chaos of the Spiritualist Coup Hubbard took a place right by the side of Edward Longstreet Bodin, a man who shared many of his radical beliefs. Hubbard’s influence grew within the part until he eventually gained the highest level of leadership in the land when Ed Bodin was killed by a crazed Syndicalist gunman. Many still think that Hubbard organized his killing, but that matters little now. Hubbard is in charge and will guide the human race to a higher plane of existence."
POLITICS_EDWARD_LONGSTREET_BODIN_DESC:0 "Edward Longstreet Bodin is a mysterious man, but as the leader of the Spiritualist Movement, some would argue he has to be. His birth in 1894 came, in his view, as the culmination of a family history originating in the sixteenth century French demonologist Jean Bodin. The younger Bodin has always shown a fascination with such subjects, as well as the paranormal and extraterrestrial. His ideas have manifested themselves in his "Spiritualist Party" which, while on the fringe of American politics, has attracted a passionate following. Bodin has taken advantage of the recent state of chaos in America to elbow his way into the political arena, stepping on many but meeting a curious ally along the way. L. Ron Hubbard has become a sort of right-hand-man to Bodin, and with the help of Japanese sympathizers, the two men hope to exorcise the twin demons of Syndicalism and Anglo-Monarchism in America and soon, the world. Bodin will have to take care, though: the diverse factions he has so adeptly unified into one party could just as quickly dissolve into infighting not unlike the kind seen on the national stage."

BBR_WEB_DUBOIS_POLITICS_DESC:0 "From an early day, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois would fight for equality, fight against intolerance, and go to any means for his beliefs. He grew up in a small integrated community in Massachusetts and attended university and eventually became a professor. Du Bois was one of the founders of the NCAAP, and one of the leaders of the Niagara Group, a group that opposed Booker Washington’s Atlanta Compromise. However, this would be just a page in his lifelong fight for equality, as throughout he fought against Lynchings, Jim Crow laws, and other discriminatory practices. He used his prominence as an author to spread his message to the wider world, with many regarding his work as cornerstones in the fight for Civil Rights all across America. Yet as the nation fell apart, the civil rights dilemma fell on deaf ears to the establishment. And with the outbreak of Civil War, it became clear that equality would not be came by peacefully. As the Black Belt uprising took hold over the South, Du Bois took hold over the new state, and will now call upon his countrymen to fight for equality, justice and their lives. "
BBR_FATHER_DIVINE_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Even to his supporters, Reverend M. J. Divine comes off as a strange man, a man who claimed to be God Himself. Yet, despite all of his various eccentricities his Peace Party is now in charge of the Black Belt Republic, were he seeks to unite the nation under tolerance and peace. Little is known about his early life, with people only being able to guess at his date and location of birth, as well as his birth name. Throughout his life he was sentenced to prison many times, committed to mental asylums, and declared as a madman, though most of these arrests were on baseless claims. Yet he and his followers persevered, following Father Divine and his unique church around America, even as the nation collapsed. His charisma and style of preaching turning his congregation from a disorganized and small group of Black Patrons to a massive interracial congregation. And along with James F. Jones, he founded the peace party, the party that eventually took over the Black Belt Republic. Now he will lead his countrymen to the future, no matter what it may bring. "
BBR_CHARLES_YOUNG_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Charles Young was born into slavery yet would go on to free many from oppression. Young attended an all-white high school and graduated at the top of his class, then became a teacher himself before he became a cadet at West Point. While at West point, Young was faced with a slough of discrimination from his peers, yet despite it all he persevered and graduated. He later served with Calvary troops and in various National Parks across America. He was also sent as a Military Attaché to Haiti and Liberia. Young was close to being the first Black Man promoted to Brigadier General, but many white troops did not want to be outranked by an African American. Due to this, president at the time Woodrow Wilson vetoed his promotion; throughout the following years white officers attempted to deny Young his promotion. Throughout the rest of his life Young was faced with discrimination, and when his brethren rose up against oppression, Young was quick to offer his services to the new Black Belt Republic. Now, Young is in charge of the young state and will guide it forward under Rooseveltian and Americanist principles. "
BBR_ELIJAH_MUHAMMAD_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Honourable Elijah Muhammad came from humble beginnings; he had little education, going to work in the factories after age 3. While living in Detroit, he attended rallies for various Black Nationalist organizations, including one with Wallace Fard Muhammad. He taught that African Americans could reclaim their culture and history through self determination, something that a young Elijah Muhammad agreed with considering his own struggles in the South. He became an ardent follower of Fard and his ideology. Eventually Fard turned leadership of the Detroit Chapter over to Muhammad, and had the organization renamed to the “Nation of Islam”. When Fard disappeared, Elijah Muhammad was quick to take leadership of the NOI. As America collapsed and the Black Revolt begun, Muhammad declared to his followers to rise up alongside them. And along with other Black Nationalists, he took over the young state. Now, he will ensure that Black America is gods land, and his people will never again be oppressed by the White Devil. "
BBR_MARCUS_GARVEY_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey is one of the most fervent black nationalists around. The founder of UNIA has some reservations about the Black Belt Republic. But, seeing our willingness to pursue closer ties with Liberia, he has returned to claim the mantle of leadership for our young nation. A separatist at heart, Garvey hopes to create a Pan-African state. Even if he does accomplish this, he still hopes to retain the lands we have fought so hard for. He certainly will not give up the country to socialists, who he loathes more than almost anyone else. His ideology, fittingly termed "Garveyism", has caught on in the Black Belt Republic. Many of our citizens hope to migrate to Africa eventually, but this is a long term goal, and for now, there is still the issue of other American factions to contend with. "

POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"
POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."

POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."
POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."

Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "To some, Lawrence is a New Cromwell, hellbent on shaping England in his dictatorial image. To others, Lawrence is the protector of British Democracy, and the savoir of the nation. Many things can be said about Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg. However, despite people’s views on him, one thing is a fact: His power over Britain is undeniable. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many now fear that his power may go to his head; and he could end up being no better than the man he deposed. "

His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instill in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."

She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."

The council is made by nine members that are elected every six years, which generally are six from the ruling party and three from the opposition.

He was already a political activist when he was in highschool, and took part in the 1904 civil war defending the government of José Battle y Ordoñez. When the war was over, he formed the 'Centro Obrero Socialista' which would start the process of creating the 'Partido Socialista de Uruguay' in 1910, with Frugoni as its general secretary. He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalize, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."

She became the first Uruguayan woman to study medicine when she began her career in the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1900, where she graduated as a physician in 1908.\n\nShe afiliated the Partido Socialista de Uruguay when it was founded in 1910, where she found the place to fight for cultural and civil rights for women in a political platform, and then went on to create the 'Consejo Nacional de la Mujer Uruguaya' and the 'Alianza Uruguaya de Mujeres' in 1919. She later went on to France to specialize in Dermatology and venereal diseases.

In 1920 he was chosen as director of the Partido Nacional and was the president of the CNA from 1925 to 1927.\n\nWhile his reputation is far from perfect, with multiple conflicts with more radical and progressive factions within the PN, he has proven in the past that he has a genuine concern for the well-being of the Uruguayan citizens and workers. Now that he leads Uruguay, he shall focus on reducing government intervention on the economy, improving the agrarian economy instead of industrializing Uruguay and, inspired by Alexis de Tocqueville's writings, increase the local autonomy of each city and town within Uruguay."

POLITICS_LACERDA_TOT_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda was born in 1914, the year the weltkrieg started, and his very name is significant to understand him; Carlos comes from Karl Marx, Frederico from Friedrich Engels, as his father was a socialist activist as well who greatly admired the duo; In time, he followed in his father's footsteps, and joined the CGT and became a full time leftist activist as early as 1932, when he put his law degree on the backseat to focus on the political realm entirely. Long involved in the Demoratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade on the world, and he took an active part on bringing it to his home. Now, has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of former Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state. However, his somewhat aggressive demeanour may result in issues both domestically and abroad when it comes to close negotiations."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVER_RJM_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defense of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key point in the ideologically charged and contentious race. Thrusted into his new position by the liberation of his land, Mangabeira is the first of hopefully many leaders of this relatively young nation, and hopes to create a legacy of equality and prosperity that will contrast with the terrible legacy left behind by Brazil and its political cronies."
POLITICS_CARLOS_LUZ_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Coimbra da Luz was born in 1894 in a small town in the state of Minas Gerais, but later moved to the capital of Belo Horizonte to study, but the man always considered the town of Leopoldina, where his residence is located and where had had multiple terms as mayor. Having only recently joined the national stage of politics, Luz became a federal representative only recently in the 1936 elections with the ED, but since then has managed to maintain a steady political career, but always distrusted the further left members of that alliance, whom he saw as spies for foreign countries at best. An accomplished man who has performed varied roles, such as teachers, police captain and bank manager, Luz both understands the economic realities of the nation's hinterlands and the poverty that it's small towns have to endure, and has always positioned himself in favour of a less centralized taxation system, which is an oddity in his own party."
POLITICS_JK_RJM_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the mother of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War, and began his by now very long political career. Now faced with the challenge of ruling a nation wracked by war and in dire administrative straits, JK, as he is known by the people, has to not only deal with the ever competitive oligarchic politicians, but also with the ever looming threat of debt, as most taxation infrastructure did not make it past the war. But he also has big plans for both Rio and Belo Horizonte, cities in dire need of extensive public works, but already many in his opposition call these planes a ''hurricane of spending'', and yet he remains undeterred. Opposition to said remodeling is going to be especially complicated in Rio, where many attempts to do so have been thwarted in the past decades by numerous mayors and presidents."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_RJM_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, and already as a young man he opposed the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the  interstate war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of the war has been long left behind. His stances on economic and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the complicated landscape left by the war may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."

However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Rio and Minas, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_ARAKEN_OLIVEIRA_HOS_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Araken de Oliveira has always had the interests of Brazil at heart throughout his distinguished military career. A war veteran and respected officer, his current position as head of state is in no doubt due to the fact that only the remnants of the brazilian army can maintain law and order throughout Vera Cruz. While the suspension, at least for now, of any kind of elections for executive power is indeed a harsh measure, harsh measures have to be taken if this young nation is to succeed in re-establishing the rule of law in both its cities and hinterlands, a task Araken has to undertake for the sake of his home."
POLITICS_BELISARIUS_PITY_DESC:0 "Belisário Augusto de Oliveira Penna was born in Barbacena, Minas Gerais, in 1868, and began his political career as a city councillor in Juiz de Fora, and only in the 1920s he projected himself outside of his home state, positioning himself in favour of right wing tenentist uprisings. For most of his life, he was a doctor and has a belief in scientific principles being applied to politics and governments. While a supporter of radical integralism, he often found himself marginalized even among that radical movement due to his beliefs regarding eugenics, a concept which he pioneered in Brazil, and he was for many years a member of the Central Eugenics Committee. These viewpoints have also granted him many allies and admirers that share similar beliefs, and now he and his associates are in a prime position to apply their ideas as practical principle, to ensure the great cities of the land like Rio are finally cleansed of its poverty and superstition that hide under the guise of 'local culture'. Belisário is also a supporter of utilizing political prisoners as a workforce, a controversial and divisive viewpoint even among the right winger clique that now form his cabinet."
POLITICS_BIG_MOURA_JR_DESC:0 "Olympio Mourão Filho was born in 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais. Having followed a fairly standard military career, his first active combat duty was during the interstate war, where he was among the defeated officers that sided with the federal government. He has since completely and utterly lost faith in the very concept of liberal democracy, and has written books on the subject of a new kind of state, an ''Integral Democracy''. His republican beliefs have kept him somewhat distanced from the AIB, even if they did enjoy his full support in their ideals of dismantling the carcass of the republic as it currently stood. To him, an organic democracy is the conclusion of his studies and ideology, which also changed as the war took a turn for the worse. Now in a position to truly rule and liberate the lands of Vera Cruz from the blight of marxism and liberalism, Mourão leads the newly formed integralist movement in conjunction with similarly minded officers, even if many of the more monarchic elements have been tossed to the wayside, and will do everything in his power to ensure that his political mantra, where the Army, Navy and Paramilitary Militias sustain a united and strong integralist state where faith in God and in the nation are the principles to be maintained, instead of idolatry of wealth and syndicalism."

Lagrosillière is a strong proponent of turning colonies into Departments, and the Federation of Martinique, without Lagrosillière, fell apart. It was revived in 1924 as the Second Federation. However, Lagrosillière continued his socialist advocacy in the Caribbean, continuing to become a politician in the West Indies Federation after the Weltkrieg.\n\nIn 1919, he made an electoral alliance with Fernand Clerc, a Béké industrialist on the island, which alienated him from his old socialist allies that criticized his 'alliance with capitalists'.

After working his way through high school, Aimé Césaire journeyed to the Commune of France in 1931, disgusted with the colonial system of the West Indies and seeking to pursue the kind of higher education he had been unable to attain on his home island. During his sojourn at the Sorbonne University, he joining with a cadre of other black students, eventually founding a newspaper dubbed "L'Étudiant Noir" which promoted anti imperialist ideals and railed against the exiled French Republic's treatment of their colonial subjects. Aimé also coined the term Négritude, a literary movement promoting a revitalisation of African and Caribbean culture, as well as condemned the irreparable damage caused by the "decadent, morally degenerated parasites" who had oppressed his people. Due to his increasing conflicts with fellow students and teachers in the Commune, which he attributed to racial tensions and prejudice, Aimé eventually chose to return back to the West Indies Federation, just in time to bear witness to the people of the Caribbean cast off their chains. Invigorated by the struggle for liberation, he directed his revolutionary zeal and anti colonial fury towards building up and impressive line of credentials, penning radical treatises and holding fiery speeches on what he desired and demanded the new socialist government must due for the victims of imperialism. It was no surprise that in time, Césaire took it upon himself to see this dreams made reality, in a few years managing to rise to the top of the new Federation's political sphere."

Following the destruction of Gansu, Sheng took a job offer from Fan Yaonan to lead the Aksu Garrison.

His family was poor and he received little schooling in his early years. In 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution, Burhan accompanied Tatar merchants to Dihua in Xinjiang and worked as an apprentice and store-clerk. In 1914, Burhan was able to apply and receive Chinese citizenship from the Republic of China on account of his family's ancestry. He spoke Uyghur, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Turkish and some Arabic and acted as the interpreter for Xinjiang Governor Yang Zengxin. Burhan's relations to the Turkic community soured as a result of working under Yang Zengxin, and fellow Ughiers began to ostracize Burhan. Burhan's meager position in Yang's administration meant he was unable to mend this distrust, and the Ughier community's drift towards rebellion alienated Burhan further. Ultimately Burhan choose to attend courses at Baoding Army School starting in 1929, allwoging him to be hired by Yang as both an administrator and officer. Upon Burhan's return to Xinjiang in 1934, he found the administration in decline, and unable to correct the widening gap between the Ughier community and has resigned himself to being an effective public servant under what he considers the best possible administration to industrialize Xinjiang.

This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of reactionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclamation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badly divided."

After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nSince then, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang has led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921. However, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. With the threat of the Zili Clique and their German Patrons looming in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces have largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and over ambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside."

After a brief stint in Jiangxi as the province's chairman and a lengthy career in the Kuomintang, Zhu Peide fled into exile after the KMT's failed Northern Expedition. Alongside most of the remaining 3rd NRA army, he returned back to his home region of Yunnan, beginning to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration.\nWhen Tang's government fell, Zhu Peide seized the oppertunity to rally the remnants of the Rightist Kuomintang and denounce Long Yun's takeover. Alongside his comrades, he marched west for Kunming and lead a successful takeover.

Whether that is the truth or not, it seems that whatever bond of blood or friendship existed between the two was not thick enough to prevent Lu Han from seizing this latest opportunity. The young Yi general has served with the Kuomintang, fought with the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang of Indochina, and now lead a daring coup against his former comrades. Lu has desperately gathered his forces in the capital and has set out to weather the coming storm. Yet the men around him wonder: can a man who betrayed his own supposed brother really be trusted?"

Under the patronage of Tang Jiyao, he climbed the ranks of the Yunnanese Army, eventually landing a comfortable position in the Kunming Military staff. With deep pockets and close connections to the officers and garrisons of the capital, Hu has made a risky gamble to oust and arrest his co-conspirators, proclaiming himself as Yunnan's new leader.

He joined a local militia and fought in the Xinghai revolution, climbing through the ranks until he was serving under Tang Jingyu as commander of the Fifth Army, within the Yunnan Clique. His rise to power was helped by the close comradeship he held with his superior, as well as his alleged half-brother Lu Han. Yet in time, these friendships would be tainted with political rivalry and a heated competition for power in the declining revolutionary movement. It has taken many sacrifices, many betrayals and certainly regrets, yet Long Yun has now risen to lead the Yunnan Clique as its new warlord.\nLong's hold over Yunnan is tenuous but determined, he holds plenty of ambitions to remain a leading figurehead for the coming years, yet just like how he ousted his predecessor there's a distinct risk his own subordinates could turn on him at any minute. This is not helped by Long's ethnic background as a member of the Yi minority, although it has helped foster friendships between his administration and his kinsfolk. A pragmatist, an outsider to the Han political elite, and an ambitious warlord: 'The Dragon of Yunnan' may be a force for China to reckon with."

At nine years of age, he was taken in by a wealthy uncle and later sent to study at Yunnan Military Academy. His time at the academy saw him enlist in the Tongmenhui, the predecessor to the Kuomintang. The next years in Zhu De's life were a turbulent series of travels throughout China, fighting at various revolutionary fronts with the National Republican Army, serving various political factions and building up a great network of connections. From Sichuan to Shanghai, Tibet and even a brief stint as a student in Berlin, the roads of fate eventually lead Zhu De back to Yunnan. In recent years he fell afoul of the warlord Tang Jiyao's despotism, being driven to resign his position in the National Republican Army and promise to abstain from politics rather than face an umpteenth journey around the Asian continent.\nZhu De had perhaps expected to spend the rest of his life as a teacher at the Yunnan Military Academy, yet the news that Tang's government had fallen, and that all hell was breaking loose in Yunnan convinced him resurface from obscurity. Outwitting and outlasting the failed would-be despots of Yunnan, Zhu has set out with a simple goal, to here in Yunnan build the moral and responsible democratic institutions which he has studied, taught and dreamed of."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LI_XIN_DESC:0 "Li Xin initially attended a German Private school in Kunming, where after he would study at various universities around the country. He first studied agronomy in Nanjing's South Eastern University, but was transferred to Beijing Agriculture University. During his stay in the Northern capital he became increasingly interested by foreign political thought, studying the failed Bolshevik movement in Russia and the now ascendant Syndicalist ideology in Europe. Throughout the 20s he grew increasingly closer to Syndicalism and later with other radical students at the university to form a political group named the "Renovation Society" in order to promote leftist views. After graduating in 1926, he traveled to Guangzhou and attended a lecture held by the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang on Agricultural Socialism. Although Li was at this point enamoured with Syndicalism, he accepted a request from the political representatives to join the Communist Party and help organise a political movement back in his home province of Yunnan. Dubbed the "Yunnan Special Branch", this group was initially meant to collaborate with its superiors but lost contact with the mother party following the failure of the Northern Expedition.\nLi, as one of the key figures in the group began to apply the same ideological currents which had dominated the Renovation Society, building an underground intellectual society of Syndicalist radicals in the heart of Kunming. This lead to a large schism between those loyal to the Special Branch's original beliefs, and Li's Syndicalist influence, eventually leading to Li's party founding 'Xindianshe' or 'The New Society' as a separate group. Despite his revolutionary convictions, Li has managed to remain below the radar of Tang's government. Initially several warlords in Yunnan were aware of his leftist beliefs, but had little reason to persecute a simple agricultural scholar. That all changed when Li Xin journeyed to various Yunnanese tin mines, hoping to organize the workers into a union. He even disguised himself as a miner, toiling away in hopes of growing closer to the proletariat. After organizing a wildcat strike in 1929 Li was almost arrested and executed, which forced him to go into hiding. Since then he has continued to grow his political influence, hoping to once more unite the Yunnanese workers and show the warlords what power truly lies in the hands of the proletariat."

Early on he began to associate with radical student groups, getting to know several influential figures such as Li Xin and Li Dazhou. While many of his comrades dabbled in studying the newly resurgent Syndicalist movement that was sweeping through Europe and America, Wang remained a committed Marxist. He later joined Li Xin's "Renovation Society", a leftist group which promoted socialist ideology at Beijing University. During this time he witnessed many of his comrades be repressed, arrested and even executed by the Beijing government, driving him down a vengeful and authoritarian path. Much like his colleague Li Xin, he met with members of the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang, being similarly instructed to travel back to Yunnan and organize socialists within the province. The hope was to topple the warlord Tang Jiyao's hold over the south west, by founding a 'Yunnan Special Branch' of the Communist Party that could ferment revolution.\nYet the Special Branch was nearly annihilated when the Northern Expedition failed, and its superiors among the CPC and Leftist Kuomintang ended up scattered to the wind. Worst of all for Wang, his own comrades now began to turn on him. Rejecting the old authorities they had followed and beginning to rally around Li Xin's own syndicalist views. Outraged, Wang seized control of the special branch and moved to expel Li. During his tenure as leader of the underground revolutionary society, he worked to regain contact with whatever remnants of the Kuomintang or CPC might still be organized and continuing the fight in China. After years of silence and falls leads, he finally found them. The ZhongTeJu, and through a series of secret meetings, encoded messages and risky plans, the Yunnan Special Branch was restored to its original purpose: To ferment revolution against the Yunnan warlords. Despite his new superiors and the schism with his old comrades, Wang remains diligently committed to one single goal, revolution before all."

During his stay in Kunming he began reading political literature, both the more mainstream democratic manifestos but also digging into forbidden communist propaganda that had been outlawed under the warlord Tang Jiyao's rule. After attempting to organize political activities among his fellow students, he was expelled from the school. Outraged at this censorship, Zhao decided to leave Yunnan and join the Kuomintang's armies to the east. During the coming military campaigns he served as an officer under Zhu Peide, distinguishing himself thanks to his analytical mind and aptitude for strategic thinking. It was also around this time he first joined the Communist Party of China, but his hopes of working with fellow socialists both within the party and the Kuomintang was short lived. The failure of the Northern Expedition broke the democratic and socialist movements in southern China, forcing Zhao to flee back to Yunnan alongside his superior Zhu Peide. During his exile, he distanced himself from both the other rightist Kuomintang exiles.
