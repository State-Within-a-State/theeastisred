gal.1.t:0 "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
gal.1.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
gal.1.a:0 "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
gal.1.b:0 "Galicia shall remain independent."

gal.2.t:0 "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
gal.2.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish territory."
gal.2.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

gal.3.t:0 "Claiming the Bucovina"
gal.3.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, its southernmost province, the Bucovina, is home to many Romanians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.3.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.3.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.4.t:0 "Claiming East Galicia"
gal.4.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, the East is home to mostly Ukrainians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.4.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.4.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.5.t:0 "Romania Has Marched into the Bucovina"
gal.5.d:0 "An incorporation of a territory as large as Galicia was never expected to go smoothly. However what wasn't expected was meddling from the outside - Romanian troops have marched into the largely Romanian-speaking territory Bucovina, claiming the state as their own. Officials of the former Galician government have urged us to intervene."
gal.5.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.5.b:0 "Let the Romanians have what speaks Romanian."

gal.6.t:0 "The Ukraine has Seized Eastern Galicia"
gal.6.d:0 "Kraków and Lwów are the most important cities of Galicia. The integration of the former has gone smoothly over the run of the last week, however the inhabitants of the mostly Ruthenian-speaking territories surrounding Lwow have, with aid of the Ukrainian military, seized the city. The city of Lwów is too important for Poland to just let it fall into the hands of another country."
gal.6.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.6.b:0 "Ruthenians aren't Poles anyway."

gal.7.t:0 "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"
gal.7.d:0 "The current Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria, Karl Albrecht von Habsburg, has just been elected as the new King of Poland after an intensely contested vote. Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Jozef Haller von Hallenburg in charge of Galicia in his absence."
gal.7.a:0 "Wish him luck."
