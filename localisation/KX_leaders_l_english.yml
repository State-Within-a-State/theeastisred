POLITICS_BOB_BARTLETT_DESC:0"Bob Bartlett was a University of Alaska graduate turned News Reporter until 1933, where he became the secretary of Alaskan politician Anthony Dimond. In 1934 and upwards, Bartlett served as a secretary and running-mate to Ernest Greuning. Together, both men focussed their political efforts on improving the state of Alaska’s people. Bartlett is characterized by his morals and constant servitude to Alaska, a land which he has no intention to let fall into the hands of anything but a strong, people-powered government"
POLITICS_BIRCH_DESC:0"Stephen Birch presided over Kennecott Copper, the Alaska based, largest copper production company in America. The Alaskan Syndicate member resigned as President of Kennecott in 1933, although he kept control of other mineral and transportation companies centered in Alaska. When Alaska declared independence from America, Birch and the rest of the Syndicate immediately jumped on ship with the Last Frontier, seeing their opportunity to control the frozen peaks and land. Reinstating himself as Kennecott Copper President, Birch remains on top of one of the richest and most powerful corporations in the world"
POLITICS_GUGGENHEIM_DESC:0"Simon Guggenheim of the Jewish descended Guggenheim Family is a rich Capitalist with with significant control over Alaska’s copper, salmon, and transportation industries. His Alaskan Syndicate, made to monopolize Alaskan resources and gain political power over its people, rivals Alaska’s own Legislation on terms of political pull. Upon Alaska’s break from America in 1937, Simon Guggenheim travelled to the frozen land to secure complete power over it in its unstable governmental state. Guggenheim’s plans are big, but so is the work needed to put them into action"
POLITICS_JAMES_WICKERSHAM_DESC:0"James Wickersham served as Alaskan District Judge in the years 1900 - 1908, where he ran for a spot as territorial representative to the US House of Reps, a position he held until 1933. Although technically a Republican, his personal war with the Alaskan Syndicate’s cruelly capitalistic business methods caused him to seek heavy Federal assistance for Alaska. Ultimately at the end of his terms, his pushes against the Syndicate were not assisted by the rest of the Legislation, and the situation had only gotten worse in time. Angered by the Legislations refusal to crack down on the Barons, Wickersham wants for Alaska a land where the people’s work cannot be tarnished by greedy businessmen and capitalists, but his left leaning supporters yearn for a more red set of ideals"
POLITICS_AUSTIN_DESC:0"“Alaska’s First Homegrown Millionaire” was a well known Industrialist from Seattle who, in 1895, transported goods to and from Alaska in the Klondike Gold Rush. The wealthy man owns a mining development company and numerous movie theaters, as well as a newspaper company. Opposing federal control of businesses, but fearful of Syndicate buying out, Lathrop heads the Alaska Corporate Party as a means of assisting his and other smaller scale business owners’ interests"
POLITICS_DIMOND_DESC:0"Anthony Dimond of New York came to Alaska in 1905 as a prospector. In his major Political years, he served as a US Commissioner, an Assistant Attorney, a Mayor, and a Senator, all based in Alaska. Dimond’s heavy portfolio shows him as a clear, intelligent man whose feats are only contested by his brutal anti-semetism. This trait has caused him to be at odds with the Jewish-descended Guggenheim’s, and Dimond holds a certain disdain for large and wealthy groups who attempt to lead average people"
POLITICS_SUTHERLAND_DESC:0"An Alaskan Representative to the US House of Reps from 1921 to 1931, “Fighting Dan’s” dog sled campaigning and aircraft rescuing career seemed to end after he moved to Pennsylvania. In 1937, the politician turned purchasing agent fled back to Alaska with the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, welcomed with open arms by fellow Republicans as the man who could fight to keep a conservative majority as the Last Frontier’s political climate went below zero"
POLITICS_ERNEST_GRUENING_DESC:0"Ernest Greuning, Harvard Graduate who served briefly in the Weltkrieg in field artillery, came to Alaska in 1934 as Director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions under Herbert Hoover. Alaska’s desperate economical situation alongside America’s growing political tensions caused Greuning to stay in the Last Frontier. Upon the outbreak of the 2ACW in 1937, Greuning took the title of Alaskan President in place of Governor John Weir Troy with the goal of helping Alaska not only survive, but thrive in their intense physical and political climate"
POLITICS_LOVESTONE_DESC:0 "Jay Lovestone was born as Jacob Liebstein in Belarus. His father moved to America, and became attached to Socialist ideas, eventually joining the fledgeling American Communist Party. As Communism became overshadowed by Syndicalism, Lovestone refused to adapt, keeping true to his Communist ideas even has Communism collapsed. This gained him many enemies within the new Socialist Party of America, who he refused to support. As America broke out into Civil War, Lovestone begrudgingly supported the Combined Syndicates, however, was exiled once it was found out that he was feeding information about the government to MacArthur. With nowhere else to flee; Lovestone took a ship to the last place that would take him in, Alaska.  Now in Alaska, Lovestone has rallied other exiled to his side, and helped for the new neo-socialist ideas that were made famous in Alaska. Now in charge of Alaska, Lovestone will set out to reform the Last Frontier with new socialistic ideals. "
POLITICS_TOWNER_DESC:0 "Born in the late 1890's on the Siletz Reservation in Oregon, Elwood Towner has lived quite the interesting life. Stolen away from his people by the White Man and forced to attend the Chemawa Indian School, Towner developed a hate for his oppressors early on. Later serving in the United States Marine Corp and seeing action in Mexico and other minor American theatres of war, Towner came home a changed man. He would attend law school, focusing his study on native advocacy and would only take indigenous clients, eventually suing the boarding school that stole him from his people and forcing its closure. With this, Towner tasted victory over the White Man and he liked its flavor. He would further radicalize, being inspired by other ethnically-focused thinkers in Japan and the American South, and began forming his own ideas on how the Red Man should live moving forward. Now, with the rapid destabilization of the United States and the looming threat of civil war, Towner has seen all he needs to see to understand who the White Man truly is: savages, dogs, mongrels, or worse.  With these facts clear, Towner has marched to Alaska to set his plan in motion. Under Towner, the Red Man's days under the White boot are numbered."
POLITICS_RAND_DESC:0 "Alisa Rosenbaum had taken an interest in politics and philosophy from young age. An avid supporter of Alexander Kerensky. Rosenbaum became a mildly successful political writer before fleeing her native Russia after the turmoil of 1936. Traveling east to the land of opportunity, Rosenbaum renewed her career with Anthem until the Civil War brought it to a screeching halt. Stuck in the Last Frontier, Rosenbaum saw an opportunity to bring her ideas from paper to reality. Having now secured Alaska, only time will tell how successful her Objectivist experiment will fare..."

POLITICS_BOB_MINOR_DESC:0 "Bob Minor, known as 'Fighting Bob' was an old socialist cartoonist. Though his family once rubbed shoulders with Texan high society, they had lost their silver spoon by the time of Minor’s birth. Living in San Antonio, he only received education from age 10-14 before seeking work to support his family. While working in a series of jobs, Bob began to develop his artistic skills in his spare time with what spare time he had, and eventually became a renowned political cartoonist. It was through these cartoons that he expressed his developing radical views, especially his fondness for revolutionary industrial unionism. His life would be forever changed in 1907, when Minor joined the Socialist Party of America. Given the weakness of the party in the state of Texas, Minor did not take part in the sort of major riots or strikes that occurred in the Red Belt. Instead, Minor went abroad, covering the Mexican Revolution and making a trip to Paris where he fraternized with revolutionary intellectuals, further radicalizing his views. Upon returning home, he was horrified by the persecutions of leftists by the Wilson and Palmer administrations, and from then on dedicated his life's work to preserving grassroots socialism in Texas, and appealing to the revolutionary states for aid to the SPA. When the Civil War erupted, Minor, instead of taking refuge in Chicago, elected to remain in his native home of Texas, regardless of the danger. His refusal to leave spread his fame around the state, and Minor was soon helping to found the Socialist Party of Texas, in determined to bring the revolution to the state. Now in power, only the future will tell if he can complete the transformation of Texas into a red paradise."
POLITICS_MARTIN_DIES_DESC:0 "While Martin Dies Jr. is a politician, those who look at him as just another bureaucrat in a suit would be mistaken. Originally just another Texan Democrat in the House of Representatives, Dies rose in prominence for his passionate opposition to syndicalism. By the time of the 1936 election, he was Chairman of the House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities and a key ally of John Nance Garner. Once Texas declared its intent to break away from the union, Dies returned to his home state, taking with him his authoritarian tendencies. Hungry for power in the young Texan nation, Dies turned away from Garner to Huey Long and the America First Party. After gaining the favor of New Orleans, Dies became the head of the Texan branch of the America First Party, and now serves as Governor following Texas’ decision to bow to the Union State. Dies is quickly emerging as an important figure within the right wing of the America First Party and is even reputed to privately support the Christian Party. Meanwhile, he suppresses opposition to his authority, and is carefully working to shape Texas in his image as much as Long will allow."
POLITICS_EAKER_DESC:0 "Ira Clarence Eaker was born in Field Creek, Texas on April 13th, 1896. When he was old enough, he commanded the 5th Aero Squadron and later was post adjutant. Captain Ira Eaker continued his career from his Boeing P-12, but in June 1924, Eaker was named executive assistant in the Office of Air Service at Washington, D.C. From December 21st, 1926, to May 2nd, 1927, he served as a pilot of one of the Loening OA-1 float planes of the Pan American Goodwill Flight that made a 22,000 mile trip around South America and, with the others, was awarded the Mackay Trophy. He then became the executive officer in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War at Washington, D.C. Even better for Eaker, he was also named operations and line maintenance officer at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C. While on that duty, he participated as chief pilot on the endurance flight of the Army plane, Question Mark, from January 1st to 7th, 1929, establishing a new world flight endurance record. For this achievement, the entire crew of five, including Eaker and mission commander Major Carl Spaatz, were awarded the DFC. In 1930, he made the first transcontinental flight entirely with instruments. In October 1934, Eaker was ordered to duty at March Field, California, where he commanded the 34th Pursuit Squadron and later the 17th Pursuit Squadron. In the summer of 1935, he was detached for duty with the Navy and participated aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, on maneuvers in Hawaii and Guam. When Texas left the Union, he returned to his Home State, and was promoted to General. Now, after his illustrious career, he rules Texas as a military dictator, keeping order in the state and ensuring that it doesn't fall to the hands of traitors. Though he may be unexperienced in the realm of politics, he is confident he has just the strength he needs to keep control of Texas."
POLITICS_NIMITZ_DESC:0 "Admiral Nimitz has become Texas' new Commander-in-chief. He is a navy man, a man who commanded a fleet in Pearl Harbor, where he gained significant experience in his craft and was able to impress his superiors. Despite his extensive travel, he is a native Texan, and recently, he has fled to his home state following the collapse of the Federal Government. He has served Texas as best he could since that time and protected the Gulf of Mexico from enemy incursion. Now that he is in charge, he plans to keep the state safe from invasions from the land or sea, and to do this, he hopes to build up the military so it will be a match for any who dare to attack Texas. First and foremost though, he is a supporter of the Navy, and will make sure it is funded and bolstered enough that it will make Texas a force to be reckoned with on the waves."
POLITICS_CACTUS_JACK_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas. Now, he is the new President of Texas. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, fiercely loyal to his home state: Texas. He abandoned the U.S. when he saw them sell out his beloved homestate, and fled to be with his family and his home. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right, though some of his policies teeter on authoritarianism."

POLITICS_FRANK_HAMER_DESC:0 "A marksman, a Texas Ranger, and the man who hunted down Bonnie and Clyde. Captain Frank Hammer is a lot of things; tough, investigative, and fiercely loyal. And now, thanks in part to his law enforcement carer, he has been elected Texas' President. As the leader of the new state, Hamer hopes to bring the same order he brought to the streets to Texas as a whole."
POLITICS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The National Committee of State. A boring name given to such an...interesting group. Regardless, it is also known as the "Shotgun Regency", a committee of the most influential men in Texas. This is not a council designed to benefit the people; it is designed to benefit Texaco. The council is not here to stay, it is not something permanent. Rather, it is just something to provide the facade of a democratic presence while the corporations take over the country. In reality, the Oil Barons couldn't care less about Democracy, and while their plans are unknown, what is certain is that the profits of Texaco and others will never be higher."
POLITICS_TORKLID_RIEBER_DESC:0 "Nobody expected Rieber to end up in the place he is today. He was born in Norway, thousands of miles away from our shores. However, having made a living as a sailor, Rieber found himself in Texas. He eventually found himself managing a Texaco cargo ship, and in time rose to lead that company. Having gained Texaco's highest position, he began his crusade against socialism. An outspoken admirer of radical right-wing leaders such as Codreanu, Reiber was a prominent donor to William H. Murray's presidential bid, and is alleged to have funded Klan activities in the South. While America fell into civil war, Reiber moved swiftly to gain control over the young Texan nation, while doing what he could to aid the cause of the Constitutional American Republic. Now that he is firmly in control of Texas, he will seek to realise his dream of a state that answers to corporations."
POLITICS_WOODIE_GURTHIE_DESC:0 "Dubbed the "Oklahoma Cowboy", Woodie Guthrie became famous as a folk singer, and a crusader against the injustice of the old America, writing many socialist songs, such as "This Land is your land". And when Texas turned red, Guthrie rose to lead it. Infusing a sense of pride in Texas with his music, and bolstering the culture of Texas, Woody Guthrie's populist ideals of "cowboy socialism" have struck a chord with many Texan workers, and Guthrie will do what he can do make their dreams of a fair society come true." 
POLITICS_LBJ_DESC:0 "In 1937, Lyndon Baines Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas's 10th congressional district, that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country. Running as a populist Democrat, and co-operating with Huey Long and Richard Russell, he served in the House until Texas seceded from the Union. In the young Texan state, former supporters of Long or progressive Democrats came to rally around Johnson, with his charisma and charm making him a crucial advocate for social democracy in the young state. Now that he is at the helm of the Texan nation, Johnson will do his best to build a populist ang egalitarian society, and is not above making deals with the devil to achieve this."
POLITICS_JAMES_ALLRED_DESC:0 "James V Allred has had a long and fascinating career in Texas. Initially aligned with the Democratic Party's establishment, the breaking up of the Democrats into divergent factions, and the rise of Huey long, drove him further to the left, and Allred carved out a status as a progressive Democrat, a rare sight in a South dominated by the ODP. When Texas was plunged into chaos, Allred grew weary of America's failings and inadequecies, causing him to grow increasingly sympathetic to the nascent movement for Texan independence, to which he eventually hitched his wagon. He eventually gained the traction to hold a referendum, one that overwhelmingly passed. With Washington having failed in its duty to protect the Texan people, Allred finally abandoned the Democratic Party, and led Texas's secession at the head of the new Texan Independence Party. However, many are discontented with Allred's rule, and his days at the top may be numbered."
POLITICS_WL_ODANIEL_DESC:0 "Wilbert Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel, a songwriter-turned-President, has had an astonishing life behind him. A succesful musician in the 1920s, O'Daniel wrote many popular songs such as Beautiful Texas, and became a respected cultural figure within a divided America, seen by many as a wholesome symbol of traditional Texan values. As America further declined through the '30s, O'Daniel forged a political career, aligning himself with conservative Texan Democrats uneasy with both the rise of the ODP and Allred's progressivism. When Texas finally broke with the Union, O'Daniel's charismatic populism and promises of a small but fair state rapidly gained support among common Texans, who chose him as the young nation;s first elected President."

POLITICS_AHMAD_SHAH_QAJAR_DESC:0 "Installed as Shah of Iran at the age of eleven, it could be argued that Ahmad Shah was always at the whim of the Majilis, only a figurehead in a nation still struggling with the aftermath of the events of the 1920's and beforehand. Though he would attempt to repair and unite the nation, his efforts would almost always collapse. Though the most turbulent part of his reign is arguably at an end, that does not mean there are not those wishing to see the Shah removed - whether it be Democrats who wish to establish a republic, Royalists who want install a new monarch that can surpass Ahmad Shah's abilities, or even Socialists who want to bring about a socialist revolution akin to the one declared in 1920. It seems, with all these enemies against the Shah, and his health in steady decline, that it is only a matter of time before chaos erupts across the nation."
POLITICS_HASSAN_MIRZA_QAJAR_DESC:0 "As the Crown-Prince of Iran, Hassan Mirza lived in his older brother’s shadow ever since he was installed as Shah, and had little influence in the politics of Iran during the early years of Ahmad Shah’s rule. From a young age, he would be exposed to the countless conflicts and civil uprisings that plagued the nation, from the Jangali Uprising to foreign intervention from the British and Russia, all the while his brother would seemingly do little to stop it all.  Over many years however, he would slowly build up the political, military, and diplomatic connections he desired, and attained the respect that was fit for the brother and heir of the Shah. Now, with his ascension to the Sun Throne, he has reached the very top of the Iranian political world, and it is certain he will not squander the opportunity to bring Iran into the modern age as a force to be reckoned with."
POLITICS_SAYYED_HASAN_TAQIZADEH_DESC:0 "Taqizadeh, despite being known as one of the biggest and most influential advocates for modernisation and constitutionalism, came from a family of clergymen who were descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, and it had seemed that he would follow in the footsteps of his family. However, his interest and experience with Western democracy and modern enlightenment caused him to follow a new career into politics, where he soon became a strong advocate against the Qajars and for sweeping reforms to the nation in order for it to flourish in the 20th century. With the revolution that has swept the nation, and the deposition of the Qajars, Taqizadeh has formed a new government that will seek to recreate Iran as a nation of true democracy and prosperity."
POLITICS_IRAJ_ESKANDARI_DESC:0 "As a Qajar Prince, Eskandari was given an education in France where he was exposed to the young syndicalist nation and its socialist teachings, to which he had soon begun to admire. He would link up with other Iranian socialists in the country, and even some of the key figures of the Edalat Party who had been forced to flee after Ahmad Shah's attempted assassination, and the subsequent crackdown of socialism. Though he was unable to return home, he would slowly become one of the more popular figures of socialism in Iran, especially as the movement would begin to see greater popularity amongst the workers and peasants of Iran. With the Edalat Party now in power, Eskandari has been appointed as President of the new Socialist Republic, promising greater freedoms for peasants and unions, and the redistribution of wealth to the common people."
POLITICS_JAMES_BURNHAM_DESC:0 "A fellow-travelor of the far-left ever since he's been politically active, James Burnham began as a starry-eyed supporter of the Russian Revolution before seeing it quashed. His hope in socialism was revitalized with the British and French Revolutions only to witness the Empires of old not only persist but reform themselves internally. Influenced by French Sorelianism and his personal readings of Machiavelli he has come to view politics as largely a power struggle between competing elites with revolutions only temporarily succeeding in nations that failed to modernize their elite into a "Managerialist" class of technocratic minds as opposed to the aristocrats and capitalists of old. Viewing imperialist expansion as an inevitable consequence of their growing bureaucracies and promotion of national myths Burnham is dismayed by what he views as the infighting and factionalism promoted by traditional syndicalism and views socialism's only hope as being the promotion of a highly technocratic-oriented leadership alongside an American Nationalism that shall glue the nation together where socialism can not. His American Worker's Party (AWP) is currently a combination of his followers who de facto left the SPA's Federalist faction with him, Lovestoneites, national-syndicalists and Howard Scott's Technocratic Movement. While the latter has questionable loyalties to socialism he has promised to place them in charge of the economy in return for allowing him to run the political sphere in the power-oriented method he views as necessary."
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last 20 years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a sovereign nation and the leader of the Italian Federation, at least in an interim fashion. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towards His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."
POLITICS_JULIUS_EVOLA_DESC:0 "Baron Julius Evola is one of the most controversial political philosophers in Europe and, perhaps, the world. Devoting himself to an ideology that has been named "Radical Traditionalism", "Legionarism" and "Ultra-Rightism", Evola believes that modern society is in the age that Hinduism refers to as "Kali Yuga", or an age of darkess and choas. Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."

POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_III_DESC:0 "The Former King of Italy and Head of the main branch of the House of Savoy has returned from his long exile to find an army of fanatical monarchists at his disposal. He is utterly an admirer of Julius Evola, now his High Chancellor, for making the seemingly impossible come true and bringing to life his aspirations. It helps that the King is also known to harbor reactionary beliefs which grow increasingly right-wing with Evola at his side and the Socialist enemy in the north. He hopes that he and Legion can accomplish the seemingly impossible and defeat the traditional enemies to his power, the republicans, the socialists and the Catholic Church."
POLITICS_CAPONE_DESC:0"Alphonse Gabriel Capone, known more commonly as “Al Capone”, was born in New York City to Italian immigrants. His upbringing was tough, the streets of Brooklyn shaped his world views whilst his Catholic upbringing taught him that morals matter little in the modern world. Capone understood from a young age that in order to survive you have to be ruthless, the cutthroat world of business carved Capone into a prominent businessman profiteering off prohibition. Bootlegging proved successful and Capone expanded his growing empire into Chicago from where he took over failing businesses wrecked by economic stagnation. He also never forgot his roots and used his newfound wealth to set up soup kitchens for the homeless and provide honest work for the jobless. Despite accusations of involving himself with gangs and all sorts of illegal matters he developed a reputation amongst the working class as a “man of the people”. Capone became a prominent supporter of labour unions, especially the IWW, when the Second Civil War broke out Capone launched himself into politics. Aligning himself to the Centralist Faction, advocating for union control over all aspects of life he has clashed with anarcho-syndicalists who accuse him of being a potential dictator. Furthermore his gang affiliations have once again struck his credibility, accusations have emerged of Capone using the Chicago Mafia to intimidate political opponents. Now in control of the CSA, this bootlegging businessman turned defender of proletariat must decide the future of America and socialism."
POLITICS_AOG_BOARD_DESC:0"The Board of Directors is a council of the largest businesses in the AOG. They meet monthly to discuss the policy of the nation and decide on the future of the Concessions. While legally the board of directors is representative of all companies within the AOG, Krupp has the lines-share of influence, and many believe that the Board of Directors to be a complete front for Alfred Felix Alwyn von Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach’s and his company. And despite its vast influence, the Board of Directors is shrouded in deep secrecy, something representative of its elitist nature; but despite it’s secrecy, the power held by the Board of Directors is immeasurable. Even if the Board acting as head of state is a cover for Krupp’s ambitions."
POLITICS_JAMES_CURLEY_DESC:0 "A disaster mitigated by moments of farce or a Northern Huey Long, depending on who you ask. James Michael Curley, Governor of Massachusetts is corrupt as the day is long. Curley served four terms as the Mayor of Boston (one of them while in prison) and was under constant investigation by the Boston Finance Commission. It didn't keep him from being elected governor in 1935. Probably because while he was lining his own pockets, he was also building schools, libraries, parks, roads, and enlarging Boston City Hospital. An Irishman, a Democrat, and a popular Governor, Curley wields significant influence in New England."
POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "After the murder of his father by a dominionist assassin, Amanullah has been filled with a deep-seated hatred for the British. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the British Raj. For too long has the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. He also worked to put in place progressive reforms in his country. He instituted various legal reforms and repealed many of the harshest criminal penalties. Though at first strictly maintaining the country's neutrality in World War I, he would eventually cave after strenuous efforts by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a German military mission (the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition) to enlist Afghanistan on its side.

During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. Later, he returned to Kabul and joined Amanullah Khan's army. Kalakani would be a highwayman who mostly stole from the wealthy for some time. Only a few months after the disastrous 5th Anglo-Afghan War, Kalakani and his friends began to attack the unprotected Kabul from the north.

Wild tribesmen from Waziristan had the southern areas of Kabul surrounded, and Kalakāni's forces moved into the heart of Kabul from the north, taking the capital. He finally had become King."
POLITICS_LOVECRAFT_DESC:0 "H.P. Lovecraft, born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and controversial figures of the 20th century. His father dying when he was 8, his mother dying of the Spanish Flu in late 1918, and Lovecraft suffering from a plethora of health issues his entire life have led Lovecraft into a search for truth and deep meaning, which he channeled into his writings. Tales of darkness and horror within resonated strongly with an America reeling from the 1925 market crash. Lovecraft's science fiction gained him a serious audience for his thoughts on politics and philosophy. He rapidly gained an almost cult-like status in his home state of Rhode Island and drew many followers, preaching a dark and otherworldly message about supernatural powers and eldritch beings that are incomprehensible to the human mind. As president of the New England Literary Society, Lovecraft standardized the use of the English language in print, removing what he called 'Americanisms'. When he traveled to England in 1924 to study the English language and attempt to purify it as much as possible, he witnessed the 1925 uprising and grew an acute hatred of Syndicalism. He returned to America in 1930, founded his own newspaper and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rhode Island. He remained a prominent thought leader and a powerful influence on the minds of New Englanders, although his opponents accuse Lovecraft of being a dangerous man with authoritarian and occultist inclinations."

A born Quaker, and a charitable worker known for his support of the lower-classes, Pickett had been invited to the White House during the Hoover presidency to advise on dealing with the misfortunes of America's coal-mining communities. However, his influential steps did not end there; Pickett became known as an advocate for Christian pacifism, as he counseled his fellow faithful on their purpose in life during the First Weltkrieg. While his drive for an end to all war through peaceful resolve may be seen as wishful zealotry, it is certain Pickett is the saint the Quakers need to lead them, in these dark times."

Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny.

A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian anti-capitalist state. His work was published by Valois who had taken interest in Déat and the two became fast allies, when the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Sorelans.\n\nRepresenting the ‘Vanguardist’ faction of the Sorelians, Déat has proved himself to be an opportunist first, and ideologue second. Forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against fellow comrades, Déat has fought his way to the top of the Sorelian leadership.

Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective.

He would go on to join the French Section of the Workers’ International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the CGT. But now with his rule secured by his astounding victory in the 1936 elections, the “political failure” is determined to live up to his predecessors and crush all who stand in his way of creating a true Communist French utopia."

It seems as if his life may just be a lesson on the instability of the universe; of the chaos of politics and human existence. Born to a noble Iranian-Azerbaijani family, Kazembek saw the brunt of the Russian Revolution; something that undoubtably shaped his eccentric political views. However, instead of turning him against the Soviets, the Revolution endeared in him a certain level of respect for the Soviet System. And even though the Red Revolution failed; Kazembek still incorporated parts of the Soviet Ideals into his personal politics. \n\n His Charisma and experience as an Orator put him at the forefront of the new “Young Russia” group, a group that rejected Reactionary Tsarism in favour of a “New and Dynamic Vision”. As the situation in Russia deteriorated, Professor Nikolai Ustryalov convinced Party Secretary Kazembek to side with Alexander Kolchak and his coup against the Petrograd Government. Kolchak’s coup however failed; resulting in the creation of the state of Transamur; the rump state where Kazembek and Ustryalov fled to. These series of events led to Ustryalov and Kazembek rejecting the ideology of the Whites in favour of the Bolsheviks. This idealization lead to the development of the concept of a “Labour Monarchy”, and a system that combines Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". And as his Ideology grew and Changed, so did the influence of the Mladorossi within Transamur. Their influence grew and expanded, to a point where they could seize power following the Anti- Kolchak Coup. \n\n Now, Kazembek stands as the “Vozd” of the Rump State of Transamur.

Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays lip service to the Mladorossi, it truly doesn't matter to him who holds the keys to power; as long as he is in charge in some form.

Despite his beginnings, he was able to earn a degree in classics, and his interest in politics only grew from there. In 1905, during the Russian Revolution, he was one of the principal founders of the powerful Black Hundredist movement. At the time, the movement suffered from crippling infighting, and Puriskevich himself had several rivals in the organization. Puriskevich had a role in the 1916 killing of Grigori Rasputin, believing his influence on the Tsarina and the country as a whole to be too dangerous to ignore. He developed many of his strongly anti-semitic, nationalist, and monarchist views during the Russian Civil War, in which he came to believe in an open fight against Jewry. \n\nWhen the Civil War ended, Puriskevich was not idle. His restlessness and charisma were powerful tools that he used to great success in propelling the RNSMA to national status, but they remained a fringe organization due to the existence of the republic. Now that they are in power, this situation has changed. Though he is old, Puriskevich will not squander the opportunity he has been waiting for for decades. His plans to restore the Russian Empire to greatness as one nation under one tsar will not be stopped by any means, and he will see to it that Russia is no longer the laughing stock of the world."

What started out as a gathering of 'Nortonites' led to him being swept up into the political upheaval and chaos plaguing the Pacific States at that time. Before he knew what was going on, he was being crowned Emperor Norton II in San Francisco, and after that; oddly enough came peace. Though he has attracted several loyal members and people who are willing to fight to the death for him, Norton is getting older with time.

The democratic process is worthless, all it has done is send America on a downward spiral. Because of this, Disney has done away with the democratic forces that are hindering his Visionary plans. The so-called 'Visionary Party' has stacked the government with people loyal to Disney and his plans for America and instituted a dictatorship with Disney at its head.

He did private practise across the US and Japan until 1936, where upon outbreak of Civil War, Aiso supported the Government of his native Pacific States; and fled to Sacremento to aid the government. That should have been the height of his life, however through the chaos that engulfed the Pacific States; Aiso manages to secure a spot on the California Supreme Court. And eventually, Aiso found himself the de-facto head of the Government after a constitutional crisis that resulted in the Provisional Supreme Court taking over. With Aiso now in charge, the future is uncertain; however one thing is for sure, America is forever changed."
POLITICS_PAL_PRONAY_DESC:0 "Pál Prónay de Tótpróna et Blatnicza was born on November 2, 1874 in Romhány in the north of the Kingdom of Hungary. He attended the Lahne Military Institute, but advanced slowly in his officer's career, in part because he was abusive and violent toward his own men. He served in the Austro-Hungarian army as a cavalry captain during the Weltkrieg, but remained a mid-level officer. After the Weltkrieg, Prónay joined with many Hungarian Weltkrieg veterans in supporting far-right, nationalist politics. He was most influenced by the views of Gyula Gömbös, though he disagreed with his anti-Habsburg sentiments. That is, until the Emperor unveiled his plans for the national dismemberment of the Kingdom of Hungary, into a collection of minority states. Prónay now carries on the legacy of Gömbös and intends to implement his socio-economic system of 'National Socialism' throughout Hungary."
POLITICS_ANTON_LEHAR_DESC:0 "Lehár was born in Sopron, Austria-Hungary, as the younger son of a bandmaster in the Infantry Regiment No. 50 of the Austro-Hungarian Army. His elder brother, Franz Lehár, went on to become a celebrated composer, but Anton chose the military life. He entered cadet school in Vienna to become a professional officer, finishing at the top of his class in 1893. Prior to the outbreak of war, Lehár joined the general staff and served as a musketry instructor, where his skill was honored even by foreign governments in Romania and Turkey. Lehár's leadership and valor during the Weltkrieg saw him severely wounded and rewarded with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, ennobling him with the title 'Freiherr von.' Despite his wounds and value as a training officer, he repeatedly requested assignments to the front to command men in battle. After the Weltkrieg, Lehár continued to serve His Apostolic Majesty in the Royal Hungarian Honvéd."
POLITICS_HUN_MOVE_DESC:0 "MOVE (Hungarian National Defense League) grew out of the 'right radicals' phenomenon - those who strongly opposed the Hungarian Soviet Republic but who felt that the mainstream conservatives were not strong enough to cope with the shift to communism. Made up of royalists, reactionaries, and 'national socialists' influenced by the late Gyula Gömbös, MOVE is a loosely organized paramilitary organization made up of the veterans and rebellious army divisions who deposed the Kunist regime in Budapest."
POLITICS_BELA_KUN_DESC:0 "Béla Kohn, later known as Béla Kun, was born on 20 February 1886 in the village of Lele, located near Szilágycseh, Transylvania. Before the Weltkrieg, he was a muck-raking journalist with sympathies for the Hungarian Social Democratic Party in Kolozsvár. In addition, Kun served on the Kolozsvár Social Insurance Board (and was later accused of embezzling board funds). He had a fiery reputation and was involved in several duels. Kun fought in the Weltkrieg for Austria-Hungary, but was captured by the Russians. It was during this time that he became interested in communism. Ultimately, he became a supporter of the failed Bolshevik revolution, and became a permanent exile after the victorious Germans put a stop to Bolshevism. However, this did not stop Kun from founding the Hungarian Communist Party with his fellow Hungarian exiles, Mátyás Rákosi and Tibor Szamuely. When the Commune was born in Paris, Kun found asylum in France, where he continued to plot Hungary's revolution."
POLITICS_MATYAS_RAKOSI_DESC:0 "Rákosi was born in 1892 in Ada, a village in Bács-Bodrog County. In 1910, as a student, he joined the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) and was also a secretary and active member of the anarcho-syndicalist student movement, the Galilei Circle. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War and was captured on the Eastern Front in 1915 and held as a prisoner-of-war in Far Eastern POW camps by the Russians until the end of the war. During the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, he escaped bondage and joined the revolutionaries in Petrograd. Once Russia's revolution failed, he joined Kun's clique of Hungarian socialist revolutionaries. Unlike Kun, prone to violent temper and disliked by many party operatives, Rákosi seems able to 'work the system.' This is not to say he is any less violent or brutal than Kun, only that he knows when to pick his battles, and dispatches not merely his enemies, but his enemies' families as well."
POLITICS_ARPAD_SZAKASITS_DESC:0 "Leader of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, Szakasits has always been considered dangerous by Hungarian conservatives and royalists because of his friendly attitude towards Syndicalists. Whether this is born of naivety or more sinister feelings is anyone's guess. Whatever the case, Szakasits is sure to make many changes to Hungary's stratified, religious society, as well as make appeals to the country's various minorities... a move sure to make him even less popular with the nation's Magyar majority."
POLITICS_MIHALY_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "The Károlyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, Roman Catholic aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century. Mihály was born in Fót, Austria-Hungary. In his youth, he was a wastrel, but as he grew older, he became devoted to more serious pursuits. In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, Károlyi gradually became more progressive and left-wing during his career. During the Weltkrieg, the pro-Entente Károlyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. For most, such a position would have meant political suicide after the war, but Károlyi has parleyed anti-Habsburg sentiment within Hungary, stoked by the Second Ausgleich of 1927, to take the reins of the pro-independence movement as leader of the Party of Independence."
POLITICS_ISTVAN_BETHLEN_DESC:0 "he scion of a noble Transylvanian family, Bethlen was elected to the Hungarian parliament as a Liberal in 1901. Bethlen steadily moved to the right during and after the Weltkrieg, in response to the excesses of the Socialist and Syndicalist revolutions of Russia and France, as well as the burgeoning social democratic party within Hungary. In 1936, he became one of the nation's most prominent politicians when he took control of the National Constitution Party, a conservative Hungarian political party opposed to the Second Ausgleich and continued Austrian interference, but not committed to the same radical social reforms promised by his rivals like Károlyi and Szakasits."
POLITICS_GYULA_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "He was born in Nyírbakta (now: Baktalórántháza) to an old aristocratic family. His parents were Count Tibor Károlyi, who served as Speaker of the House of Magnates from 1898 to 1900, and Countess Emma Degenfeld-Schomburg. Tibor Károlyi was also the guardian of Gyula's first cousin, Mihály Károlyi. Unlike his cousin, Gyula is a conservative politician, against radical social change and in favor of balanced budgets."
POLITICS_PAL_TELEKI_DESC:0 "Teleki was born to Géza Teleki (1844–1913), a Hungarian politician and Minister of the Interior, and his wife Irén Muráty (Muratisz) (1852–1941), the daughter of a wealthy Greek merchant, in Budapest, Hungary. Teleki attended the Royal Hungarian Academy of Economics and graduated with a PhD in 1903. He went on to become a university professor and expert on geography and socio-economic affairs in Hungary and a well-respected educator. He interrupted his career to volunteer for the Weltkrieg. After the war, Teleki Teleki was instrumental in supporting Scouting within Hungary. He became Hungary's Chief Scout, a member of the International Scout Committee, and Camp Chief of the 4th World Scout Jamboree held at The Royal Forest at Gödöllő. At the same time, Teleki entered into politics in earnest as a member of the Smallholder's Party. While not explicitly opposed to the Habsburg monarchy, Teleki believes above all in preserving Hungary's autonomy and national borders, as well as snuffing out any syndicalist revolutionary movements in the nation."

After the Kunist revolution, Teleki joined the counterrevolutionary government and became much more sympathetic to 'National Socialism' as well as explicitly anti-Habsburg. Now as Prime Minister of the nation, Teleki is focused on preserving Hungarian autonomy within the Great Game of Europe."
POLITICS_MIKLOS_KALLAY_DESC:0 "The Kállay family was old and influential among the local gentry of their region and Miklós served as lord lieutenant of his county from 1921-29. He then moved on to national government, serving first as deputy under secretary of state for the Ministry of Trade. He held high positions within the Emperor's government, prior to the nation's independence, but was not explicitly pro-Habsburg himself. While a conservative, he is fiercely opposed to the philosophy of 'National Socialism' promoted by Hungary's far-right, which he deems a form of soft syndicalism."
POLITICS_ISTVAN_FRIEDRICH_DESC:0 "A Hungarian footballer, factory owner, and politician of a family of German origin, Friedrich was born in Malacka in northern Hungary. Friedrich studied engineering at the University of Budapest and worked for AEG in Berlin until 1908, when he returned to Hungary. He joined Mihály Károlyi's Independence Party, and the two became close friends. Yet, Friedrich's idealism did not survive the Weltkrieg, and he eventually drifted away from the socially radical aspects of Károlyi's platform, while still supporting independence. Following independence, Friedrich chafed at Károlyi's reforms, and decided to challenge him for the premiership, lest Károlyi continue to lead Hungary down the wrong path."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_AUGUST_DESC:0 "Archduke Joseph August Viktor Klemens Maria of Austria was born at Alcsút in the Kingdom of Hungary on the 9th of August, 1872. He was highly decorated during the Weltkrieg, involved on both the Galician and Italian fronts. As Palatine of Hungary, he is a compromise between the royalists and the nationalists of the counterrevolutionary movement. Not the Emperor himself, but still a Habsburg and representative of the monarchy."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany... now Carlos VIII of Spain. For the first time in over two centuries, a Habsburg is once again King of Spain. Carlos VIII was born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma. His mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Carlos VIII grew up in the Palais Toskana in Vienna, but moved to Barcelona at a young age. The youngest and furthest right of the Carlist claimants, Carlos VIII demonstrated his right-wing bona fides by joining a nationalist militia in Austria, participating in street fights against syndicalists from Vienna to Madrid. Now leader of the Carlists, Carlos VIII will restore Christ, Honor, and Tradition to Spain."
SCT_MACCORKMICK_DESC:0"A Lawyer, a Nationalist, and now the leader of a rebellion in Scotland. These are all positions held by John MacCormick, the man who hopes to free the Scottish Nation from English Tyranny. From an early age MacCormick was a fervent supporter of Scottish Home Rule, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. However, despite his oratory talents and large support base; Scottish Nationalism was suppressed by the more radical factions within the now Union of Britain; something exacerbated by his acceptance of more right-wing groups into his organization. Within time his organization was forced to go underground. This was the foundation of the modern Homeland Watch; an organization that was nothing but a fringe terror group at the time. But, as the Union of Britain disintegrated under Mosley’s totalitarian rule, the Homeland Watch took control over Scotland where the Brits had failed. And with the government crippled, MacCormick saw his chance to finally break the shackles that England has imposed on Scotland. The time was now, Scotland was to be free and there was no longer anyone to stop it."
POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The life of Saunders Lewis would start relatively unremarkable. He served in France during the First World War, and after that would serve as a teacher who would conduct lectures in Welsh. Lewis had saw what had been achieved in Ireland, and with that was inspired along with many others to strive for the complete independence of Wales. And as the British Revolution came, the time to act against the Anglo oppressors was now. Lewis founded the "National Party of Wales", which’s had goals to make a fully Welsh-Speaking Wales; however, through the years found itself drawn into the storm of military conflict with the newly formed Union of Britain. This drew Lewis’ party underground and formed out of it the Welsh Home Rule Army, a terrorist organization dedicated to Welsh Independence. Normally it would have stayed as a mere terrorist group, but the collapse of the Union of Britain and the subsequent succession of Scotland lead to Wales too abandoning the Union of Britain. And with the UOB’s collapse, the WHRA rose up against the tyrannical forces of Mosley to help establish an independent Wales. However, they made peace with Y’ Glais’ socialist government to do so. But once the war ended, Lewis deposed Y’ Glais, and to pander to the international stage established a “Regency Council”. This however did not lead to a King being crowned, and after it’s disillusion Lewis became the unchallenged master of Wales. Its destiny is still unclear, but regardless one thing will persevere under Lewis’ Rule: Wales’ freedom"

POLITICS_HERB_DESC:0 "A former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now the current President of the United States in exile, Herbert Hoover had solidified his position as one of the most hated men in American history. Despite only making the Great Depression worse during his first term, Hoover was reelected through the House of Representatives in 1932, causing widespread outrage. It's a sad reality for the President - any and all of his attempts for restoring the economy fail, his tries to calm the situation down only make it worse, and even his own party was turning away from him...\n\n That is all in the past now, however. America has fallen- no, America has been exiled, to Liberia. Destiny is a funny thing. Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. Hoover will restore the rightful America with his Legion of exiles. The American people will remember him as the greatest president in the country’s history."


POLITICS_FULTON_SHEEN_DESC:0 "Fulton John Sheen, Born in May 1895. Fulton made a name for himself with his teachings and being a well spoken preacher on the radio to catholic America. Although not as well known as Coughlin, this humble bishop had served as a servant to Catholics all across America with his teachings at the Catholic university and representation of them. This service and representation put him into the sight of Caroll who assigned him to his cabinet and had him continue to be the loyal preacher to the rapidly changing America. Now with the passing of Christ's regent Fulton Sheen has once again proven himself worthy in the eyes of the Holy American League who put their faith in him as Caroll’s successor. Sheen now has a lot of decisions on his plate, however keeping the spirit of Caroll’s America is his main goal, for blessed are the pure of heart."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_SMITH_DESC:0 "Many politicians profess a desire for reform or pretend to crusade against corruption in all forms, but only a select few politicians both hold true to these promises while also becoming successful, efficient, and prominent while doing so. Archregent Al Smith is one such politician - a rare unsullied gem amid a sea of wolves and schemers. Born in 1873 in Manhattan to a working class Catholic Irish immigrants, Smith got a start into politics young by falling in with ‘Silent’ Charlie Murphy and the Tammany Hall group. It was in these young years that Smith solidified his reformist ideals and love for the working man - a foundation that would fuel his explosive career to new heights. Long dominating New York’s political stage as a member of the infamous Tammany Hall political machine that helped his rise and later as a leader the successful Efficiency Movement aimed at reforming the legislation that was leading his state to decay, Smith had become as famous nationwide for being one of the only successful Catholic politicians has he had been for his unending slew of successful legislation. Now, as Archregent, Smith has cast off the doubters who once whispered that the Pope would dictate his every whim, for no being or mantra guides Smith in his policy other than his dual faiths in good, honest governance and the Lord."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_DAY_DESC:0 "Few have been able to balance a deep sense of socialist justice while still holding true to pure Christian principles as well as now-Archregent Dorothy Day. Born into a middle class Anglo-Irish family in Brooklyn in 1897, Day’s own religious awakening was brought on by her own reading, practice, and study; her parents being nominal Christians at best, driving Day to find God in her own way. After this Christianity-fueled interest consumed her childhood, Day spent her adolescence living the Bohemian dream, traveling across the nation as a journalist and vagabond, picking up new influences and ideas as she bounced from one Christian sect and Socialist ideology to another in her quest to find herself. After over a decade of soul-searching, as well as dealing with the trials of new motherhood, the American Civil War, and balancing her loyalties to her Socialist contacts in the IWW and her episcopal contacts in the former-Union State, Day has grown into one of the most unique and tempered political leaders in the Holy American League. Though many still distrust her Socialist sympathies, all true believers know Day’s love of Socialism comes not from a love of dusty, dated theory, but from seeing it as the loving, egalitarian will of the Lord himself. She shall be the prophet that shows America the light of true, non-bastardized Socialism - a Socialism bathed in God’s glory and tempered through piety."
