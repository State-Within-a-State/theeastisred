communistrevoltcsp.1.desc:0 "As a result of the 'Black Monday' crisis, workers in the factories of the legation cities, started to move on strike. These strikes would be a result of economic instability, growing Chinese nationalism and the failure of better working conditions. The Governor General of the legation cities is faced with a choice, whether to use the local police for call in international aid, to suppress the strikes."

Now we have liberated the Shanghai worker! but have lost Hong Kong and Tianjin to other forces that took advantage if the chaos.

cnh_fng.2.d:0 "While we have most certainly had our differences with the Kuomintang, we must remember that we were both founded on the same basic ideals of republicanism.
