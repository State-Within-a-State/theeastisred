### Old Focuses restored by the Polar Bear ###

PAP_contra_principia:0 "Crusade Against Syndicalism"
PAP_contra_principia_desc:0 "While we would prefer peace, against the great evil of syndicalism there can be no compromise. We have put off the inevitable for far too long. Our military is ready and prepared to defend the catholic faith and liberate the land from the godless syndicalists that have desecrated the north."
PAP_fortiter_in:0 "Resolute in Execution, Gentle in Manner"
PAP_fortiter_in_desc:0 "Socialist sympathies run deep in the liberated territories and as a result, we can expect the syndicalist remnants to fight on against us for many years. If our state is to avoid collapsing into instability and chaos we must take a light but firm approach so as to de-escalate the guerrilla conflict and make sure that we do not alienate the people whom we have fought to liberate from syndicalism."
PAP_caedite_eos:0 "Kill them all and let God sort them out"
PAP_caedite_eos_desc:0 "The territories we have reclaimed from the Italians are rife with supporters of socialism, who aid and abet the syndicalist guerrillas in their fight against our state. In order to swiftly and effectively restore order and maintain control, we must be ready to crush the insurgency by whatever means necessary, even if it requires an escalation of the conflict in the short-term."

### WOW A NEW IDEA ###

PAP_antisyndicalist_crusade:0 "The Anti-Syndicalist Crusade"
PAP_antisyndicalist_crusade_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic to the north of us has been slowly decaying for years, now we stand with all of Catholicism, against this menace!"
