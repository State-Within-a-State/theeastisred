### Events ###
taiwan_info.1.desc:0 "Our story begins with the Qing dynasty's conquest of Taiwan. In 1683 the Qing annex Taiwan and make it apart of Fujian prefecture. The Qing would face rebellion from the natives much like those who controlled Taiwan before them. After the opium wars and losses to outside imperial powers the Qing's hold on Taiwan falters. Looking on this weakness, Japan goes to war with China for greater influence over Korea in 1895. For the Qing this would be a loss for them in 1896. This ends China's era in Taiwan and ushers in the Japanese era over Taiwan. \n\n§FJapanese Rule:§! \n\n After the loss to Japan, remaining Qing officials briefly proclaim the Republic of Formosa as to resist Japanese rule. Tho this would be pacified along with the dying indigenous rebels who by 1914 are mainly in the mountains. For the Great Weltkrieg Taiwanese nationals would be conscripted to fight in Asia against the Central Powers along with other Japanese colonial troops. By the end of the war, Japan had accepted a mild loss. This itself would inspire an increase in Taiwan independence violence. As a result new laws are introduced as early as 1915(before the war's end) to allow for some expression of Taiwanese cultures. But on the other hand would encourage further Japanese immigration to the island. Trying to allow a greater growth of the Japanese population on the island. \n\n After the Great Weltkrieg, the growing concern over further population discontent, as a result the Japanese government allows Taiwanese political parties to form and participate in the colonial diet. This move would also be used as a way to further integrate Taiwan into Japan. As the 20's role on, new Taiwan poltical organizations are formed, with the Home Rule Association, tho also some exiled and banned parties like the Taiwanese Communist Party and Taiwanese People's Party and KMT. These groups would initiate both violent and non violent resistance on the island. \n\n By 1936 the island faces an ever growing resistance but also greater efforts to integrate the island as the Navy and Army seek to control off the civilian government as to further their own interests. Taiwan becomes a ticking time bomb."

We have received word our a global financial crisis called 'Black Monday', as the news reached us, the stock exchange in Taipei went into a frenzy in which the economy has gone into a sudden sharp decline.

Such societies include Taiwan Minbao, written and run by Lai He, a highly respected Taiwanese literary writer, often called Taiwan's Lu Xun. Not to mention artists like Tang Tingpho, new Taiwanese art has become more viewed on the streets of Taipei. Though as there has been a rise in nationalist Taiwanese art, a growing concern amongst the Japanese colonial elite have flagged concerns that it maybe a sign of rebellion against them. Now the question has arisen to the Governor General.  Will there be a crackdown or a continuence?"

taiwan.32.title:0 "Marching for Finavenkismo"
taiwan.32.desc:0 "With our foothold in the heartland of Asia secured, many zealous esperantists within our administration have raised the question about the future of our internationalist project. While esperantists from all over the world flock to aid us in our cause of furthering the spread of the language while building our syndicalist state, some feel that this is not enough. The proponents of this more militantly cosmopolitan ideology have used the term "finavenkismo" (meaning "final victory") to refer to the inevitable triumph of the Esperanto project on the world stage. This would firmly cement Esperanto as a lingua franca of inter-ethnic communication and unity, eliminating all language barriers. While "Finavenkismo" was originally coined as a way to describe the eventual replacement of internationally used natural languages like English with Esperanto by merit of it being a more logical, linguistically perfect, and easy to learn auxiliary language, the term has been coopted by the more revolutionary minded internationalists within our government. The form of such a global super-state of esperantists is still hotly debated, though most proponents of the ideology agree that the community of Esperanto speakers is already a proto-nation in itself, only waiting to be liberated from the stranglehold of bourgeois capitalism and expanded to encompass all of Humanity. The real debate is on the presentation of this new proto-nation on the global stage, with some in the movement suggesting choosing the name of "Esperantujo" to respresent the already existing community of Esperanto speakers around the globe, finally manifesting into a true cosmopolitan utopia for all to behold. This group suggests using the traditional green-star flag. Another group of proponents suggest adopting the name of "Amikejo", literally meaning "friendship-place". This name was unofficialy adopted by a group of esperantists in the neutral condominium of Moresnet, a temporary microstate that existed as a short-lived joint administration by the Netherlands and Prussia respectively. While Moresnet was annexed by Germany in the Weltkrieg, its legacy still lives on, and many see it as a more friendly name for any non-esperanto speakers that might mistake the name "Esperantujo" for a traditional nation-state based on ethnic principles. This group perfers the Jubilee symbol over the traditional green-star flag, which it sees as too similar to common national flags. Others suggest the emphasization of our syndicalist ideology in our name as a reminder for future generations that even if Espernato triumphs, class oppression will still need to be fought. This group of ideologues naturally perfers the green-star flag but with a red background as an homage to how the original green star may have inspired the Bolsheviks to adopt a red star for soldiers in the Red Army to wear. Whatever the case, the question of embracing this radical movement still remains. Shall we remain a pacifist bulwark of esperantism in Asia and work on perfecting our internationalist utopia for all that wish to partake in it, or march to unite all of humanity under our vision of esperantist socialism?"

This itself would be scaled back in 1915 as to curb the ever growing resistance. Tho after Japan's loss in the Weltkrieg, there has been a steady incline in freedom for Taiwan but also resistance against Japan. As greater political reforms were established, political parties were formed in which would partially advocate for the continuation of Japanese rule.

TWI_rsupress_three_vices_desc:0 "The 'Three Vices' considered by the Office of the Governor-General to be archaic and unhealthy were the use of opium, foot binding, and the wearing of queues. \n\n Much like mainland China in the late nineteenth century, opium addiction was a serious social problem in Taiwan, with some statistics suggesting that over half of the ethnic Chinese population of Taiwan were users of the drug. The intentional disfigurement of female feet through binding was common to mainland Chinese and Taiwanese society at the time, and the queue hairstyle worn by the male population was forced upon Han Chinese by the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty. \n\n Ever since the Japanese occupation, Japanese rule has been trying to outlaw and ban these practices as to make Taiwan a 'Model Colony'."
