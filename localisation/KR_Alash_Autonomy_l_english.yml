POLITICS_ALIKHAN_BUKEIKHANOV_DESC:0 "Born in 1866, Alikhan Bukeikhanov was a part of the Kazakh upper class from birth - he was a direct descendant of the khans of the Bukei Horde, an autonomous Kazakh state which surrendered to the Russians in the 19th century. He acquired his higher education in St. Petersburg and grew up influenced by Kadet liberalism and moderate socialism - ultimately, this drew him to become a member of the Kadets and a diligent campaigner for Kazakh independence. After the Revolution of 1905, he split off to found the Alash Party - a moderate liberal political party advocating for an autonomous Kazakh entity in a greater Russia. This dream became real after the February Revolution of 1917, when thanks to Aleksandr Kerenskiy's support, Bukeikhanov was sent to Kazakhstan in order to organize a congress of Kazakhs in Semipalatinsk. \n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the Alash Autonomy became a battleground between several factions, although it eventually managed to assert the integrity of its territory. Having achieved the primary goal of his life, Bukeikhanov retired from his position as President and allowed democracy to take charge. Until 1925, that is. A war between the Alash Autonomy and Turkestan, and the Kolchak Coup in Russia turned the Autonomy's continued existence untenable. Bukeikhanov was placed back in charge by junior Kazakh officers and granted wide-reaching emergency powers to resolve the crisis - and ultimately, he did. Southern raids and Russian integrationist tendencies have forced him to continue the state of emergency. At this point, the 70 year old Bukeikhanov is simply... tired. Especially tired of the Russians. And as long as he is given a chance, he will not hesitate to break the Autonomy away from this rotten structure."

### Events ###
alash.1.t:0 "White Sun of the Desert"
alash.1.d:0 "Our country, despite nominally being part of Russia with autonomous status has been de facto independent from the signing of the Minsk treaty in 1920. Despite a Russian attempt in 1925 to fully integrate us into Russia while repelling an invasion from Turkestan, our status remained unchanged thanks to Admiral Kolchak's coup d'état attempt. 70-year old Alikhan Bukeikhanov, leader of the Alash party, close ally of Kerensky, has been ruling our country since 1917. Instead of promised independendent Kazakh state, Alash Autonomy exists under deep economic dependency on Russia. However, with Russian economy in a state of recession, the situation in Alash-Orda is destabilizing as well."
alash.1.a:0 "Wake up, Kazakh!"

alash.300.t:0 "Third All-Kazakh Congress"
alash.300.d:0 "The Russian Republic is in chaos,society is radicalizing and the economy is falling. Alikhan Bukeikhanov has announced that the Third All-Kazakh Congress should be held immediately in order to solve some up to date issues. On the one hand, Alikhan is hoping to finally break away from Russia and secure Kazakh independence. But on the other hand, cutting ties with Russia can lead to serious problems, both political and economical. Moreover, being almost 70 years old, Bukeikhanov is thinking of retirement and quiet rest somewhere near the Balkash lake. There are also talks about the retirement of the old leader in the government, especially amongs the Young Alash wing of the party. But the instability, which can be caused by retirement can play a joke on us and let the most radical factions seize the power."
alash.300.a:0 "We must choose wisely."

alash.301.t:0 "Society Radicalized"
alash.301.d:0 "The decision of Bukeikhanov to remain loyal to Russia has provoked a massive unrest among the delegates. Moreover, the socialist party of QTKP is looking forward to use the instability to seize the power and the Orenburg Cossacks, led by Dutov, are ready to establish a firm hand rule if needed."
alash.301.a:0 "We should deal with unrest!"

alash.302.t:0 "The Delegates Demand Resignation Of Bukeikhanov"
alash.302.d:0 "The Delegates believe that Bukeikhanov is too old to handle the power in his hands. His decision to remain loyal to Russia has been a devastating choice and perhaps the worst way to end the career. Everything depends on Bukeikhanov now."
alash.302.a:0 "Bukeikhanov retires."
alash.302.b:0 "Bukeikhanov refuses to retire."

alash.303.t:0 "Resignation of Bukeikhanov"
alash.303.d:0 "Bukeikhanov has delivered a speech on the Congress - the one that will be known as his last speech as a politician. He has announced his resignation after serving Alash Autonomy for 19 years as a prime-minister. The snap elections will be held soon. "
alash.303.a:0 "Perhaps it will solve the political crisis."

alash.304.t:0 "Kazakh National Elections"
alash.304.d:0 "The snap elections were held and the winner is..."
alash.304.a:0 "Social-Democrat wing of the Alash party."
alash.304.b:0 "Bukeikhanov's successor secures Alash majority."
alash.304.c:0 "Shura-i-Ulema victorous."

alash.305.t:0 "Resignation?"
alash.305.d:0 "Bukeikhanov is rather old and some people in the government thinks that he can barely hold the nation together. Perhaps it is time for him to retire?"
alash.305.a:0 "The time has come"
alash.305.b:0 "Oh come now, old age just means wisdom!"

alash.306.t:0 "The Resignation of Bukeikhanov"
alash.306.d:0 "Following calls for him to step down, Bukeikhanov has formally resgined from his post. To replace him, snap elections have been called to fill his place as soon as possible."
alash.306.a:0 "A long time coming..."   

alash.30.t:0 "Socialist Riot in Almaty"
alash.30.d:0 "Latest reports from Almaty say that a large crowd of socialists is sieging administrative buildings demanding the government to give power to the Soviets. Ataman Dutov with his cossacks has arrived in Almaty the next day and tried to restore order in the city. Eventually..."
alash.30.a:0 "The Revolutionaries declare soviet power across Kazakhstan!"
alash.30.c:0 "Bukeikhanov has managed to secure his rule with the help of cossacks!"
alash.30.b:0 "Ataman Dutov restores order and proclaims himself dictator!"

alash.35.t:0 "Independence for Alash Autonomy?"
alash.35.d:0 "The main issue, discussed at the Third All-Kazakh Congress was if Alash Autonomy should finally declare independence from Russia. While half of the ministers and senators claim that the time has come to throw off the chains of Russian oppression and end the farce of Alash-Orda being part of Russia, the other half, however, consisting mostly of ethnic Russians and Cossacks, believe that there will be no Kazakhstan without Russian assistance."
alash.35.a:0 "No, we must remain loyal to Russia."
alash.35.b:0 "Declare full independence from Russia."

alash.36.t:0 "The Ethinc Problem"
alash.36.d:0 "Our population is divided into three separate communities: Kazakh and Kyrgyz people, the Russians and the Cossacks. However, with the new policy of 'Kazakhization', the new Alash government is hoping to strenghten Kazakh national identity without oppressing the other social groups. However, it is likely that Russians and Cossack won't like it."
alash.36.a:0 "It is the country of Kazakhs, after all!"

alash.41.t:0 "United Muftiate of Alash-Orda"
alash.41.d:0 "Since the Second All-Kazakh Congress in 1918, we tried to establish an independent Muftiate of muslim Kazakhs. However, with our country being officially secular and being a Russian dependency, the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly has been the supreme clerical institute in our country. With our independence from the Russians secured, we can finally establish the Mufiate of our own."
alash.41.a:0 "The less influence Russia has on us - the better."

alash.42.t:0 "Shura-i-Islam"
alash.42.d:0 "Shura-i-Islam is 'Islam Council' in Arabian. It is a political and social movement in Turkestan and Alash-Orda which is closely connected to a national-democratic cultural-enlightenment movement of Jadidism.\nJadidism is an ideology of Islamic modernisation, that the muslim populations of former Russian Empire can adopt norms and principles of liberal democracy. The Shura-i-Islam has contributed much towards educating the Kazakh people, many schools have been opened on their initiative. We must have one of Shura-i-Islam members in our government and continue to modernise Kazakhstan."
alash.42.a:0 "Towards the Future!"

alash.43.t:0 "On the other side of Syr Darya"
alash.43.d:0 "On the opposite bank of the river Syr Darya lies the Islamic Federation of Turkestan - a reactionary and militarized country which shares common origins and culture with us. Though it's unlikely we can persuade the Khan of Turkestan to unite with us into a single federation of Central Asian peoples, there is only one way left to liberate Turkestani people."
alash.43.a:0 "We are not ready for war..."
alash.43.b:0 "Liberate the Turkestani peoples!"

alash.44.t:0 "Central Asian Federation"
alash.44.d:0 "The peoples of Turkestan have finally liberated themselves from reactionary rule of Mohammed Alim Khan. We should unie with them for the best future's sake."
alash.44.a:0 "Send our offer to [TRK.GetNameDef]."

alash.45.t:0 "An Offer From Alash-Orda"
alash.45.d:0 "The government of Alash-Orda has sent us an offer to create united Central Asian Federation. While this decision will benefit both of our countries, we are risking to lose our sovereignity."
alash.45.a:0 "Agree to the proposal."
alash.45.b:0 "Our independence is sacred!"

alash.46.t:0 "[TRK.GetNameDef] Accepted the Offer"
alash.46.d:0 "The government of Turkestan has accepted our offer!"
alash.46.a:0 "Form the Central Asian Federation!"

alash.47.t:0 "[TRK.GetNameDef Declined the Offer"
alash.47.d:0 "The government of Turkestan has declined our offer to unite. What shall we do?"
alash.47.a:0 "Back down."
alash.47.b:0 "Then we will force them to join us!"

alash.48.t:0 "Language Issue"
alash.48.d:0 "After the Russian Civil War, the Alash party has transfered the Kazakh langauge, which was mostly in Arabic writing into Latin one. However, since our government looks forward to cooperating with Russia, it will be better for us to adopt Cyrillic alphabet."
alash.48.a:0 "Start the reform."

alash.49.t:0 "Orenburg Cossack Host"
alash.49.d:0 "While Orenburg is not located in Alash Autonomy, the Ataman of Orenburg Cossacks, Dutov, is a close friend of Vasily Balabanov. He was one of the first political leaders in Russia to recognize our state and now his Cossack troops are disposed in Alash, securing our state. However, he did not recognize the leadership of Kerensky after the Civil War. The Kazakh army almost entirely depends on Cossacks and the assistance of Ataman Dutov is vital for our state. We should think of granting Cossack special status in Alash-Orda, the one that will be much higher than of a regular Kazakh."
alash.49.a:0 "Grant Special Status to Cossacks"

alash.50.t:0 "Legacy of von Kaufmann"
alash.50.d:0 "Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufmann was the first Governor-General of Russian Turkestan. Even though the territories of Alash-Orda were absorbed in Russian Empire earlier, than ones of our southern neighbour, we should remember his influence in the region. Von Kaufmann was the one who brought civillization to Central Asia, the one who contributed much to social and economic development of the region. Von Kaufmann should become a national hero and a symbol of our friendship with Russia."
alash.50.a:0 "We should remember him"

alash.51.t:0 "The State of Economy"
alash.51.d:0 "Our economy is in a poor state now. Our huge dependency on Russia in terms of trade and economy has brought us to a situation that barely any industry is developed in our contry. We have a rural economy, but the majority of our land is a desert. We should find new ways to improve our economy and deal with effects of Russian crisis and Black Monday."
alash.51.a:0 "Let's improve our economy!"

alash.52.t:0 "Establish New Economic Ties"
alash.52.d:0 "With our distancing from Russia, our economy has radically dropped. We should find new trade partners and establish new economic connections. Hopefully, this will help our economy. The government has approved several delegations in Persia, India and Ottoman Empire."
alash.52.a:0 "Send delegations"

alash.53.t:0 "Economic Ties With Alash-Orda?"
alash.53.d:0 "The Alash government has sent us a delegation in order to establish economic ties between our countries. How should we react?"
alash.53.a:0 "We can hardly cope on our own"
alash.53.b:0 "It would be beneficial, agreed!"

alash.54.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refused"
alash.54.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our offer."
alash.54.a:0 "Catastrophic!"

alash.55.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Agreed"
alash.55.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to trade with us."
alash.55.a:0 "Great!"

alash.56.t:0 "Russian Economy Collapsed"
alash.56.d:0 "The Black Monday has finally hit Russia and us as well. As our country is dependent upon Russian economy, we already feel the first consequences of a world crisis."
alash.56.a:0 "Something must be done!"

alash.57.t:0 "Union with [DKB.GetName]?"
alash.57.d:0 "The social class of cossacks, though always having special privelege from the Russian government, has been separated and humbled into the dust by the failed republican Russian government. We shall unite our armies with the Don-Kuban cossack to save Holy Russia from the tyranny of socialists and liberals."
alash.57.a:0 "United we are stronger."

alash.58.t:0 "Union with [ALO.GetName]?"
alash.58.d:0 "The government of Ataman Dutov has offered us to unite our armies and government in our struggle against Russia."
alash.58.b:0 "We won't be absorbed by this crazy ataman!"

alash.59.t:0 "Treaty of Almaty"
alash.59.d:0 "We have an offer to the Far-Eastern government: we shall mutually guarantee our countries' existence and unite our forces if Russia will try to declare war on us. The alliance should be created between two our nations."

alash.60.t:0 "An Offer from Ataman Dutov"
alash.60.d:0 "The government of Ataman Dutov has offered us an alliance against Petrograd regime."
alash.60.b:0 "Why should we die for this crazy Ataman?"

alash.2.t:0 "Alash autonomous region declares independence!"
alash.2.d:0 "Terrible news! Our autonomous region of Alash-Orda has decided to use the political chaos in Russia following the assassination of Kerensky to sever almost all ties with Russia and declare independence. While many hotheads in the General Staff are demanding immediate action, ongoing chaos prevents us from responding to this treachery. It seems that we must let Alash-Orda be. For now..."
alash.2.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."

alash.3.t:0 "The Peoples of Alash Orda"
alash.3.d:0 "Our population is divided into three separate communities, and if it is to remain stable, it is necessary for our government to favour one of these groups above the others. Make this decision carefully, as it may lead to international complications."
alash.3.a:0 "The Kazakhs and Kyrgyz people: they make up the majority of our population."
alash.3.b:0 "The ethnic Russians: they control the economy."
alash.3.c:0 "Our security depends upon the Cossacks."

alash.4.t:0 "The Alash Orda's Cossacks are oppressed!"
alash.4.d:0 "The leaders of the Kazakh Republic's Cossack communities have complained to us that they are oppressed under the government's ethnical policy."
alash.4.b:0 "Pledge to defend the security of the Cossacks."
alash.4.c:0 "Send them away: this is no concern of ours."

alash.5.t:0 "The Don-Kuban Union Defends the Cossack Community"
alash.5.d:0 "The leaders of our country's Cossack garrisons, including influential Ataman of the Orenburg Cossack Host, Aleksandr Dutov, have been encouraged to secede and join the Don-Kuban Union, where they feel their interests will be better protected! What should we do?"
alash.5.a:0 "We shall fight all who threaten the unity of our state!"
alash.5.b:0 "Maintain links with the Cossack leaders."
alash.5.c:0 "Ignore them."

alash.6.t:0 "The Alash Orda's Kyrgyz people are oppressed!"
alash.6.d:0 "The leaders of Alash Orda's Kyrgyz communities have complained to us that they are oppressed under the government's ethnical policy."
alash.6.a:0 "We shall fight to liberate our Islamic brothers!"
alash.6.b:0 "Try to establish control over Pishpek"
alash.6.c:0 "Do nothing."

alash.7.t:0 "The Alash Orda's Russians are oppressed!"
alash.7.d:0 "The leaders of Alash Orda's Russian community have complained to us that they are oppressed under the government's ethnical policy."
alash.7.a:0 "Encourage them to secede and re-join Russia."
alash.7.b:0 "Pledge to defend the Russian community."
alash.7.c:0 "The Kazakhs have overstepped the mark: this means war!"
alash.7.e:0 "Do nothing."

alash.8.t:0 "Russia is stirring up separatism!"
alash.8.d:0 "The resurgent Russian state is encouraging our ethnic Russian community to secede from our country and be incorporated into a greater Russia. What shall we do?"
alash.8.a:0 "We shall fight to maintain the integrity of our lands!"
alash.8.b:0 "Let them go, but maintain our interests in the area."
alash.8.c:0 "We can do nothing against the Russians."

alash.9.t:0 "The Return of the Tsar"
alash.9.d:0 "A new Tsar has been crowned in Russia! Our powerful Russian population is very pleased, and are considering whether they should direct our state into closer relations with the new Empire."
alash.9.a:0 "We shall serve the new Tsar, but on our own terms."
alash.9.b:0 "All Russians and Kazakhs must be ruled by the Tsar."
alash.9.c:0 "He is the Tsar of Russia, not of Kazakhstan!"

alash.10.t:0 "The Alash Orda's resolve"
alash.10.d:0 "The Alash Orda has offered to serve us and accept the authority of the new Tsar, but ask for us to respect their independence. How should we respond?"
alash.10.a:0 "We welcome the return of our allies."
alash.10.b:0 "We must decline their offer politely."
alash.10.c:0 "Upstarts! Your lands are rightfully Russian lands!"

alash.11.t:0 "The Submission of the Kazakhs"
alash.11.d:0 "The Russians who dominate the Alash Orda's political and economic affairs have decided to ask for their state to be incorporated into the Russian Empire. What should we do?"
alash.11.a:0 "Welcome their return."
alash.11.b:0 "We need friends, not serfs: you may serve as an independent nation."
alash.11.c:0 "We must decline - Central Asia is a wasteland we have no need of."

alash.12.t:0 "The Alash Orda's Resolve"
alash.12.d:0 "Despite being dominated by ethnic Russians, Alash Orda has proclaimed that they owe nothing to the Russian Empire, and the new Tsar. How should we respond?"
alash.12.a:0 "They have a point - he's just the Tsar of Russia."
alash.12.b:0 "Send gifts to show the Tsar's generosity."
alash.12.c:0 "What the Tsar has given them, the Tsar shall take away!"

alash.13.t:0 "Russia Resurgent"
alash.13.d:0 "Our Russian neighbours seem to be taking a more active role in global affairs. We should approach them while they are busy elsewhere, before they decide to deal with us themselves."
alash.13.a:0 "We are willing to submit to the Russians for security."
alash.13.b:0 "We should approach the Russians as allies."
alash.13.c:0 "Russia may do what it wants: we will follow our own course."

alash.14.t:0 "The Kazakh's Resolve"
alash.14.d:0 "In the interests of its security, Alash Orda has offered to become an autonomous Republic under Russian domination. How should we respond?"
alash.14.a:0 "Excellent: Alash-Orda shall be a Russian colony."
alash.14.b:0 "We are sorry, our interests lie elsewhere."
alash.14.c:0 "Autonomous?!? No, Russia shall rule the Kazakhs directly!"

alash.15.t:0 "An alliance with the Kazakhs?"
alash.15.d:0 "Alash Orda has offered to enter into a full alliance with Russia, to promote stability in the region."
alash.15.a:0 "Yes, Russia needs a strong ally in central Asia."
alash.15.b:0 "Russia has no need of an alliance with the Kazakhs."
alash.15.c:0 "Stability shall only reach Central Asia when it is ruled by Russia!"

alash.16.t:0 "The Resolve of Alash Orda"
alash.16.d:0 "Alash Orda has asserted that they are free from Russia's sphere of influence! What should we do?"
alash.16.a:0 "We are strong enough to ignore them."
alash.16.b:0 "Send gifts to bring them on our side."
alash.16.c:0 "The Kazakhs are wrong: they occupy Russian lands!"
alash.16.e:0 "Russia shall prove where its interests lie: we shall march to Alma-Ata!"

alash.17.t:0 "The Tsar Comes to the Alma-Ata!"
alash.17.d:0 "The Tsar has come to Alma-Ata to be formally recognised as the Overlord of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Steppes. A grand parade of our nation's Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Cossacks, and Russians has been organised, highlighting the diversity of the Tsar's new subjects! All rejoice!"
alash.17.a:0 "God Save The Tsar!"

alash.18.t:0 "The Tsar Comes to Alma-Ata"
alash.18.d:0 "To fulfil the agreement with Alash Orda, the Tsar has come to Alma-Ata to be formally recognised as the Overlord of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Steppes. A grand parade of Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Cossacks, and Russians has been organised, highlighting the diversity of the Tsar's new subjects! The whole ceremony has been relayed across the Empire by radio broadcast, and our subjects have flocked to watch the newsreels in the cinema!"
alash.18.a:0 "God Save The Tsar! A Triumph of Propaganda!"

alash.19.t:0 "Help from Russia?"
alash.19.d:0 "We are faced with the threat of annihilation at the hands of Turkestan. Russia may be willing to help us, but we may have to make serious concessions. It may however be the only way to save ourselves from rule by Turkestan's fanatics..."
alash.19.a:0 "Beg the Russians for military aid."
alash.19.b:0 "Offer to submit to the Russians."
alash.19.c:0 "We shall fight on our own!"

alash.20.t:0 "Alash Orda desires aid"
alash.20.d:0 "Alash Orda is fighting for its life against Turkestan, and has sent a representative to us to beg for military assistance. This could be an excellent opportunity to cement our authority in Central Asia."
alash.20.a:0 "They may have war material and volunteers."
alash.20.b:0 "We shall fight on the side of the Kazakhs."
alash.20.c:0 "We have no interests in Central Asia."
alash.20.e:0 "The Kazakhs are too weak: Russia shall take over their lands."

alash.21.t:0 "Aid from Russia!"
alash.21.d:0 "The Russians have sent troops and volunteers to help us in the fight against Turkestan!"
alash.21.a:0 "Great!"

alash.22.t:0 "The Submission of the Kazakhs"
alash.22.d:0 "The Kazakhs are in danger of being eliminated by the forces of Turkestan. They have come to the conclusion that only by being incorporated into Russia will they be able to live in peace and freedom. If we accept them, we will be fighting Turkestan ourselves..."
alash.22.a:0 "We shall welcome the Kazakhs and defend their rights."
alash.22.b:0 "We cannot risk such entanglements."

alash.23.t:0 "War in Central Asia"
alash.23.d:0 "The recent outbreak of hostilities in Central Asia is worrying to say the least, and brings great destabilisation to our frontiers. The Kazakhs have recently proclaimed that they shall fight on their own against Turkestan, but it seems that they are too weak to survive for very long. This is an opportunity we could use to extend our influence into traditionally Russian lands..."
alash.23.a:0 "We have no interests in Central Asia."
alash.23.b:0 "Should Turkestan come near our borders, we shall fight them."
alash.23.c:0 "The Kazakhs are too weak: Russia shall take over their lands."
alash.23.e:0 "Only Russian armies can bring order to Central Asia!"

alash.27.t:0 "More Than An Autonomy"
alash.27.d:0 "At long last, we are totally free from foreign control. It is time to drop the word 'autonomy' all together and become the 'Orda' envisioned decades ago."
alash.27.a:0 "Hurrah!"

alash.29.t:0 "Revolution in Russia"
alash.29.d:0 "The Russian Republic has fallen into chaos followed by socialist revolution. Our government believes that socialist sympathies will only strengthen in Alash-Orda now. We might leave it as it is, or invite cossacks to secure our internal situation."
alash.29.a:0 "Leave it as it is."
alash.29.b:0 "Enlarge the powers vested in the Cossack Host."


alash.31.t:0 "Reconciliation with Soviet Russia?"
alash.31.d:0 "With the successful revolution in Kazakhstan, we must install close ties with our closest ally - Russia."
alash.31.a:0 "Send them a non-aggression treaty."
alash.31.b:0 "We are on our own."

alash.32.t:0 "Reconciliation with Don-Kuban and Transamur?"
alash.32.d:0 "Once, about 20 years ago, Ataman Dutov was the first to recognize Kolchak as the Supreme Ruler of Russia. He still believe in Kolchak's ability to stabilize Russia. With this in mind, many within the government think we should reach out to Transamur and the Cossacks of west and sign non-aggression treaties, to advance our ties. The question remains, shall we?"
alash.32.a:0 "Send them treaties."
alash.32.b:0 "We are on our own."

alash.33.t:0 "A request from [ALO.GetName]"
alash.33.d:0 "A recently installed government in [ALO.GetName] has sent us a telegram about installing closer economic ties and becoming allied with each other. How should we respond?"
alash.33.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
alash.33.b:0 "We shall conquer this land, not ally it!"

alash.34.t.agree:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agreed"
alash.34.t.disagree:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused"
alash.34.d:0 "The government of [From.GetName] has officially sent us a response about our treaty."
alash.34.a:0 "A toast to our new friends!"
alash.34.b:0 "Unfortunate..."

alash.100.t:0 "Join [SOV.GetNameDefCap]?"
alash.100.d:0 "The recent victories of socialists in Russian and Kazakhstan have shown close ties between our countries. The new government of Kazakhstan believes that we should join [SOV.GetName] in our common struggle against imperalists and capitalists."
alash.100.a:0 "Join the Big Brother"

alash.61.t:0 "Cossacks Overthrow Our Government!"
alash.61.d:0 "Our policy towards cossacks has angered their community in our country. Today, several armed cossack garrisons entered the capital city, led by Ataman Dutov. After a short battle with the local police force, he arrested the government and proclaimed himself dictator of the nation."
alash.61.a:0 "Long live Ataman Dutov!"
