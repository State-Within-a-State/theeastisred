## Two Sicilies ##
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last 20 years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a sovereign nation and the leader of the Italian Federation, at least in an interim fashion. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towards His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."
POLITICS_JULIUS_EVOLA_DESC:0 "Baron Julius Evola is one of the most controversial political philosophers in Europe and, perhaps, the world. Devoting himself to an ideology that has been named "Radical Traditionalism", "Legionarism" and "Ultra-Rightism", Evola believes that modern society is in the age that Hinduism refers to as "Kali Yuga", or an age of darkess and choas. Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."
POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_III_DESC:0 "The Former King of Italy and Head of the main branch of the House of Savoy has returned from his long exile to find an army of fanatical monarchists at his disposal. He is utterly an admirer of Julius Evola, now his High Chancellor, for making the seemingly impossible come true and bringing to life his aspirations. It helps that the King is also known to harbor reactionary beliefs which grow increasingly right-wing with Evola at his side and the Socialist enemy in the north. He hopes that he and Legion can accomplish the seemingly impossible and defeat the traditional enemies to his power, the republicans, the socialists and the Catholic Church."
