### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_AHMAD_SHAH_QAJAR_DESC:0 "Installed as Shah of Iran at the age of eleven, it could be argued that Ahmad Shah was always at the whim of the Majilis, only a figurehead in a nation still struggling with the aftermath of the events of the 1920's and beforehand. Though he would attempt to repair and unite the nation, his efforts would almost always collapse. Though the most turbulent part of his reign is arguably at an end, that does not mean there are not those wishing to see the Shah removed - whether it be Democrats who wish to establish a republic, Royalists who want install a new monarch that can surpass Ahmad Shah's abilities, or even Socialists who want to bring about a socialist revolution akin to the one declared in 1920. It seems, with all these enemies against the Shah, and his health in steady decline, that it is only a matter of time before chaos erupts across the nation."
POLITICS_HASSAN_MIRZA_QAJAR_DESC:0 "As the Crown-Prince of Iran, Hassan Mirza lived in his older brother’s shadow ever since he was installed as Shah, and had little influence in the politics of Iran during the early years of Ahmad Shah’s rule. From a young age, he would be exposed to the countless conflicts and civil uprisings that plagued the nation, from the Jangali Uprising to foreign intervention from the British and Russia, all the while his brother would seemingly do little to stop it all.  Over many years however, he would slowly build up the political, military, and diplomatic connections he desired, and attained the respect that was fit for the brother and heir of the Shah. Now, with his ascension to the Sun Throne, he has reached the very top of the Iranian political world, and it is certain he will not squander the opportunity to bring Iran into the modern age as a force to be reckoned with."
POLITICS_SAYYED_HASAN_TAQIZADEH_DESC:0 "Taqizadeh, despite being known as one of the biggest and most influential advocates for modernisation and constitutionalism, came from a family of clergymen who were descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, and it had seemed that he would follow in the footsteps of his family. However, his interest and experience with Western democracy and modern enlightenment caused him to follow a new career into politics, where he soon became a strong advocate against the Qajars and for sweeping reforms to the nation in order for it to flourish in the 20th century. With the revolution that has swept the nation, and the deposition of the Qajars, Taqizadeh has formed a new government that will seek to recreate Iran as a nation of true democracy and prosperity."
POLITICS_IRAJ_ESKANDARI_DESC:0 "As a Qajar Prince, Eskandari was given an education in France where he was exposed to the young syndicalist nation and its socialist teachings, to which he had soon begun to admire. He would link up with other Iranian socialists in the country, and even some of the key figures of the Edalat Party who had been forced to flee after Ahmad Shah's attempted assassination, and the subsequent crackdown of socialism. Though he was unable to return home, he would slowly become one of the more popular figures of socialism in Iran, especially as the movement would begin to see greater popularity amongst the workers and peasants of Iran. With the Edalat Party now in power, Eskandari has been appointed as President of the new Socialist Republic, promising greater freedoms for peasants and unions, and the redistribution of wealth to the common people."

pers.1.t:0 "Introduction to [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.1.d: "Iran endured its own century of humiliations before, during and after the Weltkrieg. A chess piece in the Great Game between Russia and Britain, ruled by the weak and incapable Qajar dynasty, it began the 20th century with a Constitutional Revolution, a change in monarchs, a period of fragile Constitutionalist governments and then finally being dragged into the Weltkrieg against its will. Occupied by the Entente and Central Powers, Persis was pillaged and battered, and even as the war came to a halt in Europe it did not cease here uprisings and unrest became a daily occurrence, the Iranian Socialist Republic in the north being the most prominent. \n\nThese pressures culminated in a backlash against the monarchy, seen as the root of Iran's weakness and ills. The rapidly radicalising Majlis turned against the Shah, and when ordered to disperse the legislature, the army stood by its side, leading to the creation of the Republic of Iran. This Republic was fragile, however, and turned increasingly socialist, sparking a civil war waged by Qajar loyalists, supported by separatists in the West, the Ottomans and the German Empire. \n\nIn the midst of the uprising, President Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi was overthrown by the army, and a new government led by Mohammad Tadayyon finished waging the war. The Republic endured, but at a price-loss of Khuzestan in the Tehran Conference and national humiliation. Politics in Iran remained unstable after the war Tadayyon was replaced by Solemian Eskandri and the Socialist' Party in 1929 in a democratic election, before the coup in 1934 which failed due to Kerensky's pressure and National workers strikes. Solemian's government stood in the face of the Authoritarian coup commanded by Teymourtash and The Ulema. \n\ndecades of humiliation and an Iran barely standing..."

While initially we had planned to take away the bear due to military regulations, we have begun to reconsider, as troops stationed in the fort have petitioned for it to stay. We have decided to allow the bear to stay at the fort for the time being to increase moral. The troops have decided to name him Rostam."
pers.12.a:0 "What a peculiar occurrence."

pers.13.t:0 "Rostam the bear"
pers.13.d:0 "Rostam the bear has been growing up alongside our army pretty well. Due to his owner being transferred to the 2nd Artillery supply company, Rostam was transferred to the company and has ever since been befriending its troops. They have taken the bear as their own mascot and it even helps them with carrying their artillery."
pers.13.a:0 "Truly a bizarre occurrence in the history of the [PER.GetAdjective] army."

pers.14.t:0 "Problems with Rostam"
pers.14.d:0 "Sadly, due to financial problems, the owner of Rostam is looking to sell him to the highest bidder. This will no doubt cause a loss of moral for the 2nd Artillery supply company. Several high ranking generals have began discussing the situation and we must decide what to do."
pers.14.a:0 "We have more important matters than a silly bear!"
pers.14.b:0 "We must purchase Rostam!"

pers.15.t:0 "Rostam has been sold"
pers.15.d:0 "Rostam the bear was sold to a Polish merchant passing through [PER.GetNameDef]. It seems the Polish merchant caravan was deeply amused by the military bear and as soon as they found out he was up for sale they purchased him. They have even began to call him a new name, Wojtek."
pers.15.a:0 "Alas, Wojtek's fate shall take him to Poland."

pers.16.t:0 "Oil Nationalisation"
pers.16.d:0 "In the year 1925, after the evacuation of the British garrison in Khuzestan and the fall of their empire, the Majlis, in celebration of the reunification of Khuzestan, nationalized the oil industry. Each year [PER.GetAdjective]s celebrate this event and let it be a reminder to them to not allow anyone take control of their oil and land."
pers.16.a:0 "[PER.GetNameDefCap] will remain strong!"



### Decisions ###

PER_coring_conquered_territory:0 "Integration of New Territory"
PER_core_afghan_land:0 "Integrate Herat"
PER_core_afghan_land_desc:0 "Now that we have gained control of our lands in Afghanistan again, we can begin to integrate it into [PER.GetNameDef]. However, it is going to take decades to fully intergrate the eastern area due to their Pashtun ethnic majority. In the west of Afghanistan, the population is majority Hazara, a group we can more easily integrate into our nation. The Pashtuns most likely will resist our attempts, but eventually they will accept our leadership."
PER_core_azerbaijani_land:0 "Intergrate Azerbaijan"
PER_core_azerbaijani_land_desc:0 "Azerbaijan is now under our direct rule again. After some time, most Azerbaijanis will give up on their dream of their own state, and will accept our leadership. Although there will be some resistance to our rule, we have a very large Azerbaijani minority, and the nation of Azerbaijan only existed for a few decades. Therefore, Azerbaijani resistance will be weak and futile."
PER_core_baluchistan:0 "Integrate Baluchistan"
PER_core_baluchistan_desc:0 "The state of Baluchistan has been returned to our control. The Baluchi people are a large ethnic group in our nation, so we should be able to integrate the Baluchi population fully into our state. However, they will resist our rule, due to the fact that they have been under Indian control for much time."
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_category:0 "Western Expansion"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision:0 "The Ottomans are weak!"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision_desc:0 "Recently, Egypt has declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans have been dominating the Middle East for centuries, and now it is our moment to seek revenge. They have been showing weakness since even before the beginning of the first Weltkrieg, and now it is our time to put an end to the sick man that is the Ottomans."
PER_country_namechange_decision:0 "Change our name to Iran"
PER_country_namechange_decision_desc:0 "Pressure is mounting from modernizing elements within our nation to push for the international community to refer to us as "Iran", the name we use for ourselves, over the outdated exonym "Persia". Exactly why this is a matter of such debate, we're not really sure."
PER_IRAN:0 "The name of our country is Iran"
