crete.1.t:0 "The Cretan Question"
crete.1.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete. Crete is larger and harder to defend than Malta, and the upkeep is higher as well. To help with our deficit, it has been proposed that we essentially sell the island to either the Ottomans or the Greeks. What shall we do?"
crete.1.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence."
crete.1.b:0 "Offer Crete to the Ottomans."
crete.1.c:0 "Offer Crete to the Greeks."

crete.2.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"

crete.8.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete.8.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As the Cretan State was originally created because of our weak grasp on the island, the majority of the ministers are pushing to just shuffling the government in Crete.

crete.9.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete.9.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda.

What shall we do?"

crete.10.a:0 "Good riddance!"
crete.10.b:0 "The Enosis brotherhood coups the government!"

crete.11.t:0 "Crete is Greek once more!"
crete.11.d:0 "With the Germans embroiled in their war with the Syndicalists, our brothers in Crete took the chance to rise against the Germans!"
crete.11.a:0 "Hurrah for the second Enosis!"
