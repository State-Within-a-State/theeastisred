syndicalistchina.14.d:0 "After the win for Chen Duxui and his allies in the national congress, his faction starts to fall apart. Chen's faction consists for two sides. The hardliners lead by Duxui, in which apply ideas of orthodox syndicalism, with emphasis on helping the merchant unions and communes in their development and funding. Whilst the other faction is a the united front faction. This faction is a group that holds together the Left Kuomintang with the CSP. Chen Gongbo leads the faction and asks for further cooperation between the two parties for the growth of a new socialist China. Issue being Duxui's hardliner's who seek to distance from the KMT due the ideological dogmatism that exists within the hardliner faction, due to rumour of a possible KMT coup due to the increasing control over the military and growth of their youth leagues."
syndicalistchina.15.d:0 "The KMT has caught wind of our purge and now has decided to split from the united front and form their own government in Wuhan. Issue of the CSP is that a large amount of their organized units were under KMT control and had split along with the KMT as they too feared that they would be purged. Now the CSP has a large number of irregular militia that were created from the formation of communal militia. The Chinese Civil War has Begun."
syndicalistchina.16.d:0 "Alas, our comrades in the Central Military Commission have discovered a plot by the CSP to purge us from the government in order to better secure their power and dominance. We should have never trusted Duxui from the start. The united front has been broken. Duxui shall pay for his crimes at the gates of Nanjing. May we, the true follower's of Dr. Sun lead China's revolutionary republican path to a better future! The guns have clashed in Nanchang..."
