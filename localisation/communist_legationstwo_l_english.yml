He talks of a world China that is ruled by a wise man known as Mao Zedong. He iterates in his timeline Mao Zedong has won over China and started to further free the masses. tho he says with a sad tone, that Mao died and he himself has takenover, but still needs to eliminate the enemies in of his past in order to continue his revolutionary timeline. \n\nSoon dozens of soldiers pop out of a weird light and over power the local military and police forces. Sooner or later and the legations is secured under Hongwen."

syndicalistchina.14.d:0 "After the win for Chen Duxui and his allies in the national congress, his faction starts to fall apart. Chen's faction consists for two sides. The hardliners lead by Duxui, in which apply ideas of orthodox syndicalism, with emphasis on helping the merchant unions and communes in their development and funding. Whilst the other faction is a the united front faction. This faction is a group that holds together the Left Kuomintang with the CSP. Chen Gongbo leads the faction and asks for further cooperation between the two parties for the growth of a new socialist China. Issue being Duxui's hardliner's who seek to distance from the KMT due the ideological dogmatism that exists within the hardliner faction, due to rumour of a possible KMT coup due to the increasing control over the military and growth of their youth leagues."
syndicalistchina.15.d:0 "The KMT has caught wind of our purge and now has decided to split from the united front and form their own government in Wuhan. Issue of the CSP is that a large amount of their organized units were under KMT control and had split along with the KMT as they too feared that they would be purged. Now the CSP has a large number of irregular militia that were created from the formation of communal militia. The Chinese Civil War has Begun."
syndicalistchina.16.d:0 "Alas, our comrades in the Central Military Commission have discovered a plot by the CSP to purge us from the government in order to better secure their power and dominance. We should have never trusted Duxui from the start. The united front has been broken. Duxui shall pay for his crimes at the gates of Nanjing. May we, the true follower's of Dr. Sun lead China's revolutionary republican path to a better future! The guns have clashed in Nanchang..."

cnh_fng.2.t:0 "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Negotiate"
cnh_fng.2.d:0 "While we have most certainly had our differences with the Kuomintang, we must remember that we were both founded on the same basic ideals of republicanism. While this might be true, we must also keep in mind that their form of republicanism has been corrupted by syndicalist elements. However, they could prove to be a useful ally against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. How should we reply?"
cnh_fng.2.a:0 "We will hear them out"

cnh_fng.6.t:0 "Fate of the [QIE.GetNameDefCap]"
cnh_fng.6.d:0 "The pressing issue of these negotiations have been on what to do with [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. We have two options. We could propose that we along with Fengtian invade [QIE.GetNameDefCap] together, or we could propose that Fengtian not Intervene in an invasion into [QIE.GetNameDefCap]."

cnh_fng.7.d:0 "The delegates in Nanjing have proposed to us an alliance against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. While this would almost certainly insure the destruction of [QIE.GetNameDefCap], we may be forced to share the spoils of war with the Kuomintang."
cnh_fng.7.a:0 "The [QIE.GetNameDefCap] must fall. We will work with the Kuomintang."
cnh_fng.7.b:0 "We can take out the [QIE.GetNameDefCap] by ourselves"

cnh_fng.8.t:0 "The Kuomintang Suggest We Keep Out of the Upcoming War"
cnh_fng.8.d:0 "While in Nanjing, the Kuomintang delegates have suggested to us that we keep out of an upcoming war with [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. While this is most certainly an insult to Marshal Zhang, we must remember that the Kuomintang is one of the most powerful factions in China and our refusal could very well anger them."

cnh_fng.8.b:0 "You have to be joking"

cnh_fng.9.t:0 "Fengtian Agrees to the Plan"
