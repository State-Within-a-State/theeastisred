PHI_hilario_fn_desc:0 "The most understood and the most unjustly criticized Filipino is General Hilario Camino Moncado through hearsay, bigotry and prejudice. He is attacked in the newspapers unmercifully. He is crucified on the altar of jealousy. He has never answered back those unfounded attacks. He suffers in silence. Instead of hating the mudslingers, he tries to help them whenever he has the opportunity to do. He treats his verifiers and false accusers with kindness and love. He keeps on with his humanitarian work and service unperturbed. He has the will power and unyielding courage to overcome all obstacles that obstruct his path to success and glory. He is wise as an owl, and is gentle as a dove. He has a brave heart. He is like a mighty rock of pure granite. His work, humble as it seems, stands today like the impregnable Rock of Gibraltar, indestructible and unconquerable. To show the falsehoods of such perfidious propaganda, the only option is to create our own newspapers that reveal the truth of the doctrine of Man's Moral Concept."
PHI_hilario_anticom_desc:0 "Just what is communism and why do we, the free loving people of the world, abhor it? Some people say communism is a religion. Others believe that it is a doctrine of a political party. Still there are others who it is a doctrine of a political party. Still there are others who believe that communism is a form of government where everyone lives on an equal basis under one leader. Communism is a religion with Satan as their God. It is a political party of Satan who tries to persuade the people of this world to choose him instead of God. Communism is a form of government where all those who abide by it become human slaves, surrendering not only their material possession but their body and soul and become a tool or an instrument whereby to further Satan's evil purposes.\n\nJealousy and bolshevism are the blackest evils that grapple the inner structure of mankind since the day Cain was born into this world. Cain, the first sin of Adam and Eve, was a communist and the father of it. He was the first murderer and disbeliever. His evil works plagued every human soul alive today. His descendants all through the ages advocate murder, war, strikes, and all forms of troubles. To cover his evils he uses systematic lies carried by well organized net-work of liars. Today, in our modern civilization, one can easily identify them. They always attack by word and print those who favor God's mission here on this earth. Our Lord Jesus, the human mechanism of God Christ was the innocent victim of jealousy and bolshevism on the part of the attackers. General Moncado was also the innocent victim of jealousy and bolshevism. He was not crucified nor shot to death by the attackers. They appeared normal but inside they were hungry godless communists."
PHI_hilario_loyal_general_desc:0 "In the beginning, Jesus did not produce any students for he did not conduct classes nor opened a school. He had only disciples. Today, He has thousands of disciples and millions of followers all over the world. Moncado has created three different classes of followers. He has also millions of followers, thousands of disciples, and hundreds of students. These are visible and not only theoretical.\n\nToday, General Moncado stands bravely on the top of the world proclaiming the advent of a new era, Equal Man's acceptance of this new doctrine will make the curse of knowledge - "thou shalt surely die" ineffective for many centuries to come."
PHI_hilario_man_god_desc:0 "Morality is but Man's great divine power to achieve all things on earth - because it is life. Life is but humility and meekness of man's great virtue in order to inherit the wealth of the Earth. Man is God's human mechanism in His wisdom. Because without man on earth there is no God on earth. Man's moral is God's human Virtue. Moral is but man's divine guidance to achieve all earthly things - the material of life. The moral of a man is against all earthly vices. All vices are destructive to man's physical fitness - and, therefore, man should fight against all vices.\n\nBy nature and its divinity, and its creation, man's morality is God. God is moral. Moral is man, and man is God. Therefore let us achieve material success based upon Man's Moral Concept in life in order to be happy to live with man's neighbors.\n\nAll men should be strictly, literally, divinely follow the moral concept of man, and should fight against all forms of vices which are destructive to humanity, for it is the paramount duty of every man to serve humanity. Morality is but man's divine service for humanity. Humanity be serve is a moral virtue of every man to achieve in life. Life is but service and suffering for the love of humanity. Humanity is Gods creation. God's creation of the universe is but the divine pronouncement of peace on earth and Good-Will to all men."
PHI_hilario_fwca_desc:0 "It is inequitable that General Hilario Camino Moncado, one of the framers and signers of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, has been subjected to unfair criticisms. For he is respectable, kind, courteous, sincere, and loyal to God and Country, with unquenchable thirst foe JUSTICE, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND TRUTH. In every critical period of our leadership in wisdom and morality, shining brilliantly on the highest pinnacle of success and glory, despite persecution and untold suffering. It is not the victories on the field of battle -- on the land, on sea, and in the air where brute force meets barbarian savagery that are to be glorified and exhausted. The only victory that should be enshrined and adored is the ability to win and conquer the hearts of men of whatever race, color, or religion with love and sympathy."
PHI_hilario_golf_god_desc:0 "Truly, there is only one thought in a golfer's mind when he is making an approach shot. This thought is that ball must get into the green and stop as close or near to the hole as possible. When this desired thought would fail to materialize, an average golfer wonder why. The ordinary man feels the same way as the golfer does when his desired thought fails to give him the highest satisfaction in his struggle in the game of life.\n\nThe world we live in is something like the golf course. In the golf course the greens oras others prefer to call them "Islands" where the holes are located, are stationary objectives. When one makes the approach shot, these greens or islands do not move nor run away from you or from the ball. In fact, it is the misguided, the miscontrolled ball that runs away from the greens.\n\nGeneral Moncado loves golf. He is a good golfer and a good player. Learning to be a good man is like learning to be a good golfer. Interestingly, a good man and a good golfer strive for the same idea, that to be equal. One strives to be equal with God, and the other works for his part on every hole."
PHI_hilario_misson_billboard_desc:0 "Since Jesus was only able to teach the Way, the truth and the Life, all those who believe in Him were confronted with these evil questions - What Way shall we walk? What Truth shall be believed: What Life shall we live? - After Jesus was crucified, Satan took control of the churches founded by the apostles of Jesus. According to revelation, it is natural that Satan's Way was taught to be the right road to God, and the true Way was made wrong, In other words, through Satan's influence, whatever we think wrong, is actually right. Today, men always do the opposite. They want peace they prepare for war. The nation's talk of unity and construction but each nation's preparation indicated disunity and destruction. This is how Satan works with men. This is how Satan controls the minds of men. This is one reason why men cannot find peace and unity in this world."
PHI_hilario_cane_field_desc:0 "For the last half of a century we have watched the meteoric rise of a young leader who has started his life from a humble beginning, whose early boyhood was shrouded with mystery, a profound secret which was human comprehension. He has traveled all over the world seeking incessantly for the fountain-head of truth ,justice, wisdom, morality and love. Since General Moncado arrived in the continental United States, he was guided by the principle of Equifrilibricum. Because of this principle, he worked hard in order to develop a better relationship between Filipinos and Americans. The Filipino Federation of America was organized to serve as a vehicle to convince the American people as well his countrymen that they were brothers under the principles of Equifrilibricum. The Federation aimed to help early Filipino immigrants with their problems by outlining twelve objectives that would become the cornerstone of the organization. These objectives encompassed the Filipino community's bicultural existence in America, emphasizing mutual aid, moral standards, Christian values, and addressing issues related to Philippine-American relations, particularly the quest for Philippine independence."
PHI_hilario_calendar_desc:0 ""I believe that through her divine creation, woman shall rule the world and restore moral structure of humanity to make it acceptable to the Will of most Almighty God."\n\nGeneral Moncado sees that the Divinity of Woman is the only solution for eternal peace and unity among all men and nations on earth. Woman's divinity is pure because woman is made of purer matter than man and she cannot be influenced easily by Satan.\n\n Woman's superiority over man is demonstrated most effectively. Aristotle may say that of all animals, the males are stronger and wiser than the females. St. Paul writes that weak things have been chosen to confound the strong."
PHI_hilario_reincarnation_desc:0 "Jesus Christ in his second appearance will not make himself be recognized personally because, in Revelation we find these words: "I COME AS A THIEF." Also in Matthew these words are recorded, "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not even the angels of heaven but my Father." Now if we reason it carefully, when a thief wishes to rob a house, he has to disguise himself in a way to avoid detection of anyone.\n\nJesus Christ because of his Godship has foreseen that in the event he returns to this world there would not be only one Judas but millions of them ready to refuse and deny his GODSHIP and his doctrine that MAN AND GOD ARE EQUAL or I AND MY FATHER ARE ONE.\n\nThis is the very doctrine that caused the Jews to be angry with him "because he made himself equal with GOD." And now General Moncado is teaching the world that MAN AND GOD ARE EQUAL through the Man's Moral Concept. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS THE JEWS DID TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO? We hope with all sincerity that this thing must not happen again. Once is enough. All E.F.B Students in the world today are praying that the world must not make the same mistake twice. Please do not just read your Bible but learn them. Read carefully the following words which are recorded in Matthew 24:6-8 and Luke 21:25-26. Many of these things have already come to pass. Others are about to come. Because these are the words of the Master. Everyone of them will surely come. These prophetic words are indicated below:\n\n"AND YOU SHALL HEAR OF WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS: SEE THAT YE BE NOT TROUBLED FOR ALL THESE THINGS MUST COME TO PASS, BUT THE END IS NOT YET. FOR NATION SHALL RISE AGAINST NATION, AND KINGDOM AGAINST KINGDOM, AND THERE SHALL BE FAMINES, AND PESTILENCES, AND EARTHQUAKES IN DIVERSE PLACES. ALL THESE THINGS ARE THE BEGINNING OF SORROWS."\n\n"AND THERE SHALL BE SIGNS IN THE SUN AND IN THE MOON, AND IN THE STARS: UPON THE EARTH DISTRESS OF NATIONS WITH PERPLEXITY: THE SEA AND THE WAVES ROARING. MEN'S HEART FAILING THEM FOR FEAR, AND FOR THE POWERS OF HEAVEN SHALL BE SHAKEN."\n\nThese are the signs that he is at the door ready to enter this world. But he is no longer at the door. He has entered, and he is one among you now. The trouble is that you don't know how to find him among the large crowd of humanity. It is just like looking for a needle in the haystack. But there is only one way to do it and that is to be a moral being. In order to do that we have to study, observe and "should strictly, literally, divinely follow the moral concept of man." Only a moral being is able to penetrate into the elements of this disguise.\n\n"I COME AS A THIEF". If it is so, then no wonder that only a few have found and believe Him today in His present form. Yes, He is not white anymore, but brown; a Filipino and not a jew by race. This is God's doing, and it is wonderful."
PHI_hilario_six_stars_desc:0 "Equifrilibricum is the name of the New City of Jerusalem where the Divine Master Equi Frili Brium reigns. It also refers to the people who resides in it. This name was introduced by General Hilario Camino Moncado in His book through the Spiritual Director Lorenzo de los Reyes. He taught this subject in the College of Mystery Calcutta, India which gave Him the title of Supreme Psychic and Mystic Master. Equifrilibricum is the foundation of a true democracy in the world. A true democracy is a form of government of the people by the people, and for the people." #need more
