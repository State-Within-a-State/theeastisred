PHI_hilario_fn_desc:0 "The most understood and the most unjustly criticized Filipino is General Hilario Camino Moncado through hearsay, bigotry and prejudice. He is attacked in the newspapers unmercifully. He is crucified on the altar of jealousy. He has never answered back those unfounded attacks. He suffers in silence. Instead of hating the mudslingers, he tries to help them whenever he has the opportunity to do. He treats his verifiers and false accusers with kindness and love. He keeps on with his humanitarian work and service unperturbed. He has the will power and unyielding courage to overcome all obstacles that obstruct his path to success and glory. He is wise as an owl, and is gentle as a dove. He has a brave heart. He is like a mighty rock of pure granite. His work, humble as it seems, stands today like the impregnable Rock of Gibraltar, indestructible and unconquerable. To show the falsehoods of such perfidious propaganda, the only option is to create our own newspapers that reveal the truth of the doctrine of Man's Moral Concept."
PHI_hilario_anticom_desc:0 "Just what is communism and why do we, the free loving people of the world, abhor it? Some people say communism is a religion. Others believe that it is a doctrine of a political party. Still there are others who it is a doctrine of a political party. Still there are others who believe that communism is a form of government where everyone lives on an equal basis under one leader. Communism is a religion with Satan as their God. It is a political party of Satan who tries to persuade the people of this world to choose him instead of God. Communism is a form of government where all those who abide by it become human slaves, surrendering not only their material possession but their body and soul and become a tool or an instrument whereby to further Satan's evil purposes.\n\nJealousy and bolshevism are the blackest evils that grapple the inner structure of mankind since the day Cain was born into this world. Cain, the first sin of Adam and Eve, was a communist and the father of it. He was the first murderer and disbeliever. His evil works plagued every human soul alive today. His descendants all through the ages advocate murder, war, strikes, and all forms of troubles. To cover his evils he uses systematic lies carried by well organized net-work of liars. Today, in our modern civilization, one can easily identify them. They always attack by word and print those who favor God's mission here on this earth. Our Lord Jesus, the human mechanism of God Christ was the innocent victim of jealousy and bolshevism on the part of the attackers. General Moncado was also the innocent victim of jealousy and bolshevism. He was not crucified nor shot to death by the attackers. They appeared normal but inside they were hungry godless communists."
PHI_hilario_loyal_general_desc:0 "In the beginning, Jesus did not produce any students for he did not conduct classes nor opened a school. He had only disciples. Today, He has thousands of disciples and millions of followers all over the world. Moncado has created three different classes of followers. He has also millions of followers, thousands of disciples, and hundreds of students. These are visible and not only theoretical.\n\nToday, General Moncado stands bravely on the top of the world proclaiming the advent of a new era, Equal Man's acceptance of this new doctrine will make the curse of knowledge - "thou shalt surely die" ineffective for many centuries to come."
PHI_hilario_man_god_desc:0 "Morality is but Man's great divine power to achieve all things on earth - because it is life. Life is but humility and meekness of man's great virtue in order to inherit the wealth of the Earth. Man is God's human mechanism in His wisdom. Because without man on earth there is no God on earth. Man's moral is God's human Virtue. Moral is but man's divine guidance to achieve all earthly things - the material of life. The moral of a man is against all earthly vices. All vices are destructive to man's physical fitness - and, therefore, man should fight against all vices.\n\nBy nature and its divinity, and its creation, man's morality is God. God is moral. Moral is man, and man is God. Therefore let us achieve material success based upon Man's Moral Concept in life in order to be happy to live with man's neighbors.\n\nAll men should be strictly, literally, divinely follow the moral concept of man, and should fight against all forms of vices which are destructive to humanity, for it is the paramount duty of every man to serve humanity. Morality is but man's divine service for humanity. Humanity be serve is a moral virtue of every man to achieve in life. Life is but service and suffering for the love of humanity. Humanity is Gods creation. God's creation of the universe is but the divine pronouncement of peace on earth and Good-Will to all men."
PHI_hilario_fwca_desc:0 "It is inequitable that General Hilario Camino Moncado, one of the framers and signers of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, has been subjected to unfair criticisms. For he is respectable, kind, courteous, sincere, and loyal to God and Country, with unquenchable thirst foe JUSTICE, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND TRUTH. In every critical period of our leadership in wisdom and morality, shining brilliantly on the highest pinnacle of success and glory, despite persecution and untold suffering. It is not the victories on the field of battle -- on the land, on sea, and in the air where brute force meets barbarian savagery that are to be glorified and exhausted. The only victory that should be enshrined and adored is the ability to win and conquer the hearts of men of whatever race, color, or religion with love and sympathy."
PHI_hilario_golf_god_desc:0 "Truly, there is only one thought in a golfer's mind when he is making an approach shot. This thought is that ball must get into the green and stop as close or near to the hole as possible. When this desired thought would fail to materialize, an average golfer wonder why. The ordinary man feels the same way as the golfer does when his desired thought fails to give him the highest satisfaction in his struggle in the game of life.\n\nThe world we live in is something like the golf course. In the golf course the greens or as others prefer to call them "Islands" where the holes are located, are stationary objectives. When one makes the approach shot, these greens or islands do not move nor run away from you or from the ball. In fact, it is the misguided, the miscontrolled ball that runs away from the greens.\n\nGeneral Moncado loves golf. He is a good golfer and a good player. Learning to be a good man is like learning to be a good golfer. Interestingly, a good man and a good golfer strive for the same idea, that to be equal. One strives to be equal with God, and the other works for his part on every hole."
PHI_hilario_misson_billboard_desc:0 "Since Jesus was only able to teach the Way, the truth and the Life, all those who believe in Him were confronted with these evil questions - What Way shall we walk? What Truth shall be believed: What Life shall we live? - After Jesus was crucified, Satan took control of the churches founded by the apostles of Jesus. According to revelation, it is natural that Satan's Way was taught to be the right road to God, and the true Way was made wrong, In other words, through Satan's influence, whatever we think wrong, is actually right. Today, men always do the opposite. They want peace they prepare for war. The nation's talk of unity and construction but each nation's preparation indicated disunity and destruction. This is how Satan works with men. This is how Satan controls the minds of men. This is one reason why men cannot find peace and unity in this world."
PHI_hilario_cane_field_desc:0 "For the last half of a century we have watched the meteoric rise of a young leader who has started his life from a humble beginning, whose early boyhood was shrouded with mystery, a profound secret which was human comprehension. He has traveled all over the world seeking incessantly for the fountain-head of truth ,justice, wisdom, morality and love. Since General Moncado arrived in the continental United States, he was guided by the principle of Equifrilibricum. Because of this principle, he worked hard in order to develop a better relationship between Filipinos and Americans. The Filipino Federation of America was organized to serve as a vehicle to convince the American people as well his countrymen that they were brothers under the principles of Equifrilibricum. The Federation aimed to help early Filipino immigrants with their problems by outlining twelve objectives that would become the cornerstone of the organization. These objectives encompassed the Filipino community's bicultural existence in America, emphasizing mutual aid, moral standards, Christian values, and addressing issues related to Philippine-American relations, particularly the quest for Philippine independence."
PHI_hilario_calendar_desc:0 ""I believe that through her divine creation, woman shall rule the world and restore moral structure of humanity to make it acceptable to the Will of most Almighty God."\n\nGeneral Moncado sees that the Divinity of Woman is the only solution for eternal peace and unity among all men and nations on earth. Woman's divinity is pure because woman is made of purer matter than man and she cannot be influenced easily by Satan.\n\n Woman's superiority over man is demonstrated most effectively. Aristotle may say that of all animals, the males are stronger and wiser than the females. St. Paul writes that weak things have been chosen to confound the strong."
PHI_hilario_reincarnation_desc:0 "Jesus Christ in his second appearance will not make himself be recognized personally because, in Revelation we find these words: "I COME AS A THIEF." Also in Matthew these words are recorded, "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not even the angels of heaven but my Father." Now if we reason it carefully, when a thief wishes to rob a house, he has to disguise himself in a way to avoid detection of anyone.\n\nJesus Christ because of his Godship has foreseen that in the event he returns to this world there would not be only one Judas but millions of them ready to refuse and deny his GODSHIP and his doctrine that MAN AND GOD ARE EQUAL or I AND MY FATHER ARE ONE.\n\nThis is the very doctrine that caused the Jews to be angry with him "because he made himself equal with GOD." And now General Moncado is teaching the world that MAN AND GOD ARE EQUAL through the Man's Moral Concept. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS THE JEWS DID TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO? We hope with all sincerity that this thing must not happen again. Once is enough. All E.F.B Students in the world today are praying that the world must not make the same mistake twice. Please do not just read your Bible but learn them. Read carefully the following words which are recorded in Matthew 24:6-8 and Luke 21:25-26. Many of these things have already come to pass. Others are about to come. Because these are the words of the Master. Everyone of them will surely come. These prophetic words are indicated below:\n\n"AND YOU SHALL HEAR OF WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS: SEE THAT YE BE NOT TROUBLED FOR ALL THESE THINGS MUST COME TO PASS, BUT THE END IS NOT YET. FOR NATION SHALL RISE AGAINST NATION, AND KINGDOM AGAINST KINGDOM, AND THERE SHALL BE FAMINES, AND PESTILENCES, AND EARTHQUAKES IN DIVERSE PLACES. ALL THESE THINGS ARE THE BEGINNING OF SORROWS."\n\n"AND THERE SHALL BE SIGNS IN THE SUN AND IN THE MOON, AND IN THE STARS: UPON THE EARTH DISTRESS OF NATIONS WITH PERPLEXITY: THE SEA AND THE WAVES ROARING. MEN'S HEART FAILING THEM FOR FEAR, AND FOR THE POWERS OF HEAVEN SHALL BE SHAKEN."\n\nThese are the signs that he is at the door ready to enter this world. But he is no longer at the door. He has entered, and he is one among you now. The trouble is that you don't know how to find him among the large crowd of humanity. It is just like looking for a needle in the haystack. But there is only one way to do it and that is to be a moral being. In order to do that we have to study, observe and "should strictly, literally, divinely follow the moral concept of man." Only a moral being is able to penetrate into the elements of this disguise.\n\n"I COME AS A THIEF". If it is so, then no wonder that only a few have found and believe Him today in His present form. Yes, He is not white anymore, but brown; a Filipino and not a jew by race. This is God's doing, and it is wonderful."
PHI_hilario_six_stars_desc:0 "Equifrilibricum is the name of the New City of Jerusalem where the Divine Master Equi Frili Brium reigns. It also refers to the people who resides in it. This name was introduced by General Hilario Camino Moncado in His book through the Spiritual Director Lorenzo de los Reyes. He taught this subject in the College of Mystery Calcutta, India which gave Him the title of Supreme Psychic and Mystic Master. Equifrilibricum is the foundation of a true democracy in the world. A true democracy is a form of government of the people by the people, and for the people." #need more

PHI_democrata_desc:0 "The desire to prove that the Philippines was worthy of being a state on the world stage, with democratic representation, was what had given the opposition the drive to fight. Despite the hard road in front of it, victory was grasped, showing the world that politics in the Philippines was not one of personal connections but one of ideas. The victorious differentiating ideas of the Popular Front are now on their way to being implemented after winning the people's mandate."
PHI_democrata_social_justice_desc:0 "The danger of the idea of Quezon's idea of social justice was plain to see. It was a populist argument of rich versus poor, that the wealthy weren't doing their rightful part, that it was their fault the poor were poor because what was owed to the majority wasn't given by the minority. The problem of poverty is not the fault of any individual or grouping that seeks to ruin others, rather it is the fault of our current society and all of us living in it. Injustice can only be resolved by coming to terms with the reality of the situation without seeking a easy scapegoat to blame. Together, a society to be proud of will be built."
PHI_democrata_against_radicalism_desc:0 "Radicalism is a very easy tool for those who wish for personal gain. Simply act large with all the answers in easily rememberable catchphrases decrying the enemy supposedly holding the country back, and your desired voter will come running towards you. Such is not the foundation of a proper democracy. Without the need for radicalism to excite, the simple truth of necessity will come out."
PHI_democrata_welfare_org_desc:0 "The very poor never have any money, and they must always go into debt to finance economic production. Even if land was appropriated to them, they will eventually lose it, because they must borrow money to buy materials; they must mortgage their lands, and eventually they lose those lands. Intervention in the form of agricultural banks and other methods of regulated financing, to help bring small properties into financial success without aiming to harm another, will grant stability for our society as well as prosperity."
PHI_democrata_labor_commission_desc:0 "Support The National Labor Relations Commission"
PHI_democrata_subdue_monopolies_desc:0 "The problems of free trade are devastating for the national idea of an independent Philippines, and the longer it stays as policy, the longer its negative effects accumulate. Despite Quezon's louder and more radical shouts of nationalism, his previous actions shows the reality. To achieve a free Philippines, the first step is to dig us out of the economic bondage of reliance on American trade, which can only be done by protecting our own industries while relying less on the open markets of America."

PHI_democrata_belo_act_desc:0 "Striking Down the Belo Act"
PHI_democrata_protectionist_policies_desc:0 "To build up our economics at home, provincial and municipal governments should be given more autonomy. This will be possible by making them financially independent of the central government through granting them greater powers of taxation. In this way, local governments will have more initiative to take advantage of opportunities and solve local problems. As the positive effects of our development continue piling on top of each other, our economics will truly be strengthened and independent."
PHI_democrata_sotto_law_desc:0 "The Press Freedom Law is a law, authored by our very own Vicente Sotto, protecting journalists from being compelled to name confidential news sources. This law marks a continuance of the rule of law that we have sought to fight for as it allows for a stronger independent media. Now, reporting on matters that may be harmful to the government will be allowed as their sources can remain confidential without fear of reprisal."
PHI_democrata_hare_haws_desc:0 "In the fight against radicalism and demagoguery, attacking the unscrupulous politician is merely an attack at a symptom that manifests from a larger problem. The true cause lies once more not from an enemy, but the simple reality of lacking education. Our policies were correct and won because they managed to resonate with the students in the towns and barrios. They were intelligent enough to understand our platform, and to explain it to the voters of their towns. Once education reaches throughout the country, no more can a politician evade the question of their policies with simple alluring words and will need to properly explain the merit of their platform to convince the voters."
PHI_democrata_great_man_desc:0 "Looking back, the success of our policies has shown that our method of honest philosophy over unscrupulous demagoguery has been well rewarded by the populace at large. The radicals of the socialists will be left in the footnotes of history as the class war that they sought to incite failed to take hold in the minds of the voters. Even the fighter Quezon left to be opposition could not rally many to fight the artificial vote-getting enemies in our administration. Indeed, the dream of creating an ideal state has very well succeeded, with the tired man preparing to rest."

PHI_lincoln_desc:0 "Who is Abraham Lincoln? A great man, the emancipator of slaves, the savior of the United States, one of few universally beloved American presidents, and so much more... Who was Abraham Lincoln before all that though? A simple man, from a humble log cabin background, an Average Joe, a John Smith (or, in the Philippines, a Juan de la Cruz), who had history turned out differently, may have remained so. So who, in the modern day, is more like the Great Emancipator then the Philippines very own Pascual Racuyal? Unlike Abraham Lincoln, he has cultivated an identity of being a political gadfly of questionable respect and societal purchase, but like him, due to a political crisis, he has been thrust into a position of great power very suddenly. His accession to the heights of power following Quezon's death was meant to be nothing; a joke, a humorous diversion before the bickering careerists could convince the nation of their "serious" candidacy. After all, who in society would give a madman with mad ideas like Racuyal the time of day? Then again, in the 19th Century, one would be considered a madman for advocating abolitionism, or even the equality of all peoples. So Pascual Racuyal, lending his ear to the people as Honest Abe would have done, will set out to show the careerists, and the world, that he is the man of the hour, and that he will lead the nation to its rightful place in the world."
PHI_lincoln_naturotheropy_desc:0 "President Racuyal's government, like that of Quezon's, remains harangued by radicals of all stripes, namely the remnant Sakdalistas, agrarian peasant revolutionists, and the various cults running about the hinterlands. His solution, as outlined in his campaign pamphlets, remains one of his most puzzling policy ideas: naturo-therapy. Married to the idea of a peaceful solution to Philippine conflicts, President Racuyal intends to set up a network of rehabilitation centers for radicals of all stripes who promise to lay down their arms, focusing on new psychotherapy methods, and a focus on diet and substance control in order to blunt the influence of violent ideas. While this proposal seems questionable at best, it has also promised that such centers will be used as general clinics as well by other members of Pascual's government, seemingly already enticing a number of militants to their premises."
PHI_lincoln_new_roads_desc:0 "Plastic, as in the synthetic bakelite form of plastic, not natural plastics such as shellac, has not existed in the world for a long amount of time - only first being synthesized in 1907, and even now being predominantly a substance locked behind the domain of major world powers and their corporate tentacles. Moreover, it is still not entirely useful as a practical material, and it seems it will be years until the substance can replace glass or metals as a proper construction tool. None of this has deterred Pascual Racuyal, whose ambitious campaign promises specifically outline the development and construction of modular plastic roads to alleviate road wearing and damage issues. While absurd on the outset, according to new research emerging from Britain and Germany, it may well be possible - if not anytime soon. In the meantime, President Racuyal is willing to supplement these ambitious dreams with more realistic focuses on repairing extant roads, until the plastic future is realized of course."
PHI_lincoln_air_conditioning_desc:0 "For some time now, President Racuyal has promised to cool Manila, an infamously constantly hot and muggy city. Just how does he propose to do this? Simple; a series of giant climate controlled domes. Now, seeing that suggestion, one might be tempted to question the feasibility of such a project on a number of levels, from the money needed for such an endeavor, to the very likelihood of it being physically impossible. Like with most other things, the president is at once frighteningly evasive and steadfastly optimistic, especially having looked into the geodesic dome of Walther Bauersfield of Germany. Even he admits it will take some time, however, and until then, his government is settling for a state-funded implementation of air conditioning units across Manila, and soon other cities. Even without the astronomically high cost of the dome project, this project will be of significant expense and difficulty - but the benefits of expanded access to climate control in one of the most humid countries in the world will be astronomical, and the people are already hailing the prowess of the program."
PHI_lincoln_dykes_desc:0 "The Philippines, particularly Luzon, is a country harangued by many a type of natural disaster, but no other is as insidiously deadly as the constant floods on the island. Going far beyond most rhetoric, President Racuyal has not only called for the flooding to be confronted, but to be wholly abolished. Surprisingly, considering the president's other proposals and programs, this is far more feasible, though it, of course, comes with its own problems, including the expense, the sheer scale of the project, and conflicts with the many landowners, peasants, and even indigenous groups whose land lies within the bounds of the project. Nonetheless, this program has garnered a significant amount of support, even within the opposition to President Racuyal's government. Indeed, if flooding can be controlled in Luzon, it would prove a great economic boon for the future."
PHI_lincoln_bridges_desc:0 "Infamously, the president once spoke at a Manila barrio gathering, confounding the audience by responding to a question about the need for a bridge, or lack thereof, by suggesting to build a river, and then build the bridge. The idea of a "riverless bridge", however, is not quite as ludicrous as it seems. Some civil engineers, after some time and thought, believe they have realized his idea in the novel idea of the elevated highway, a technique pioneered in New York City in 1929 to reduce traffic burdens in the city. This solution could revolutionize travel within the greater Manila area, and may well be a viable solution in other cities. Despite the expense, it is a project that civil engineers are undertaking with much enthusiasm, and it has led many to consider whether the president is truly mad, or a misunderstood visionary."
PHI_lincoln_friar_lands_desc:0 "It's no secret that there's a lot wrong with food production, and farming as a whole, in the Philippines. Among the president's many vast promises, one that has the attention of many, for better or worse reasons, is the promise of transforming agriculture and food within the Philippines by using the world's most advanced agrarian techniques to create a series of super-farms. In another measure that promises to be expensive, time consuming, and questionably feasible (in its totality at least), the president has found ample opposition. Yet, there are more than ever, even within elements of the government generally hostile to Pascual, who are willing to entertain not only Pascual's sweeping proclamations, but the program itself. If even a fraction of the proposed changes are implemented, not only would food production increase, but the government would take direct control of much of the land controlled by Hacienda landowners, disbanding the archaic institutions and improving the public welfare in one fell swoop. Said landowners have already decried such measures as unconstitutional and criminal, but popular momentum may overwhelm them as the Filipino countryside marches into a new century of farming."
PHI_lincoln_fireproof_currency_desc:0 "The sad fact of the matter is that plastic is not immune to fire; given enough contact with fire, it will melt. This has not dissuaded President Racuyal from his belief that reformatting the Philippines' dollar from paper to plastic bills would increase the fire resistance of the bills - as well as, supposedly, make the system fraud proof and counterfeit proof. This measure has caused an uproar, with the president's opposition claiming that these are merely the ramblings of a madman rather than a competent politician. On the other hand, the president has got people talking, not just about plastics, but the future in general, and imports of oil and chemicals are through the roof, along with various official and unofficial research projects into plastic. Some economists and planners looking to America for inspiration have even noted that plastic, once refined and rendered more available, could prove to be a useful substance in terms of credit accounting charge cards. No matter where the proposal goes, the president has increasingly captured the minds and wonder of the people."
PHI_lincoln_against_rackets_desc:0 "If nothing else, President Racuyal is a man of action - and nowhere is his energy more apparent than in his proposed method to curtail rackets and organized crime: helicopters. The helicopter is a new technology, but has proven its efficacy in various parts of the world - and Pascual Racuyal believes they can be used in a civilian context as much as a military one. To the end of stopping crime, President Racuyal has signed into being a special helicopter task force whose sole purpose is to act on movements of organized crime and conduct lightning raids on any such activity. Aside from the police element of the task force, the new institution will also energetically pursue the procurement of helicopter designs, and the increased research and optimization of such. Because of the stunned and disorganized opposition, nobody has been able to persuade him from not joining such missions personally as well."
PHI_lincoln_anti_corruption_desc:0 "The president, having come from a background of poverty, is not a man who needs great wealth. It is thus that he accepts only 100 pesos as salary as president - a feat made rather impressive considering his constant movement and reluctance to inhabit the Malacañang Palace. This is the basis, he believes, for any Filipino president going forward, as wealth breeds greed and laziness. This mentality has led to his new harsh stance on corruption: a hundred year prison sentence for anyone proven guilty of the crime. Although criticized as a truly ludicrous punishment, and of questionable efficacy given the oversaturation of corruption amongst landowner-dominant local politics, such a harsh punishment for those caught may well be enough to motivate malefactors to reform..."
PHI_lincoln_local_inspections_desc:0 "As the country adjusts to President Racuyal's eccentric style of governance, the formerly abnormal has increasingly become the new normal, or is at least spoken about in polite company, and not simply dismissed as a joke. The president's new program of "secret visits" pushes even this envelope though. Envisioned as a method of rooting out local inefficiency and corruption, the president himself plans, and already has conducted, unannounced visits (in disguise, no less) to local government institutions on a regular basis. Although decried as a violation of privacy and a plan of questionable efficacy, the announcement has nonetheless put a magnifying glass on local issues, and corrupt or lazy administrators are feeling the popular pressure."
PHI_lincoln_thousand_questions_desc:0 "Before the president's surprise ascent to the height of political power, he was known for his presence as a political gadfly - one of his favorite tactics being to challenge his much more prominent opponents, such as Gregorio Agliapay and Manuel Quezon, to long debates with a barrage of questions and challenges. Despite the lack of efficacy on his part (his supposed interlocutors never actually took him up on these debates), his first forays into this tactic were before he attained the office of the presidency - now that he's the president, his opponents cannot dodge his verbal dissections any longer. President Racuyal intends to make such rigorous questioning and detailed planning the norm, as career politicians must be made to eschew vaguery and dishonesty by being not only ready to answer a number of specific questions about their policies, but plotting their programs in a manner similar to that of the president. This method promises to separate the political wheat from the chaff, and only the truly hardy and selfless will rise from the legions of corrupt and self-serving politicians."
PHI_lincoln_average_president_desc:0 "Pascual Racuyal's story is the quintessential underdog story. He started from the bottom, disrespected and dismissed by "polite" society at large, and now he's here: the presidential palace, the levers of power, the towering heights of command in Filipino society. If Pascual Racuyal was a more self-interested man, he'd surely crown himself a king and lie back to enjoy the spoils of graft and corruption like any normal politician, but he is no normal politician - he was and will always be a member of the common hoi polloi. In the future, he intends to give up his position - but ideally, not to another career politician, but to someone else like him: an average Joe, a Juan de la Cruz. As President Racuyal has proven, the most unorthodox ideas can be the most successful, and someone who was once just a face in the crowd can become president of the whole country. After all, above all else, through the corruption and troubles, Pascual Racuyal believes in the power of the people, and such power will last the Philippines long into the future."

PHI_antisoc_social_justice_stability_desc:0 "Quezon's policy of social justice was clearly lacking for the radicals to be elected despite all the advantages held by the ruling party. The problem of mass poverty led to the hopelessness of entire communities, allowing the blandishments of syndicalism to capture their hearts, despite its lack of appreciation for human dignity and rights. Perhaps the impoverished many saw the economic backers of the previous government or the self-serving attitude of government elites. Fortunately, the Philippines has, through luck, been given a second chance from such a system. We cannot let such a chance go to waste. Let us build a new government with a new social justice program, one that will promote the welfare and economic stability of all people through governmental action to bring the greatest good to the greatest number. Only when the majority, including both the property owner and the workingman, can feel economically secure can we say that representative government will survive this age."
PHI_antisoc_pink_liberalism_desc:0 "Moderation is a necessity lest radical beliefs of change without reason sweep away the existing society. Indeed, as a judge himself, Laurel has seen the conservatism of courts first hand. Such conservatism seeks to keep our hard-fought stability by keeping with the status quo. As Virgil once wrote, "Keep close to the shore: let others venture on the deep." Such sentiments may be admirable, but they are not enough on their own. After all, by keeping close to the shore, it does not mean that we shall never venture on the deep. A single-minded conservatism can hinder necessary progress and promote stagnation. It is much better to keep in mind the necessity of both conservation and change, adjusting as needed. It is a fact that governance must change and evolve, just like life itself. Let us weave a path between the red hot radicalism and the white reliable conservatism for a pink liberalism of growth and evolution."
PHI_antisoc_two_party_desc:0 "Yet another problem of the past was the lens through which politics was viewed. For each politician, the purpose was to enrich themselves and their loyal followers through patronage. When a grouping of these politicians made an alliance, this became a political party working to advance only its own interests while weakening rival factions. The majority party thus ruled the country for their own benefit instead of for the benefit of the nation. Meanwhile, the opposition was just as bad, as it was made up of the same type of politician, merely unlucky enough to end up in the minority. Either scheming to overtake the majority through character assignation or maneuvering to be admitted into the majority camp, they too ignored governance and fixing the problems facing the country. We shall seek to fix this sad state of affairs for a true two-party system where the ruling party and the opposition engage with each other constructively to come up with the proper solutions to issues. Such can happen only through creating balance between the two sides through preventing the self-enrichment of future ruling politicians. Regulations on how ministers are appointed, external funding, and political interference against the opposition will limit the selfishness of both the majority and the opposition. Thus creating a stable democratic system that will properly conduct public affairs."

PHI_antisoc_laissez_socialism_desc:0 "Representative democracy has been intimately linked to capitalism and the idea of laissez-faire. This has resulted in a number of serious problems in the country: "inefficient social organizations, the poverty and consequent degradation of the poor, the selfishness of many citizens who seldom think of the group interest, and particularly...such matters as wasteful production of techniques, very limited utilization of our natural resources, a backward educational system and curriculum, a weakness for self indulgence, corruption, and a general let-the-devil-take-the-hindmost attitude." Such issues can only be truly fixed by abandoning the principle of laissez-faire for a governent that vitalizes republicanism with state socialism. It is clear the population is in favor of social and economic planning so that great masses of the people may have ample opportunity for work, may live a civilized man's life, have homes, medical attention, modern education, and earn the amenities of life to the extent of social and economic security against old age and the unforeseem hazards of life. To that end, let us create the National Economic Development Authority to find solutions to our Philippine problems. It will undertake centralized direction and control of economic and social activities in order to enhance the existing success of the principles of social justice for all groups in our hard pressed society."

PHI_com_right_unions_desc:0 "The revolution of 1896 has had its legacy claimed by many of political forces by now, including groups that would oppose us. Yet, such claims are based solely on the national liberation aspect of the revolution while ignoring the actual character and basis of said revolution. Once that analysis is factored in, the agrarian basis of the revolution is clear to see. In response to the oppressive feudal order, the working peoples of the fields and the towns took up arms against the dominant religious landlord class. The abuses of the friars were known to the leaders of the revolution, with the revolution not recognizing the previous usurpation of the property of the Filipino people by the Spanish government and religious corporations. The proletarian leader Andrés Bonifacio also wrote in the "The Last Appeal of the Philippines":\nAng lupa at buhay na tinatahanan\nbukid at tubigang kalawak-lawakan\nat gayon din pati ng mga halamanan\nsa paring Kastila ay binubuwisan.\nYet, the Americans showed up desiring economic and political domination of the Philippines. Their allies were the very same rulers of the feudal order, stopping the goals of the revolution. Now with the working classes empowered, it is time to fulfill these revolutionary aspirations."
PHI_com_root_mass_desc:0 "In the struggle of the 1896 revolution, the Filipino people had desired to take control over the haciendas. Let us now achieve this takeover of these means of production and replace the previous private and foreign ownership with collective ownership. This unfinished goal will now act as the first step towards the final goal of common ownership of all the means of production. Indeed, the power in the countryside has now shifted hands."
PHI_com_country_side_desc:0 "In the final analysis, the Philippines is dominated by the wretched feudal order. The urban proletariat lacks the numbers to lead the country forwards on its own. Similar circumstances in Russia, were what paved the way for a worker-peasant alliance. Yet the proletarian-led alliance was defeated, stifled in its birth. Now with our victory, it is time to reconstitute such an alliance, while learning from the failures of the past. All evidence points to the necessity of focusing more efforts on the peasants. They make up the masses of the country, while the proletariat has not fully grown in our country. Indeed, the nature of the peasant demands to end the feudal order are directly against the current state of things in a way that the proletarian demands for better conditions are not. As Rizal once said, "And for him the struggle means death to one or the other combatant." So let us take up the mantle of the agrarian revolution, and use the revolutionary consciousness that has developed within the peasantry."
