TTR_Khan_In_Kazan:0 "The Khan in Kazan"
TTR_Khan_In_Kazan_desc:0 "The new Khan Shafi has entered the Kazan Kremlin and secured his position as the new Khan.

TTR_Reassure_Nobility:0 "Reassure the Nobility"
TTR_Reassure_Nobility_desc:0 "To solidify our powerbase and ensure the stability of our regime, we will need the support of the local nobility. The local Tatar noble class that has long dominated local politics shall be given far-reaching privileges and rights over their fellow man, if and only if they serve the new Khan."

TTR_All_Tatar_Kurultai:0 "An All-Tatar Kurultai"
TTR_All_Tatar_Kurultai_desc:0 "Our ancestors, the mighty and fearsome Mongols, and their descendants all relied on the organization structure of the Kurultai, or councils of khans and chiefs, to rule and administer their vast empires. This model of governance served our kin well, and so it shall serve us! A new council shall be formed, the All-Tatar Kurultai, and it will serve as the new legislative body of our khanate. However, to ensure that it is loyal to our whims and the true needs of the people, it shall still be completely under control of Khan."

TTR_Form_Darugas:0 "Revive the Darughas"
TTR_Form_Darugas_desc:0 "Darughas were the archaic territorial subdivisions of the old Mongol Empire and its children states such as our ancestors in the medieval-era Kazan Khanate. Each of these regions was lorded over by a certain hereditary feudal chief or khan as its master. We shall revive and modernize this system to fit our needs, subdividing our new khanate under loyal nobles, generals, holymen, and other prominent figures in the Kurultai. This sort of neo-feudalism shall become the new foundation for our state’s administrative apparatus, returning us to tradition as we strive towards our new future."

TTR_Purge_Unfaithful:0 "Purge the Unfaithful"
TTR_Purge_Unfaithful_desc:0 "Jews, Christians, Secularist, and other vile heretics and infidels plot against our state at every turn.

TTR_Khan_Guards:0 "The New Kheshig"
TTR_Khan_Guards_desc:0 "In order to safeguard our most prominent national figures as well as to serve as the vanguard of our armed forces, the Mongolic guard of old - the Kheshig - shall be revived and modernized to fit the needs of our state.

TTR_Islamic_Order:0 "Islamic Order"
TTR_Islamic_Order_desc:0 "There is but one true faith on this Earth, and its prophet is Mohammed! The influence of Islam in Tataria must be made to reign supreme over these lands, and so the state has enacted a plan to fully Islamicize Tataria, cleansing it of the influence of the Secularism and Orthodoxy. New mosques and temples shall be built across the nation, with many serving as either schools for our youth or as shelters and clinics for the poor and downtrodden. Imams will be given sweeping powers and authority over much of the state’s lower functions, and more men of the clergy shall be allowed into the Kurultai. Tataria shall be a land truly blessed by Allah’s touch."

TTR_Army_Of_Nomads:0 "An Army of Nomads"
TTR_Army_Of_Nomads_desc:0 "We are the heirs to the Mongols and the Golden Horde. Our ancestors were great nomads who swiftly rode across Eurasia on their thundering steeds and created some of the largest empires in history. We must hold true to this identity and incorporate their strategies into our army tactics, with modernization of course. Our armed forces shall be flexible and able to strike like lightning anywhere within our domain, for we are the sons of Batu and Ghengis, and we shall not sully their names."

TTR_Zilant_Awakens:0 "Zilant Awakens"
TTR_Zilant_Awakens_desc:0 "Zilant, or Ajdaha, is the legendary serpent-like dragon which is said to have lived centuries ago in Kazan, with many old shamans and mystics of Idel-Ural still believed that any snake that lives past a century shall turn into such a majestic beast. Described as a serpentine, dragon or wyvern-like beast with the body shape of a massive bird of prey, the legs of a rooster, the tail of snake, and the ears of a wolf, with crimson wings and dagger-like teeth, and adorned with dark grey and black scales and feathers, this beast of legend has long been a ferocious symbol of our nation, being depicted on the Khanate flag and displayed in most public settings as a symbol of Tataria and our strength. Like this long-slumbering beast, our khanate is a sleeping giant, ready to burst forth and slay the vermin that have assailed the lands of our birthright."

TTR_Expand_Into_Muscovy:0 "Revenge Against the Old Duchy of Muscovy"
TTR_Expand_Into_Muscovy_desc:0 "With the foundations of our new regime cemented and the rule of Khan Shafi solidified, it is now time to take the fight from the enemies within our border to the parasitic foes that leech over our rightful lands. The lands around Moscow are ours by birthright, and we shall tear these fertile heartlands from the putrid Sons of Rus, for the the era of Russian domination is at an end - the era of Tataria has just begun."

TTR_Our_Rightful_Claims:0 "Altin Urda Shall Rise Again!"
TTR_Our_Rightful_Claims_desc:0 "We are the one, true heirs to Batu Khan, unifier of the various warring feudal states that arose between Temüjin’s sons and grandson in the wake of his death, and father of the Golden Horde. His lands now languish under foreign scoundrels and Slavic fools, taunting us with every misstep. We shall ride into these rightful lands of Tataria and raise the banner of our khanate high over each and every city that once was graced with our ancestor’s rule."

TTR_Revive_Herbi_Shuro:0 "Revive Harbi-Shuro"

TTR_Tatar_Republican_Army:0 "The Tatar National Army"
TTR_Tatar_Republican_Army_desc:0 "To defend our new state from the wrathful forces that surround us, we will need a modern, well-equipped, and sufficiently-trained army.

TTR_Lessons_Of_CW:0 "Lessons of the Civil War"
TTR_Lessons_Of_CW_desc:0 "The Russian Civil War was one of the bloodiest conflicts of the modern era, costing the lives of millions to a foolish conflict over ideology that only caused more problems for these lands. However, if we learned one thing from that hell, it was how to effectively wage war in this new, rapidly evolving era we find ourselves in. From the carcasses and chaos of that fratricide, we shall learn everything we can about doctrine and strategy, better preparing us for the next war."

TTR_Increase_Military_Spending:0 "Rampant Military Spending"
TTR_Increase_Military_Spending_desc:0 "Our hungry and growing military industry needs more capital if it is to sufficiently expand to fit the needs and ambitions of our khanate.

TTR_Mass_Mobilization:0 "Mass Mobilization"
TTR_Mass_Mobilization_desc:0 "We need manpower, and we need it desperately if we are to ever hold a chance against the Russian wave. Every able-bodied man must be taught to hold and fire a rifle, how to clean his kit, and how to ride a horse, among other basics of Tatarian warfare, so that if and when the time comes that their Khan calls on them to serve their nation and their countrymen, we can all rest-assured that they at least know how to shoot a gun."

TTR_Create_National_Doctrine:0 "Create a National Doctrine"
TTR_Create_National_Doctrine_desc:0 "A grand, unified military doctrine of all of our theorems, strategies, tactics, and more must be compiled, organized, and disseminated throughout our nation’s armed forces.

TTR_Smuggle_The_Weapons:0 "Smuggle More Weapons"
TTR_Smuggle_The_Weapons_desc:0 "Every man in Tataria needs to be able to draw a rifle and defend his nation and his countrymen at any moment, but we lack the industrial base to actually achieve this ideal. Instead, we shall resort to back-alley channels and black market ties to source new weapons of war, for Tataria and her peoples will be free, no matter the cost."

TTR_Train_The_Officers:0 "Mandated Training Regimes"
TTR_Train_The_Officers_desc:0 "The officers and the men of our armed forces and militias must be trained and drilled around the clock to ensure their readiness for the coming crusade. They will be pushed to the brink and farther, for if they are true sons of the Mongols, they can surely take it."

TTR_Patriotism_desc:0 "A unified, flourishing Tatarian identity must be cultivated within our khanate, and our people must be made to love our Khan and his regime over all other states and entities.

TTR_Military_Industrial_Complex:0 "Tatar Military-Industrial Complex"
TTR_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc:0 "To further build up the state’s military might and industrial base, the government and our largest manufacturers shall begin to work more closely together, directly feeding into the needs of the other as they accelerate towards rampant, unbridled progress and industrialization in the pursuit of ever-higher ambitions.

Our khanate shall stretch from the Black Sea to the Altai Mountains, and all between shall be under our total command!"

TTR_Airforce:0 "The Tatar Republican Air Force"
TTR_Airforce_desc:0 "Though we have long been masters of the ground, as expert riders and soldiers, the domain above has long eluded us, until now.

TTR_Pursue_Fighter_Development:0 "Pursue Fighter Development"
TTR_Pursue_Fighter_Development_desc:0 "Fighters are the warhorses of the sky, like the horses that carried our ancestors across Eurasia.

TTR_Pursue_Bomber_Development:0 "Pursue Bomber Development"

### Events ###
ttr.10.t:0 "The Harbi-Shuro"
ttr.10.d:0 "On March 28, 1917, the Kazan Muslim Military Council considered the report of Ilyas Alkin with a proposal to create a Tatar Military District in the inner provinces of Russia, in which Muslim soldiers (not only Tatars) would serve in all its territories. At the suggestion of Ilyas Alkin, the congress unanimously adopted a resolution on the creation of Muslim military units. To coordinate this work, a Temporary Muslim Military Council (Harbi-Shuro) of 12 people is already being created throughout the country. The Muslim military units were to become, among other things, a guarantee of the realization of the right of the Muslim peoples to their self-determination.\n\nThe "Whites" in the civil war firmly stood on the positions of the unitary state and with all their might opposed the self-determination of the peoples of Russia. At the same time, the Military Council was sharply anti-Soviet and Harbi-Shuro was eventually liquidated by order of the Council of People's Commissars.\n\nHowever, with the entry of Tatarstan into the Russian Republic as an autonomy, the military forces of the republic were not restored, and the territory came under the full control of the federal Russian Army.\n\nIt is time to remember that we still have power over our land, to restore the Military Council, consisting of Tatars!"

ttr.100.t:0 "Irekle Tatarstan!"
ttr.100.d:0 "After the chaos caused by the Bolsheviks, a coalition of nationalist Tatar parties - I-UMTAB and I-UMB-assumed power in Tatarstan. They are the only ones who are able to protect the national interests of the Tatars from the chauvinist or internationalist intentions of the Bolsheviks. Tatar culture is dying, and only a strong coalition defending our dying nation is able to resist the oppression of Bolshevism!"

ttr.102.t:0 "Tensions Between Bashkirs and Tatars"
ttr.102.d:0 "Despite the initial agreements, there were some contradictions between the delegations of the congress of Idel-Ural Muslim organizations from the Bashkirs and Tatars. Disagreements began from the most insignificant, such as the choice of the state's capital, to the most important - who will become the President of the new state, and how the government will be formed.\n\nThe disagreements resulted in mutual insults and ended in mass riots. Divisions of the Bashkir National Army and detachments of Tatar Legionaries approached the building where the congress was held, and a scuffle broke out between them. To get out of this situation, it is necessary to find a compromise, otherwise there is a risk that the country will fall into a state of civil war.\n\nThe leader of the Tatar Legionaries, Ahmet Timer, recalled the divisions to preserve peace and security, and Galimyan Tagan, the leader of the Bashkir Military Council, followed suit. It seems that the parties began to listen to each other and look for compromises, when suddenly it became known that the leader of I-UTMAB Shafi Almas declared the illegitimacy of the congress and, together with his loyal legionnaires, went to storm the Kazan Kremlin"

### Events for Kazan Khan ###
kazan.10.t:0 "Shafi Seizes the Kazan Kremlin"
kazan.10.d:0 "The Kazan Kremlin is an ancient fortress, the main citadel of Kazan and a symbol of the Tatar state. If Shafi Almas takes over the Kremlin, he will gain power and recognition. It is likely that we should consider his actions as an attempt at a military coup.\n\nBy the arrival of the joint troops of the Tatar legionnaires of Timer and the Bashkir troops of Tagan, the guards guarding the Kremlin were already wounded or killed, and the entrance to the Kremlin was barricaded. Almas ' legionnaires had taken over the building and were now defending its walls. Before the eyes of the Tatar and Bashkir leader, a yellow flag with the image of Zilant, the legendary Tatar dragon, the symbol of the Kazan Khanate, slowly rose above the Kremlin.\n\nImmediately starting the siege of the medieval fortress, the combined Tatar-Bashkir army faced a fierce defense of the Almas legionnaires. A couple dozen were killed, and dozens more were injured. However, the outcome of the battle was not yet decided..."
kazan.10.a:0 "The I-UMB Forces Were Destroyed"
kazan.10.b:0 "The Almas Legionnaires Give Up the Kremlin"

kazan.11.t:0 "In the Halls of Kremlin"
kazan.11.d:0 "Tagan and Timer were soon surrounded in a retaliatory strike and arrested. They were taken to the Kremlin, where they met Almas, dressed in the costume of the Kazan Khan. On his head was a replica of the cap of the Kazan khan. Timer and Tagan couldn't utter a single word, stunned by the sight.\n\nFinally, Almas spoke: 'I, being proclaimed by the Tatar people and called to rule, am the new Khan of Kazan, Shafi. And in accordance with the emergency decrees, I will defend my country and homeland from all those who attempt to destroy it. On behalf of the Tatar people, I sentence you to death by quartering.'\n\nHaving said this, Almas retired in his robes, asking the advisers of the "new khan" to send out to all the newspapers of the world that Khan Shafi of the Almas family had taken the Kazan Kremlin and announced the restoration of the Kazan Khanate, which had perished in time and centuries.'"
kazan.11.a:0 "The Khanate Returns!"

kazan.12.t:0 "In the Halls of Kremlin"
kazan.12.d:0 "Breaking into the fortress, and destroying the last defense of Almas, Timer and Tagan entered the chambers. In the middle of the hall stood Shafi Almas in the costume of the Kazan khan and with a replica of the Khan's hat on his head. He looked stupid and confused. Immediately, he was arrested and taken to the nearest police station, where he would be expected first to spend a night with drunks, and then to be tried for a failed military coup attempt and treason.\n\nHaving extinguished the last hotbeds of the Almas uprising, Timer and Tagan returned to the congress to complete it and make an important decision for the state. Timer was elected the new president of the Idel-Ural State by a majority vote of the delegates."
kazan.12.a:0 "Poor Shafi Almas, maybe he needs treatment..."

kazan.13.t:0 "Empowering Tatar Nobility"
kazan.13.d:0 "In Kazan society, the most privileged classes were the nobility and the clergy. The title of Karachi belonged to the heads of the four most noble Tatar families — Shirin, Bargin, Argyn and Kipchak, and was inherited. Karachi by their position were the closest advisers and de facto co-rulers of the Kazan Khan. Since then, many years have passed and there are no descendants of these noble families. And so the power will pass to those whom we ourselves recognize as the new Kazan nobility. And either they will bend the knee, or they will perish.\n\nAccording to the decree of the Khan of Kazan Shafi, of the Almas family, called the First, representatives of the upper classes of the Tatar nobility must appear at the Khan's palace in the Kazan Kremlin, kneel and swear eternal loyalty to the Khan. If they refuse, they will be executed. If they agree, they will receive lands and a legal title, their children will have the right to inherit their lands and titles, they will be forever loyal to the Khan and serve for the benefit of the Tatar State."
kazan.13.a:0 "And they all agreed..."

kazan.14.t:0 "All-Tatar Kurultai"
kazan.14.d:0 "Immediately summon the Whole Land of Kazan!\n\nAll the nobles, all the Karachis, Emirs and Tarkhans are called to the All-Tatar Kurultai, because we must recognize the legal authority of the Khan, choose the Seyid of Kazan and declare our sovereignty.\n\nA number of important documents will be adopted at the Kurutlai: the Khan's Charter - a set of laws and rules of conduct in the Kazan Khanate. From now on and forever, until the blood of the last Khan of Kazan is shed, which we will never allow, we will recognize him as our sovereign on behalf of all the subjects of Great Tartary. We recognize his authority as sacred and given by Allah for the sake of preserving the Tatar nation and sovereignty, for the sake of the prosperity of the Tatar society, the development of science, folk crafts and culture. From now on and forever, the power of the Khan is irrefutable and is recognized by all members of society as inalienable, irreversible and inescapable. Khan Shafi, of the House of Almas, called the First, is our Khan, our Leader, and our Salvation."
kazan.14.a:0 "We are the new Zemsky Sobor!"

kazan.15.t:0 "Feudalization of Tataria"
kazan.15.d:0 "Now that we have the honorable nobility, we will divide the lands of the Kazan Khanate and give them to the new four most noble families of Kazan - the eternal vassals of the Khan.\n\nBegelma-daruga, Chistai-daruga, Bolgar-daruga and Qazan-daruga will be given to them with the right of use and possession, all the inhabitants of these lands will have to swear allegiance to their suzerains, as they swore allegiance to the Khan. All dissenters will be enslaved or executed-at the discretion of their master, because now they are simply nothing but subjects of the Khan.\n\nTheir duties will include collecting tribute and paying tribute to the Khan, but in exchange they will be able to cultivate these lands, build factories and factories, anything to develop the great Khanate."
kazan.15.a:0 "They shall all obey."

kazan.16.t:0 "Ethnic Cleanses"
kazan.16.d:0 "Only one religion unites the Tatars and only it has the right to exist within the borders of the Khanate. And this is the religion - Islam. Every educated Tatar who is not enslaved is obliged to practice this religion, observe its rules and laws, and anyone who slanders the Prophet or the Khan does not observe our customs and traditions - he simply shits in our country.\n\nFrom now on, by the decree of the Great Khan, all the subjects of the Khanate are obliged to accept Islam and obey its vows. In case of refusal, as always, they will be quartered and destroyed, their ashes will be thrown into the Volga or Kama and carried away by its waves from the lands of the Khanate, because there is no place for the scum of society"
kazan.16.a:0 "One Religion. One Khan."

kazan.17.t:0 "The Zilant Awakens!"
kazan.17.d:0 "A Zilant is a legendary creature with the head of a dragon, the body of a bird, the legs of a chicken, the tail of a snake, the ears of a canine, red wings, sharp teeth, dark-gray feathers and scaly dark-gray skin.\n\nAccording to one story, a beautiful damsel married a resident of Old Kazan. She had to get water from the Qazansu River and complained to the local khan his capital was poorly situated. She advised him to move the city to Zilantaw Hill, and the khan agreed. However, the hill was infested with numerous snakes which were "stout as a log". Their leader was a giant two-headed snake, the Zilant. One head ate only grass, while the other swallowed virgins. A wizard advised the Khan to build a straw and wood near the hill. In spring, the snakes came out from their winter burrows and crept into the pile of straw. A knight errant was sent out to set the pile of straw on fire, burning out the snakes. They were deadly even in death, killing people and horses with their stink. However, the gigantic two-headed snake-dragon escaped to the Qaban lakes. According to the story he still lives in the waters of the lake and, from time to time, takes vengeance on the citizens.\n\nThe Zilant has for long been the symbol of Tataria, symbol of Khan and there's no doubt that it exists... the Khan believes in it anyway, and believes that his strength and power is dependent on Zilant. And now the Zilant has Awakened. By the fire and force of the Zilant, the Kazan Khanate will rebuilt itself and destroy traitorous Russians that still claim that this is their land. It is no more and they shall be taught a lesson."
kazan.17.a:0 "The Zilant Shall Destroy the Muscovy!"

kazan.18.t:0 "The Kazan Khan Captures Moscow"
kazan.18.d:0 "The troops of the great Khan finally laid siege to Moscow and stormed the ancient fortress - a symbol of Russian statehood. Soon, Khan Shafi himself arrived in the capital, who solemnly raised a yellow flag with a zilant over the Kremlin. On the same day, a messenger was immediately dispatched with a telegram to the leader of Muscovy - demanding that he kneel before Khan Shafi of the house of Almas, called the First."

kazan.19.d:0 "A messenger was sent to us with a telegram from the Khan, demanding our immediate surrender. This is a shameful page in the history of our country, but perhaps we should make peace to avoid the complete defeat and death of many of our people at the hands of savages."
kazan.19.a:0 "We surrender!"
kazan.19.b:0 "We'll fight for our Motherland!"

kazan.20.t:0 "Form the Muscovy Ulus?"
kazan.20.d:0 "Finally, we took revenge for the year 1552, when the troops of the damned Ivan the Terrible took Kazan and began the enslavement of our great nation, the descendants of Genghis Khan. We took our revenge and now Moscow is ours. In gratitude for the Russian government's surrender, we will grant them autonomy, but we will impose a tribute on them. Besides, there will be no more Russia. It is time to restore them to their real name and put on the throne a descendant of Genghisid - Prince Yusupov, who will have to swear eternal loyalty to the Khan."
