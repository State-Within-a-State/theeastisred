QIE_the_red_sun_over_the_dragon:0 "The Dragon Rising Anew"
QIE_the_red_sun_over_the_dragon_desc:0 "With NCERA and YCP aligned forces victorious, a direct return to the Qing Empire of old is off the table. Rather, a new Qing is being built each and every day. Before that can be done though, the traitorous Zhili warlords that control large parts of our territory must be dealt with. We need to first secure the northern frontier, eliminating the Zhili garrisons there before turning our eyes south."
QIE_the_red_court:0 "The New Cabinet"
QIE_the_red_court_desc:0 "Prince Chun's reform of abolishing the advisory Grand Council in favor of an Imperial Cabinet was a step in the right direction. Though many saw it as a rebranding of the old Grand Council due to many of its members being chosen for their blood relation to the imperial clan, it still lessened the influence of sycophants and yes-men in the empire's politics. The Xuantong Emperor's new cabinet will instead be staffed with politicans dedicated to the people to truly fufill the promise of reform. The first act of the new government will be the repudiation of all foreign debt accrued by the former collaborator government."
QIE_the_league_of_yellow_dragons:0 "The League of Yellow Dragons"
QIE_the_league_of_yellow_dragons_desc:0 "There are many listless students who have been distraught about the state that China is in. With our anti-concessionist stance being obvious, we will form a new student club organised to spread the ideas of the revolution and attract these young intellectuals searching for something to believe in."
QIE_follow_the_mladrossi_idea:0 "A Benevolent Emperor"
QIE_follow_the_mladrossi_idea_desc:0 "While most in the West think the Emperor of China is some sort of despotic warlord straight out of the Middle Ages, we know that the Emperor is a benevolent and kind soul who wants the best for his subjects. Concerted propaganda efforts must be made to ensure that everyone sees our vision as the truth."
QIE_integration_with_the_csp:0 "Continue our Progress"
QIE_integration_with_the_csp_desc:0 "The original coalition of NCERA and YCP was formed due to our shared dedication to the modernization of China so that she would be able to stand up once again and break the foreign yoke that binds her. We will continue this cooperation as our empire leads China into the future."
QIE_new_five_year_plans:0 "New Five Year Plans"
QIE_new_five_year_plans_desc:0 "If China is to ever be free of foreign exploitation, it will need to industrialize. There will not be a way to take back the concessions if we do not have a military armed with industrial arms. This economic modernization cannot be left to the free market as foreign capitalists and compradors will act in their self interest by keeping China poor to exploit. Instead, our government will need to intervene by doing actions like starting economic ventures and increasing tarriffs on imported goods in order to industrialize our nation."
QIE_attacking_revisionism:0 "For the Common Peasant"
QIE_attacking_revisionism_desc:0 "We are not radical ideologues. The core of our fight is the fight for the dignity of the very real peasant who lives in the fields. During this time working with the YCP, it has become obvious that they only believe in the nebulous idea of modernization without any care for the people living under the empire. Thus it is time to break with them and seek other allies in our quest to create an idyllic paradise for our peasants."
QIE_the_royal_education:0 "Education Modernization and Expansion"
QIE_the_royal_education_desc:0 "China has a long history of education. For many centuries, passing the imperial examination to become a bureaucrat was one of the greatest successes one could achieve. Yet these examinations helped lead China into its current state as they failed to adapt to test the new knowledge that foreigners brought. We shall not bring them back, though their spirit of meritocracy and cultivation of knowledge shall live on as we expand the number of schools all over the empire and modernize their curriculum."
QIE_the_devils_of_warlords:0 "The Devils of Warlords"
QIE_the_devils_of_warlords_desc:0 "With the success of the Xinhai Revolution and the fall of the Qing, a new republic was born. This republic collapsed as the only force keeping it together, military power, split into opposing warlords after the death of Yuan Shikai. These warlords have destroyed the lives of so many people all for their own lust for power and riches. No more! Our government will begin the struggle to unite China and liberate the people from tyranny. Our figurehead of the Xuantong Emperor will also act as the symbol of unity to guide China forwards."
QIE_beiyang_railway:0 "Beiyang Railway"
QIE_beiyang_railway_desc:0 "One of the most important parts of industrialisation is the development of infrastructure due to its multiplier effect on the economy. Thus we will build public infrastructure all over the realm in our pursuit of modernization."
QIE_the_red_mandate:0 "The Red Mandate"
QIE_the_red_mandate_desc:0 "Some might claim it an outdated term, but what is the Mandate of Heaven but not a popular expression of the legitimate will of the government? Our scholars will need to update some texts, but with some work we can distribute propaganda that shows that Puyi is the true and legitimate Emperor of China. This way, even the most diehard conservative will need to concede some ground to the legitimacy of our rule."
QIE_the_yellow_purge:0 "Purging the Bureaucracy"
QIE_the_yellow_purge_desc:0 "With the success of our coup, we were suddenly thrust into power. Though we have managed to temporarily consolidate our rule, many of the government employees came from the time of the Zhili Clique's rule over our nation. These self-interested individuals kept their head low hiding while we dealt with obvious enemies. If we do not seek them out and deal with them, they will linger forever as a stain on our state leeching on the people's livelihood for their own benefit. And in the worst case scenario, they may just become the poisoned dagger stabbed in our back."
QIE_beyond_the_han:0 "Beyond the Han"
QIE_beyond_the_han_desc:0 "China is not just the Han areas, we must include other ethnicities who have been with us for centuries."
QIE_the_will_of_the_people:0 "The Will of the People"
QIE_the_will_of_the_people_desc:0 "Our rule has been for many people, the first time they've ever experienced a government that cares about its citizens. Sick and tired of the Zhili Clique's despotic rule, the masses of the empire support us in our struggle to unite China."
QIE_the_yellow_guards:0 "The Azure Guards"
QIE_the_yellow_guards_desc:0 "Though we have managed to remove the corrupt leeches that we suffered from, we must still stay vigilant. For any amount of tumours could grow in our government as we reunify China and establish our bureaucracy in newly controlled territories. To prevent such a thing from occurring, we will create a new organization to hold our government officials accountable to the people."
QIE_looking_for_allies:0 "A New Old Empire"
QIE_looking_for_allies_desc:0 "We are not just the old Qing brought back to life. The Xuantong Emperor will not abdicate once again. No. We are a new Qing that has learned from history. The Xuantong Emperor serves the people and the people serve him. There will not be another Empress Dowager Cixi whose selfish ambitions helped lead to the fall of the first Qing."
QIE_stoping_rightwing_imperialism:0 "Stopping Western Imperialism"
QIE_stoping_rightwing_imperialism_desc:0 "It was under the Qing when China first suffered at the hands of foreign imperialists. Though the Qing struggled against this domination, like the Hundred Day's Reform undertaken by the Guangxu Emperor, they were not strong enough and fell. This directly led to this disastrous situation of warlords and bandits ruling China. It is now up to our government headed by the Xuantong Emperor to take up this legacy of resistance against the foreign imperialists. "
QIE_the_empire_of_the_red_dragon:0 "The Empire of the Red Dragon"
QIE_the_empire_of_the_red_dragon_desc:0 "Though we have much still to do, we have succeeded in reuniting China. We have been reborn!"

QIEBOL_rebuild_command_structure:0 "Rebuild our Command Structure"
QIEBOL_rebuild_command_structure_desc:0 "The civil war against the Zhili remnants left our high command in tatters. Few of those who remain have much loyalty, and divisions exist independent of the overall order of battle. We must immediately reorganise our forces if we wish to avoid inviting an attack."
QIEBOL_foreigner_against_foreigner:0 "Foreigner Against Foreigner"
QIEBOL_foreigner_against_foreigner_desc:0 "While the German scum polluted our nation with their delusional ideas of racial 'superiority', few denied their military prowess. We should seek out non-aligned foreign agents to help train our military, even if this slightly contradicts our new anti-concession stance. A prepared military is worth a few angry intellectuals."
QIEBOL_look_to_our_past:0 "Look to our Past"
QIEBOL_look_to_our_past_desc:0 "Instead of turning to the foreigners, let us instead look to the past for inspiration on how to reform our military. The tried and true methods of the Warlord Era are still effective, and will allow us to destroy our enemies."
QIEBOL_assess_doctrines:0 "Assess Doctrines"

QIEBOL_rural_defense_force:0 "Found the Rural Defence Forces"
QIEBOL_rural_defense_force_desc:0 "For too long the peasantry of China have been terrorized by roving warbands of looters and bandits. The NCERA has proposed enacting a system whereby each village will have its own defence force equipped with obsolete rifles. While of dubious military use, they will be useful at harassing enemies and making our territory costly to occupy."
QIEBOL_prepare_dikes:0 "Prepare the Dikes"
QIEBOL_prepare_dikes_desc:0 "The dikes along the Yellow river present a possibility for a drastic strike against the Japanese. Should we open them while enemy forces are advancing, the floodwaters will slow their progress immensely and make give our forces a better chance at defending the area."
QIEBOL_exploit_baoding_contacts:0 "Exploit Baoding Contacts"
QIEBOL_exploit_baoding_contacts_desc:0 "The Baoding Military Academy has contracts with military academies and arsenals all around China, even in areas controlled by ostensible enemies. With enough funding, these contracts could be persuaded to join our side, bringing with them their experience and technical expertise. "

QIEBOL_best_money_can_buy:0 "The Best Money Can Buy"
QIEBOL_best_money_can_buy_desc:0 "The Manchu nobility grew rich over the last decade of idleness. We should 'encourage' that this money instead be spent on hiring military advisers from the other war colleges in China, many of which can be encouraged to join our side with a large bag of cash."
QIEBOL_imperial_propaganda:0 "Imperial Propaganda"
QIEBOL_imperial_propaganda_desc:0 "In order to defeat our foes, we must instil a complete loyalty to the Emperor in our troops. They must be willing to lay down their lives if necessary to protect their sovereign and the promise and future he represents for China."
QIEBOL_manchu_naval_academy:0 "Found the Imperial Naval Academy"
QIEBOL_manchu_naval_academy_desc:0 "The Qing Navy was largely trained by European schools. While it is a secondary or tertiary concern at the moment, we should still devote some funding to training our naval cadets here rather than overseas."
QIEBOL_manchu_air_warfare:0 "Study European Air Tactics"
QIEBOL_manchu_air_warfare_desc:0 "While we would like to take as little as possible from the foreign devils, there is no debate that their mastery over aerial warfare is undisputed. We should study their doctrine and tactics, so that we may apply them to our own air force."
QIEBOL_expand_baoding_rnd:0 "Found Baoding Military Research Department"
QIEBOL_expand_baoding_rnd_desc:0 "With our military fully reformed along modern lines, we should set out to create an institution that allows our forces to keep abreast of the latest technological innovations. By creating a fully independent Baoding Military Research Department, our forces will have the technical backing to go toe-to-toe with any army in the world."
QIEBOL_destroy_concessions:0 "Eradicate the Concessions"
QIEBOL_destroy_concessions_desc:0 "The Legation Cities are a stain on China's sovereignty and independence. While trade with the West is permissible, the cities are relics of the Century of Humiliation and have no place in our modern government. With the rest of the world embroiled in chaos now is the perfect moment to strike and reclaim our lost cities!"
QIEBOL_destroy_germany:0 "Götterdämmerung"
QIEBOL_destroy_germany_desc:0 "The German concessions in Shandong have allowed the foul Teutons to pollute our country for too long! We must take back these outposts of foreign imperialism while they are distracted at war in Europe."
QIEBOL_false_republic:0 "Dealing with the Northern Traitors"
QIEBOL_false_republic_desc:0 "The fools to the north claim to be the 'last bastion' of China's legitimate government. In reality they are little more than Japanese lapdogs. While they slavishly serve their masters we should strike and reclaim our homeland!"

QIEBOL_prepare_shanxi:0 "The Shanxi Problem"
QIEBOL_prepare_shanxi_desc:0 "Though Governor Yan was instrumental to the success of our takeover of the realm, the current status of Shanxi has become a thorn in our side. Many opposition groups have pointed out that our previous reliance on a warlord to take power does not bode well for the future of our promises of a united China. We must prove them wrong by integrating Shanxi into the empire as a province one way or another lest the people fall to apathy."
QIEBOL_rural_loyalty:0 "Rural Loyalty Ensured"
QIEBOL_rural_loyalty_desc:0 "The NCERA has completed its major rural reform plan and secured its hold on government.
