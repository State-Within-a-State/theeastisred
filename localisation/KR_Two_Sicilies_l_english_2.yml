SIC_aristocratic_funding:0 "Aristocratic Funding"
SIC_aristocratic_funding_desc:0 "While our cause was already supported by a handful of aristocratic exiles our victory should remove doubt as to our ability to come to power.

SIC_a_proper_king:0 "A Real King"
SIC_a_proper_king_desc:0 "It's finally time to finally replace the liberal, foreign Bourbon rule whose very existence was a mockery to our traditions with our traditional nobles.

SIC_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
SIC_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
SIC_hit_papacy:0 "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SIC_hit_papacy_desc:0 "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership.

SIC_platonic_church:0 "A Platonic Church"
SIC_platonic_church_desc:0 "The Papal States armies may have fallen but the Church itself still has too much influence to do away with at the moment.

SIC_ghibelline_revival:0 "Ghibelline Revival"
SIC_ghibelline_revival_desc:0 "Against the Mercantilist Guelphs the Ghibelline understood that spiritual power should rest with the Emperor alone. Their loss helped usher in the fall of man from rule by the Nobles to Mercantilists so we must revive their legacy.

SIC_patriarchial_traditions_desc:0 "While the correlation between masculinity and greatness is undeniable many of our foes insist on forms of "female equality" against all hard evidence to the contrary that this is a degeneration of society.

SIC_heroic_idealism:0 "Heroic Idealism"
SIC_heroic_idealism_desc:0 "It is through heroic experiences that we not only create men but super-men whom display the best of their race and find themselves in war, until the act becomes holy itself.

SIC_sardinias_final_offer_desc:0 "Sardinia rightfully belongs to the House of Savoy and while Amadeo's stance against the socialists is admirable it is not his place to dispute Emmanuel's claim.

SIC_magical_societies:0 "Occult Societies"
SIC_magical_societies_desc:0 "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism. Occult societies will encourage brotherhood, faith and cooperation between the Order and their admirers and accelate our society toward containing at its core an esoteric soul."
SIC_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"
SIC_constrained_science_desc:0 "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration.

SIC_spiritual_casteism:0 "Spiritual Casteism"
SIC_spiritual_casteism_desc:0 "At long last the King and our Warrior-Nobility have established total dominance. We must now recognize our internal races, or castes, so that each individual may live up to their full potential as they were intended to.

### Events ###

sic.1.t:0 "The Legacy of the Civil War"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which lasted until 1860 when Sardinia-Piedmont, aided by Garibaldi's partisans, united Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoyards, who did not care much for industrialising the south, and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Italy eventually chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians achieved victory against the Savoyards and reformed the kingdom into the Italian Federation. Civil war soon convulsed the peninsula, and the Austrian, Federation, and White Republican forces barely held the Syndicalists at the Po and Abruzzo Line. When the syndicalists threatened the south in 1927, Austria's promises of protection vanished... and while the war never materialized, the worth of the Federation was revealed. Both Two Sicilies and Sardinia withdrew, leaving Austria's only place of influence the republic in the north."
sic.1.a:0 "Now we are on our own!"

sic.200.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"
sic.200.d:0 "Since the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been mostly focused internally. The Christian Democrats, in power since 1921, trying to pursue the age-old dream of land reform in the South. The lack of progress on this front, however, caused the Christian Democrat supermajority to fail in 1927, though a democratic coalition has kept power since, and made some small movements toward land reform in Campania and Capua. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Doje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics, and only time will tell if they get to achieve their reactionary aims or if democracy will prevail."
sic.200.a:0 "Long live the kingdom!"

sic.201.t:0 "The Second Risorgimento"
sic.201.d:0 "As for the future of Italy, questions have slowly arisen regarding our place in the coming conflict. Peace on the peninsula is held by a delicate balance: if the syndicalists strike, they must do so without drawing the Third Internationale into battle with them. Should they do so, both Germany and Austria will feel compelled to intervene. They will not, however, feel so compelled if Two Sicilies strikes first. So it is on the Socialist Republic of Italy to make the first move towards a Second Risorgimento, and they must do so without French backing. We must keep a careful watch on the Abruzzo line, to see if they become so bold."
sic.201.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

sic.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Kingdom"
sic.2.d:0 "The economic crisis that began in Germany has spiralled out of control and spread to Italy. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies' prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and confidence in the government has been shaken."
sic.2.a:0 "May God protect us!"

sic.3.t:0 "Poverty and Crime Rises"
sic.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting our kingdom hard, it has caused poverty to skyrocket and the living standards of many Sicilians to drop. At the same time, the various criminal cartels have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased out in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something. However the power of local nobles and their opposition to Bourbon power makes it difficut to take the most drastic steps needed to end this depression until their power is dealt with."
sic.3.a:0 "Something must be done!"

sic.4.t:0 "The Camicie Nere"
sic.4.d:0 "With the rise of crime in the country due to Black Monday, the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale have been formed. The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo and everything in between. Supposedly lead by Achille Starace, this paramilitary organization is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left wing. Joining Starace is the more controversial Julius Evola whom was only reluctantly allowed into the organization for his far-right monarchist views and the small but fanatical following he brings with him, especially amongst the sons of the upper-class. Nonetheless his past anti-Papal and anti-Bourbon views marks him as divisive even within the Camicie Nere but the black-shirts desire a broad alliance... for now. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
sic.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them."

sic.5.t:0 "A Call for New Leadership"
sic.5.d:0 "The Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi, has given a stern and powerful sermon claiming that the government's Social Conservative policies are ruining the kingdom and are at fault for Black Monday. He says that it is time for the kingdom to have new leadership with new ideas. Many that support the Social Liberal Democrazia Cristiana have taken this as a sign, and are energised by his rhetoric."
sic.5.a:0 "May God protect the kingdom"

sic.6.t:0 "The Liberal Coalition"
sic.6.d:0 "Since the founding of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, parliamentary power has been contested primarily by the Social Conservatives and the Social Liberals. However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Conservative party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Democratico Cristiano. For the liberals though there is hope that this new coalition will keep the torch of liberalism strong within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies."
sic.6.a:0 "The torch of liberalism shall not fail"
sic.6.b:0 "The new coalition galvanizes opposition"

sic.7.t:0 "Fighting between the Left and Right"
sic.7.d:0 "A rally by the Confederazione Generale Siciliana del Lavoro or the 'Sicilian General Confederation of Labor' for the ruling Partito Democratico Cristiano was disrupted when members of the Camicie Nere disrupted their rally. This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."
sic.7.a:0 "The Union members are innocent"
sic.7.b:0 "They are disloyal traitors"

sic.10.t:0 "The [GetYear] Sicilian Elections"

However more religiously fervent and morally disgusted members of the Integralist coalition, including Bernardo Attolico, Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo have refused to pledge loyalty and simply stated that they would continue to oppose "demonic demagoguery".

The King has reassured the people he is merely opposing the presently pseudo-Christian Vatican for weakening the state while Evola has privately done the opposite with the Legion and declared the Holy War against darkness as truly beginning.

Nonetheless from the supplies found it is both clear they were receiving foreign funding and, more importantly, have lost too much to recover as they have been chipped away at for too long to handle a blow of this size. While not all citizens have embraced us this may mark the end of our largest internal political resistance.

Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classical civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society.

He then looked to the crowd and saw that nearly half of whom showed their thumbs to symbolize finishing the fallen foe with his sword, while the rest showed compressed fists that hid their thumb to symbolize sparing the man and sheathing the sword. Unsure of what to do he looked to the king to decide."
sic.1330.a:0 "He fought well, a compressed fist"
sic.1330.b:0 "He should've fought to the end, thumb up" 

sic.1340.t:0 "A Champion Emerges"
sic.1340.d:0 "In the gladiatorial ring those few whom have the potential to be truly brutal and courageous heroes are separated from the pseudo-masculine lowlifes. One such man, Francesco Calì, has emerged as a champion in the arena, surviving at least 18 games. A former soldier and footballer whom was arrested for being a suspected anti-Legion integralist supporter his Lord now looks upon him with great esteem and lavishly rewards him for his fighting ability. Perhaps it is time to reward him for good by making him a commander of the Legion?"
sic.1340.a:0 "Make him a Legion Commander"
sic.1340.b:0 "Keep him as a Lavished Fighter"

sic.1350.t:0 "Women's Role Enforced"
sic.1350.d:0 "The Law of Women's Stature has been passed, effectively meaning that women can no longer work in many industries, own land or choose their own husbands. The patriarch of the family now holds a monopoly on his household though some argue that we should at least allow women to be nurses and, as far as our Occultist followers are concerned, priestesses."
sic.1350.a:0 "They may be Priestesses or nurses"
sic.1350.b:0 "They are either wives or maids"

sic.1360.t:0 "Destroying Materialistic Hedonism"
sic.1360.d:0 "With our society establishing the norm of asceticism and fighting for what Baron Evola celebrates as the triumph of Roman values over fatalistic Etruscan ones many of the Knights have begun to sell off valuables that are viewed as overly ornate or comforting and are expecting citizens to do the same. Some of our followers have even begun to raid taverns that are viewed as promoting hedonistic activities that posses no higher spiritual value. This line-of-thinking includes overthrowing the remaining banks, corporations and foreign owned properties that are viewed as disloyal or corrupt and putting them under the Kings domain and destroying utterly useless 'technologies' such as television. All of the collected materials are seemingly going towards the military whenever possible."
sic.1360.a:0 "Excellent"

sic.1370.t:0 "Racial Laws Ordered"
sic.1370.d:0 "The Radical Traditionalists have long believed in a form of spiritual racism, in which blood contains the psychological elements of tradition and provides the life-force for a people. With this racial mixing has been banned and the Aryan-Roman has a clearly higher status than others within our territory. The question now remains of how to treat those of minority ancestry with two proposals given. One is to allow them to organize into their own hierarchies modeled on our values for those whom pledge loyalty to the King, pay tribute, pledge soldiers to our wars and acknowledge the Kings and his Nobles supremacy. This way we can use the best of the aristocratic spirit that exists amongst themselves for our own purposes. Or as Arthur Reghini and much of the Legion have strongly pushed for we could simply place them in our lowest class and let them prove themselves in combat when the time comes."
sic.1370.a:0 "Organize their hierarchies... loyal to ours"
sic.1370.b:0 "Their rightful place is always beneath us"
sic.1370.c:0 "It shall be a case by case basis"

sic.1380.t:0 "Corvee System"
sic.1380.d:0 "With our attacks on traditional capitalism and encroachment of a Caste system some of our serfs simply do not have the means of providing taxes to the Legion. However this is once again an opportunity to learn from our ancestors rather than institute a crude monetary system by instituting the Corvee System which will replace taxes for those whom can't pay them with required days of government directed labor. Corvees will have greater rights than the class beneath them, the slaves, but nonetheless are required to carry out their work. The labor this will provide us with will also allow our economy to exit the worst that Black Monday caused, for whatever that's worth."
sic.1380.a:0 "Consumerist woes will soon be behind us regardless"

sic.1390.t:0 "Sardinia Demanded"
sic.1390.d:0 "Two Sicilies under Ferdinand III have demanded the integration of Sardinia into their territory, with the letter noting that he represents the primary Savoyard line and that his exile was a temporary tactical retreat. He thanks Amadeo for holding the territory for the good of the royal house and notes he will be rewarded when he acknowledges the rightful King."
sic.1390.a:0 "We must accept"
sic.1390.b:0 "Never!"

sic.1400.t:0 "Sardinia Accepts"
sic.1400.d:0 "Unsurprisingly given his lack of legitimacy in the region, our Kings higher prestige, military advantage and our support even amongst his own nobles Amadeo has done what he should have weeks ago and accepted our offer. We may now integrate his Nobles into our Order and enforce Legion law there with Amadeo giving liberals and socialists three days to flee. Though the question of how to reward Amadeo remains... we could grant him Sardinia as a Duchy though as we are aware he would likely be a more liberal leader than we prefer, so we could simply make it a titular title and grant him wealth. Or we could give him the prestige of being in charge of a Legion garrison though again he would likely be too tied to modern forms of warfare."
sic.1400.a:0 "Give him the Duchy of Sardinia"
sic.1400.b:0 "The Duchy of Sardinia... in name only"
sic.1400.c:0 "Make him a Legion Commander"

sic.1410.t:0 "Sardinia Declines"
sic.1410.d:0 "In a grotesque display of treachery and lack of respect for his betters Amadeo has refused to integrate Sardinia into the Legion, calling the Legion "The King's mad dogs". While our King is furious Evola is pleased for a chance for the Legion to experience war."
sic.1410.a:0 "Take Sardinia NOW"

sic.1430.d:0 "The battle for Palermo was bloody but finally we have managed to break the rebellion in the city and are now pushing our way into rural hideouts, interrogating any villagers suspected of working with them. With mobsters fleeing the area and rebels being destroyed the region is ours albeit it at a high cost. Nonetheless their loss has helped to demoralize resistance to our regime. But perhaps we should set more of an example?"
sic.1430.a:0 "Sicily is now a Legion outpost"
sic.1430.b:0 "Sicily is now our serfs"
sic.1430.c:0 "Just Purge all whom may be treacherous"

sic.1440.t:0 "Esoteric Developments"
sic.1440.d:0 "There have long been rumors has to Evola and his closest followers interest in magic and the esoteric but it seems that his views have spread to some of the Nobles and Legion members, whom are now taking an interest in reading his literature and gaining access to books that profess the new faith. Overall they are still a fringe but among those whom believe their support is strong, they practice asceticism and many in the Legion whom are superstituous are shifting towards such views."
sic.1440.a:0 "Support them"

sic.1450.t:0 "Occult Nobles"
sic.1450.d:0 "Seeing our increasing triumph in religious terms, an increasing number of Legion members and are said to be practicing occult rituals for good luck before battle and are growing stricter in their personal belief in and practice of Evola's Occultist Faith of Tradition. Even the Nobility whom follow Evolianism have taken an increasing interest in the faith and its fetishism of them."
sic.1450.a:0 "Excellent"

sic.1460.t:0 "Superstitious Citizens"
sic.1460.d:0 "Most of our citizens know little about the occultism present among much of the Legion and our loyal Nobility but with our growing success and the Religion of Tradition gaining traction at the expense of the Papacy many are beginning to believe in it to some degree, even if it is limited to fearing the magical powers of Evola and his inner circle or simply feeling that loyalty to the papacy is growing increasingly pointless. As such they are less willing to work with the enemy and even the common soldiers pay more respect to the faith despite its demanding nature."
sic.1460.a:0 "Wonderful!"

sic.1470.t:0 "Primordial Revival"
sic.1470.d:0 "The Faith of Tradition has become a true religious minority in our territory and the Kings word now at least rivals that of the Papacy among his followers. With many citizens hoping to appease the forces around them many are performing rituals for good luck and attempting to hex their enemies, and a syncretism of Catholicism and Evolian occultism has grown in prominence. Traditional followers of Catholicism are dismayed at this but are becoming increasingly reluctant to confront it as they are now uncertain of where even their own neighbors sympathies lay."
sic.1470.a:0 "As Long as They Don't Hex Us"

sic.1480.t:0 "King's Spiritual Power"
sic.1480.d:0 "The Papacy's monopoly over our populations spiritual life has finally been broken! The Kings word is followed by a large enough sect of the people, and nearly all of the Legion and Nobility, that he functionally has more influence that the Pope does within our society especially since the Papacy-in-exile has extreme difficulties communicating with their followers here. For those whom believe in the King they would gladly die in battle if he ordered them to."
sic.1480.a:0 "May He Live Forever!"

sic.1490.t:0 "Dominance of Evolian Tradition"
sic.1490.d:0 "We have finally revived the old world! Even though most of the population still holds private sympathies for Traditional Catholicism it has nonetheless been driven underground in favor the Religion of Tradition. Our military fights well knowing that higher powers watch over their every victory, many citizens observe the striptures of the Warrior-Priests out of fear of their powers and the next generation will be far less Catholic than their predecessors."

However the Mercantilist class begs to have an exception made for them, noting they need these vehicles to move wares. While they are already being allowed to keep a handful of trucks Legion inspectors say is absolutely needed for supply they argue it would be more efficient for the economy if they let them keep more of their vehicles."

sic.1590.t:0 "Papal States demanded"
sic.1590.d:0 "The Papacy knew it was only a matter of time before the madness that has possessed Sicily came for them, especially after they moved to limit their influence in the region. We have received a demand to give up our autonomy under threat of war by those bastardos Emmanuel and Evola! However with socialists to our north many advisors are claiming we do not stand a chance and that leaving them Rome is the lesser of two evils while we evacuate clerics from the area. However others are claiming that Evola is a pagan and that we should go down fighting. What shall we do?"
sic.1590.a:0 "Surrender"
sic.1590.b:0 "We have God on our side! Fight!"

sic.1600.t:0 "Papacy Caves In" 
sic.1600.d:0 "Squeezed by enemies on all sides the Papacy decided it would be better to evacuate many of their bureaucrats and surrender the region to Victor Emmanuel III, a known longtime enemy of the church, rather than lose everything in a pointless war. However they still encouraged Catholics to resist the regime on the way out. Nonetheless it appears both Emmanuel and Evola have triumphed over their old for." 
sic.1600.a:0 "Finally!"

sic.1610.t:0 "The King and The Baron" 
sic.1610.d:0 "It appears as though the bond between King Emmanuel III and his High-Chancellor, Baron Julius Evola, has grown in recent months. The two hold many shared opinions on the King's powers and dignity, on culture and on the proper way of living ones life and both often unite in their hatred of the Catholic Church, liberals, socialists, politicians, progressives, democratic conservatives, Bourbons, anti-colonialists, republicans, "soft" men, insubordinate women and hedonists. Hunting trips, fishing and hiking are an increasingly common past-times for the two as they review stately material and has shifted the King into accepting even more right-wing positions than he hold before."

sic.1620.d:0 "To the great pain of the Legion and especially to his close political ally Julius Evola, King Victor Emmanuel III has passed on due to a heart attack. He will be entombed in the capital while his son, Umberto II, takes the throne with Evola remaining his advisor."
sic.1620.a:0 "Long Live Umberto II!"

sic.1630.t:0 "Legion Sympathies" 
sic.1630.d:0 "We have established fruitful relations with the Romanian Iron Guard, with a handful even being sent over to help us stabilize the situation. They have already agreed to our idea for a defensive alliance, something more of our advisors support as it will still allow us to be flexible in our foreign policy. Most legionaries would prefer an outright alliance led by Two-Siciles but our advisors are claiming we simply would not have the strength to fight all of our enemies between just the two of us and a defensive alliance is more practical."

An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. The cell volunteered to stay behind to secure the evacuation and once they had left told the military and navy they were now in the services of Two Sicilies. A true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him, whom are now doing all they can to convince the populace this "treachery" was planned in conjunction with the House of Savoy."

It appears the Count heard about this and as a known champion fencer has requested the chance the duel the young man to the first blood or, failing that, the death. There is no question the Count would win and Evola has advised the King to allow it for the King's time is too important to micromanage every petty dispute of honor among the upper-class and that duels will encourage a culture of "truth, bravery and honor". More cautious on-lookers think the King should let his Court of Advisors simply settle these types of disputes themselves when the King does not have the time or desire to manage them."

This failed of course but due to our reputation they decided to fight to the last man and women which made it especially costly to us, with the event already being called the Pillage of Catanzaro. More pressingly however the revolt only seemed to get out of hand because local soldiers decided to retreat instead of fighting them as ordered by their legionary commanders! We will need to set a precendent to make sure this does not happen again. The most popular proposal is to revive the Roman practice of decimatio, in which all of the disobedient soldiers will draw from a lottery and the ten percent who get the "losing straws" will be beaten to death by their comrades. Less popular proposals include leaving it in the hand of the commanders of themselves at the cost of the King's authority or wiping out every coward which, while tempting, would cost us much cannon fodder in our war against socialism. Of course this will also be setting a precedent for the future."
