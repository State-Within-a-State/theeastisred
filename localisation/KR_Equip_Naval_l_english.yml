ship_hull_submarine_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy raiding vessels. Heavy submarines are larger and more powerful, with a longer operational range, and some surface-to-surface and shore bombardment capability."
ship_hull_cruiser:0 "Cruiser"
ship_hull_cruiser_desc:0 "A medium screening vessel. Its primary duty is to shield capital ships from enemy light ships, but it can also unleash powerful torpedoes that can hurt bigger ships."
ship_hull_panzerschiff:0 "Armoured Cruiser"
ship_hull_panzerschiff_desc:0 "Armoured cruisers are medium-sized ships carrying fairly heavy guns. They are best used for engaging smaller warships, though they can also function as budget capital ships."
ship_hull_light:0 "Destroyer"
ship_hull_light_desc:0 "The lightest screening vessel. Its job is to defend larger ships and to find and destroy submarines, and it can also menace unescorted capital ships."
ship_hull_carrier:0 "Carrier"
ship_hull_carrier_desc:0 "A capital ship able to carry wings of powerful carrier capable aircraft into battle. Also useful as a floating airfield you can position off the coast of your enemy."
ship_hull_heavy_carrier:0 "Heavy Carrier"
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_desc:0 "Heavy carriers are usually based on battleship or dreadnought designs, which means they are huge and heavily armoured, but also very expensive."
ship_hull_fast_battleship:0 "Battleship"
ship_hull_fast_battleship_desc:0 "Battleships are mid-level capital ships with all-round performance. They balance speed, armour, and firepower, but don't excel in any area."

ship_hull_dreadnought_desc:0 "The largest capital ship with the biggest guns and strongest armour that money can buy. Such an expensive investment deserves proper support of smaller screening ships."


#ship_hull_dreadnought_0:0 "Dreadnought Battleship Hull"
#ship_hull_dreadnought_0_desc:0 "The Dreadnought (constructed 1905-6) revolutionized capitol warship design, instantly rendering obsolete all previous battleships and triggering a naval arms race between Britain and Germany. Her 'all big gun' main armament was significantly more powerful than the mixed batteries of pre-Dreadnoughts, and her steam turbine propulsion granted her superior speed. Navies around the world rushed to copy the British design, leading to an explosion in naval spending and a major increase in the firepower afloat. Most were armed with ten to twelve main guns, in twin turrets, of 11 to 12 inches or equivalent."
ship_hull_dreadnought_1:0 "Pre Weltkrieg Dreadnought Hull" #Improved
ship_hull_dreadnought_1_desc:0 "A jump in size over preceding Dreadnoughts, these 'super-Dreadnoughts' were the escalation of the design innovations of the Dreadnought designs. Faster, with heavier armour, their major distinguishing feature was their superior armament: most carried five twin turrets, with guns of 12 to 13.5 inch or equivalent, arraigned so as to allow all to fire broadside and with fore and aft turrets in a superfiring configuration. This heavier, more concentrated, firepower made them considerably more deadly than the early Dreadnought classes, and these designs would enter the Weltkrieg as the leading warships of major navies. While eclipsed by the new classes devised during the war, they remained formidable warships, and many would remain in service, especially in secondary fleets, for many years after it ended."
weltkrieg_dreadnought_hull_nonmtg:0 "Weltkrieg Dreadnought Hull"
weltkrieg_dreadnought_hull_nonmtg_desc:0 "Designed shortly before the Weltkrieg began, and completed while it raged, these classes represented the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and would remain highly potent long after it ended. While they were notably faster than the Dreadnoughts before them their most notable differentiating feature was their escalated armament: they carried eight to ten main guns, of 14 to 15 inch or equivalent, most in twin turrets but a few in new triple turrets. Their devastating firepower and heavy armour guaranteed that they would be at the heart of their battle fleets, but those continued advances came at quickly escalating prices. Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."

ship_hull_dreadnought_2_desc:0 "Designed shortly before the Weltkrieg began, and completed while it raged, these classes represented the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and would remain highly potent long after it ended.

Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."
#ship_hull_dreadnought_2_5:0 "Late Weltkrieg Dreadnought Hull"
#ship_hull_dreadnought_2_5_desc:0 "Incorporating the lessons of first real major naval battles of the Dreadnought Age, most notably the First Battle of Jutland, these designs were highly convergent: increased speed, ever heavier armour, and a main armament of four twin 16 to 16.5 inch or equivalent guns in a two fore, two aft superfiring turret configuration, though some later designs of the type added a fifth turret. Such powerful warships came at great price, and their construction exerted considerable strain on those nations that built them. While begun during the Weltkrieg none were completed in time to take part in it, and as a result their designs remained largely untested. Produced in far greater numbers than the mammoth ships that followed them, these classes would form the cores of most of the world's major navies long after the war, and all the way into the 1930s."
ship_hull_dreadnought_3:0 "Interwar Dreadnought Hull" #Heavy
ship_hull_dreadnought_3_desc:0 "The rapid increase of resources devoted to naval construction after the end of major land conflict during the Weltkrieg initially produced these designs, which featured the beginnings of the trends towards sudden growth in size, firepower, armour, calibre and of course, cost. Such vessels set the world's leading naval powers apart from the mere pretenders to greatness, but they had their issues; their rapid development and rushed construction led to design flaws and persistent mechanical problems. These designs were armed with eight to ten 18 inch or equivalent main guns, and had the protection to go toe-to-toe with similarly armed ships."
ship_hull_dreadnought_4:0 "Improved Dreadnought Hull" #Super Heavy
ship_hull_dreadnought_4_desc:0 "As the Dreadnought Race reached its height, these true monsters were conceived. Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost was staggering, and few nations could afford to even consider constructing them. Nonetheless, those that did found themselves in possession of truly mighty weapons of naval supremacy. Even more so than the generation before them, they suffered from the conditions of their conception. Rushed design work, last minute and improvised redesigns during construction, shortages of the huge amount of resources they required, immense pressure to rush construction, and the sheer size and complexity of their massive mechanisms, all led to design flaws and vulnerabilities beneath their vast armoured hides. These designs were armed with twelve to fifteen 18 inch or equivalent main guns."
ship_hull_dreadnought_5:0 "Advanced Dreadnought Hull"
ship_hull_dreadnought_5_desc:0 "Once the afterglow of the great Dreadnought Race had faded away, naval designers took stock of the position of dreadnoughts in future planning. Discarding speed as a major goal, with the understanding that the new generation of so-called 'fast battleships' would assume that task, these designs instead focused on extreme, unprecedented, armour protection. Advanced 16 inch guns could equal the armour penetration of 18 inches, while being less expensive. .Drawing lessons from the navies possessing heavy ordinance most of these designs were armed with those types of advanced 16 inch guns, or equivalents, normally arranged in five triple turrets."
ship_hull_dreadnought_6:0 "Modern Dreadnought Hull"
ship_hull_dreadnought_6_desc:0 "Even as most navies, with varying degrees of reluctance and dismay, were forced to concede the ascendancy of carriers over traditional gun warships, some naval designers still dreamed of creating the 'ultimate battleship'. Girded in nearly impenetrable armour, bristling with anti-aircraft batteries, and armed with six triple 16 inch turrets or equivalent extreme armament, these designs represented the very pinnacle of heavy warship design. Conceived in the twilight of the age of gun warships, these designs were seen as obsolete even before their drafting was completed, mainly by the advocates of ascendant airpower."

interwar_heavy_carrier_hull_nonmtg_desc:0 "The first large aircraft carriers, these ships were built on hulls that were originally intended for capital warships but, for various reasons, converted and completed as carriers. Only a handful of navies built such ships, and their designs varied greatly; their aircraft capacities ranged from the low sixties to over a hundred. There were constants though, such as retained heavily armoured belts and other gun-warship features. Semi-experimental and unreliable, they were still incredibly formidable weapons, and laid the foundations for following generations of fleet carriers."

ship_hull_heavy_carrier_2:0 "Improved Heavy Carrier Hull" #Early
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "The first fleet carriers designed entirely to be such, most of these ships were significantly smaller than their predecessors, but, due to being intentionally centred on the requirements of naval aviation, were also far more reliable in that role. With better anti-aircraft defenses and properly designed runways, they generally carried around sixty aircraft."
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_3:0 "Advanced Heavy Carrier Hull" #Improved
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_3_desc:0 "Continued development of fleet carrier design led to much larger models, with even higher capacities. Increased range and better design of internal systems allowed them to function more effectively as not only part of the fleet, but the centre of one. They retained the features of previous heavy carriers, large secondary batteries to engage enemy vessels at close range and a heavily armoured belt for protection. Most carried around seventy aircraft and with the new deck-edge elevators they were highly efficient at getting those craft into combat as quickly as possible."
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_4:0 "Modern Heavy Carrier Hull"
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_4_desc:0 "The final pre-nuclear evolution of fleet carrier design, these ships approached the size of the first fleet carriers, while incorporating all of the design improvements made in the intervening years. Most had significant armour protection and withering AA firepower, while also being highly mechanically reliable. However, they had given up their large calibre secondary armament in exchange for dual purpose 100-127mm guns. Their general aircraft capacity was, on average, around eighty."
