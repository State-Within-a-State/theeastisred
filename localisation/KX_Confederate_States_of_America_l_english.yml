### Ideas ###
FSA_segregation:0 "Jim Crow Laws"
FSA_segregation_desc:0 "For the longest time, race has been a heated debate in America. But, with the collapse of the United States, the debate has come to a boiling point here in Dixieland. With Blacks now comprising more than 20% of the population, Dixie must decide if the Black man will be an equal or a lesser to the White man."
FSA_atlanta_fire:0 "The Great Atlanta Fire"
FSA_atlanta_fire_desc:0 "The Great Atlanta Fire is a bleeding wound in Dixie's side. The catastrophe took the lives of many fine Southerners, and left many more homeless. However, the South has faced worse, and this disaster may become yet another passing memory, as the nation rebuilds."
FSA_southern_aristocracy:0 "The Southern Aristocracy"
FSA_southern_aristocracy_desc:0 "Our aristocratic ruling class has been in power in the South since before even the War of Northern Aggression. Their influence survived the war and has continued to plague Dixie's economy by refusing to diversify. To them, cotton is, and forever will be, king."
