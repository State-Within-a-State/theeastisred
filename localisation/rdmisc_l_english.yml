shandong.464.desc:0 "After the fall of the republic, a growth in leftist activity started in Shandong with small socialist clubs forming. One of those clubs was the Shandong Revolutionary Club in which promoted socialist nationalism and an ideology known as anti-Japaneseism. After the Qing's restoration the club was shutdown and its members under ground, as a result one of its members, Xi Zhongxun in 1933 forms the 8th Route Army with symbolic irony of the eight powers who humiliated China. Now since the collapse of the Qing, Xi has been able to gather more support and further strengthen his 8th Army. The main concern of the army is how it treats those of Japanese support or origin as the are is anti-japan in varying degrees.  Tho also brings about socialists policies that do appease the local population. In recent days Shandong intelligence hasn't heard a thing of their whereabouts. Now there is a concern that they have something big going underway."
shandong.465.desc:0 "Out of nowhere red banners fly over the horizon just outside the provincial capital of Jinan. The Shandong army is caught off guard as most of its army away from the capital. As the red bandits draw closer the sounds of horse are heard as cavalry tear through the regiment based in Jinan. After a few hours the more Shandong soldiers arrive and attempt to push into the heart of the city. Its a gamble that may or may not pay off."
