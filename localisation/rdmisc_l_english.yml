shandong.464.desc:0 "After the fall of the republic, a growth in leftist activity started in Shandong with small socialist clubs forming. One of those clubs was the Shandong Revolutionary Club in which promoted socialist nationalism and an ideology known as anti-Japaneseism. After the Qing's restoration the club was shutdown and its members under ground, as a result one of its members, Xi Zhongxun in 1933 forms the 8th Route Army with symbolic irony of the eight powers who humiliated China. Now since the collapse of the Qing, Xi has been able to gather more support and further strengthen his 8th Army. The main concern of the army is how it treats those of Japanese support or origin as the are is anti-japan in varying degrees.  Tho also brings about socialists policies that do appease the local population. In recent days Shandong intelligence hasn't heard a thing of their whereabouts. Now there is a concern that they have something big going underway."

As the red bandits draw closer the sounds of horse are heard as cavalry tear through the regiment based in Jinan. After a few hours the more Shandong soldiers arrive and attempt to push into the heart of the city. Its a gamble that may or may not pay off."

shandong.458.desc:0 "The May Fourth Movement rippled through post-Weltkrieg China like a wave, inciting youth across the nation to throw away the old and create new forms of Chinese culture. It disintegrated after the failure of Republican hopes, leaving little outside the field of literature and art to indicate it had ever existed. Yet a spark of May Fourth idealism remained in the province of Shandong, in the form of the Crescent Society: this movement has hidden away in the cities and the fields, spreading its beliefs of a broad, inclusive and democratic republicanism amongst the common folk.\n\nAlthough Hu Shih is by far the most influential of these theorists, Beijing politics and the chaos of the South has kept him away from the Society's activities. Instead, Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo and Tao Xingzhi have become grassroots leaders and have adapted the majority of the society's works since its 1923 founding to the unique conditions of the peasantry, with Xu in particular being hailed as the Genius of the People's Poems for his ability to sculpt compelling and heart wrenching ballads.\n\n As the Shandong government grows ever more corrupt and bloated, the Society has mobilized young adults and sympathetic townsmen in Jinan to demonstrate against the government. Time will tell what becomes of this movement…"
shandong.459.desc:0 "Jinan burns with the acrid smell of gunpowder and echoes with the shouts of war, yet troops from the South are nowhere near the city center: the cauldron of public dissent has boiled over into the bubble and ferment of revolt. Following an attempted arrest of Crescent Society leadership in a theater on the outskirts of the city, irregular militias have sprung up like weeds to defend the Society and destroy the government. All attempts to halt them have failed, at the cost of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of lives at impromptu barricades.\n\n Explosions rip through the city center, with the estate that served as Zhang Zongchang's base of operations and the Temple of Zhang Tianran both lying in ruins. While sporadic clashes take place across the city, it is clear that Xu Zhimo and his fellow Crescent Society members are the only effective leadership left in Jinan - and by extension, the sole holders of Shandong Province. "
shandong.460.desc:0 "The Crescent Moon Society has triumphed over its enemies, but as the debris is cleared in Jinan a new question arises: whose agenda shall the Society follow once in power? Since its foundation, Crescent Moon's leadership has attempted to follow a unified agenda of progressive and democratic activism - but now that the literary society is secure in power, calls for free elections and a formed government grow ever louder in intensity from the rural cadres.\n\n If Hu Shih’s engagements in Beijing had succeeded, this procedure would be a settled matter, but alas, he has written privately to request a stay of absence. Xu Zhimo, the poet, stands as his strongest ally and a firm supporter of the poetry-education model of political mobilization. However, rising up to challenge the model of vernacular literature is Tao Xingzhi: a staunch educator whose name literally means ‘knowledge action’, he envisions his rural colleges as a means to true and progressive democracy. Facing them both is Wen Yiduo, a self-avowed radical who now aims to rip apart the “dead water” that characterizes rural Chinese culture - his support base is found mostly in the unlanded and oppressed underclasses of rural Shandong, and some have accused him of outright cultish behavior amongst the masses. \n\n In a closely fought election process, the Society chooses Shandong’s future - and perhaps that of the whole of China."
shandong.461.desc:0 "Wen Yiduo has led many lives - once a student and an American immigrant, he became a nationalist and a zealous poet, and now he has ascended to the leadership of Shandong. A communique from the Kuomintang's Central Committee now offers Wen the chance to take another step towards national prominence.\n\nThe offer is simple: take up a position as a local governor in addition to being appointed to a senior position in Nationalist social leadership. With the backing of Nationalist armies, the argument goes, it will be easier to accomplish the Society's stated goals of advancing social reform. However, the issue has unexpectedly polarized Shandong's elite society - some have also argued that the Kuomintang have no real interest in pursuing Wen's stated goals and that their annexation is a thin front for territorial gains. As both pro-annexation and anti-annexation crowds rush to Jin'an to argue their cause, Wen must make the most important decision of his career."
shandong.462.desc:0 "While the Society's long-time rivals and radical opponents have long protested the existence of China's landlord class, we are not blind to the long-term effects of landlordism in the rural villages that now constitute our power base. It seems that there is no end to the complaints of rural landlords extorting tenants for money, power and sexual favors, and the sons of these rural gentry seem just as determined to undermine our progressive social policy. In an incendiary letter of protest published under anonymous pretences, one village has even alleged that their landlord has personally sold their land under false pretence to a Western mining prospect - with not a cent going to the tenants! \n\n A wave of popular fury has created an unprecedented opportunity for us: Xu Zhimo and Tao Xingzhi have proposed a collaborative plan to institute land buybacks and rent caps for the landlord-afflicted villages, forcing landlords to surrender their domains and shifting them to urban areas. Wen Yiduo proposes more radical options still, with full-on land-reform accompanied by rural committees who will re-distribute lands by force with assistance from Society cadres. Of course, the option to do nothing remains… but it might not be a choice the Society can easily live with."
shandong.466.desc:0 "As the fog and ashes of violence settle, as the blood of both innocent lives and of the guiltiest dries, Shandong finds itself in the position to decide who will lead them. The leadership of the 8th Route army is varied, but there are three main leaders: Xi Zhongxun, Deng Enming, and Zhang Chunqiao. Xi, a man who’s suffered countless setbacks, has finally reached a position where he can see himself leading his people with only one more push. A self-proclaimed ‘National Marxist,’’ he seeks to adapt the principles of Marxism to the context of the Han Chinese, and no one else, “For too long have we, the true inheritors of China, been silenced!” As such, he is staunchly against Japanese in China. Xi has respect for many others, such as Deng Xiaoping, as his economic policies closely match his. Deng Enming takes his hate for Japan one step further, calling for the ‘ultimate destruction’ of Japan, a leader of the Anti-Japanese movement. Deng also calls for the economy to be solely in the control of the Chinese people, while others may only participate within it, a sort of protectionism. Finally, there is Zhang Chunqiao, a man inspired by none other than Mao Zedong, the Hunan revolutionary. Zhang is very involved with the League of Left-Wing Writers, being a writer and journalist himself. He aims to unite China into a Revolutionary Republic and, like his peers in the 8th Route army, carries an anti-Japanese message, albeit it is the most diluted of the three."
shandong.467.desc:0 "As part of the new policies in Shandong, many influential Japanese people, and even some off the street, are being arrested. Of greater interest, an influential Japanese diplomat has been arrested, which is sure to anger the Empire, but the current administration does not care. If the detainment of a single diplomat scared our government, our message would be worthless. Anyways, the diplomat is being held in an unknown prison somewhere in Shandong. What will happen to the Japanese in China is yet to be seen, but it seems like nothing good will happen if we are to follow the words of the 8th Route Army ideologues. "
shandong.468.desc:0 "In a deeply unsurprising move, the government of Japan is calling for the immediate release and repatriation of the journalist arrested in Shandong. How we react to this may decide the fate of many lives in China, but at the same time will be core in the continuation of the freeing of China from both western and eastern imperialism. If we decide to free the diplomat, we may avoid sanctions or, at the absolute worst, an excuse to invade China for the Japanese. On the other hand, if we decide to keep the diplomat detained, the workers of our country will surely feel reassured and as so we may gain their trust. Additionally, our plan to transform China will continue smoothly, and we will be sending a message to the rest of the world that we are not privy to their demands."
rd_shandong_favor.1.desc:0 "It seems every student in China knows the name of Lu Xun, for better or worse: the acclaimed author has spearheaded much of the May Fourth Movement’s questioning of society, and his beloved Ah Q series remains a favorite for popular reformers and laymen’s households alike. But those under the tutelage of the Crescent Moon Society know the truth: that Lu Xun, far from leading China to progress, has damned it instead! \n\n His ideas claim to be radical and progressive, but in truth they offer no substance or vision for the people to rely on. They merely criticize and reflect, aping the insecure tendencies of the modernist and ambiguous protagonists he writes about - indeed, Diary of a Madman is so vague and effusive in its programme it seems to have been written by a madman himself!\n\n Our leadership has officially pronounced these works to be anathema to all true Chinese, and students have enthusiastically burnt his books and letters at the nudging of Society cadres. We will be free to dream new and better dreams when we cast this outmoded failure aside…"
rd_shandong_favor.2.desc:0 "Tao Xingzhi has long been an admirer of the Hunanese Communist theorist, Mao Zedong - despite the latter's relative obscurity outside China, Mao's rhetoric has influenced senior CSP members and his report on Hunanese peasant rebellion was a major inspiration for the Society's initial rebellion and revolutionary movement. Even as Tao has continued his work with civic and rural colleges in Shandong, he has kept up a stream of correspondence with Mao himself. A few weeks ago, Tao began the journey across inner China's vast spaces to meet this great theorist in person.\n\n With journalists in attendance, Tao offered a donation for Mao's Provincial School and his activities within the Party. The pair discussed China's potential for democracy and socialism, and Tao expressed interest in Mao's New Democracy model for bringing together the divided social strata of Chinese society under a single government. Over a series of visits, the two also visited rural schools and made assessments of the problems and opportunities of China's budding rural school system.\n\n The visit concluded with the pair exchanging classical Chinese poems celebrating their friendship, and Tao has returned to Shandong full of ideas for the Society's rural work. It appears the Great People's Educator has been refreshed by this trip - and a steady stream from Hunanese schools suggests Mao has been similarly impressed as well."
rd_shandong_favor.3.desc:0 "The people have rightfully taken to the streets today in a demonstration against Japanese Imperialism across China, but mostly in Shandong. The demonstrations, however, have quickly devolved into full out brawls between our own countrymen against each other and against whatever Japanese they can find. In a beautiful showcase, though, some Japanese Anti-Imperialists have joined ranks with them, fighting against the Imperialists in a very limited capacity. It seems that China is slowly being united in the mission to fight against Japanese Imperialism. Further, Japanese power is beginning to be threatened by these protests, with different, mostly negative reactions from Japanese politicians and other leaders."
rd_shandong_favor.4.desc:0 "Following recent changes in policy, and compounded by the mounting unrest and unity against Japanese power in China, several high-ranking members of government have ratified a plan through which this may be furthered. For now, Japanese businesses face a great predicament, and not solely a legal one. The people in several big cities, and even in smaller towns, have taken to the streets to attack Japanese owned businesses. Onlookers have described the attacks as not particularly vicious, but very spirited. ‘They smashed through their windows, they didn’t take much, but they broke many things and made the owners run,’ said an anonymous onlooker. In response to this, the government has decided to follow through the people’s vision and outright ban the Japanese from owning any businesses. As an effect of this, many Japanese businesses are either abandoned or under new, Chinese, ownership. The long-term effects of these happenings are yet to be seen."
rd_shandong_favor.5.desc:0 "The streets are passionately rife with words, drama, and action, people are being humiliated left and right, their past exposed and their future compromised. This all stems from the recent surge in struggle sessions around the country. In particular, many of these struggle sessions are concentrated against the Japanese expatriates in China, which tend to nearly always be infiltrated with reactionary thought.  The international community is calling for us to do something to stop these “excesses,” but they do not realize how necessary this is if we want to change the culture in China. It is important to note that only through correction can something stop, and being a reactionary is something that is absolutely impermissible in the society of today. Many fear for the future, will this evolve into something more?"
rd_shandong_favor.6.desc:0 "As the rhetoric of the Shandong Government has escalated in viciousness and intensity, the people responded to it by embracing their long-held bitter grudges and unleashing a torrent of anger on the Japanese who have enslaved China. Now, the violence has reached a crescendo as the government has officially announced a ‘month of redemption’ for the Japanese population: in this month, no violent activities, up to and including murder and theft, will be penalized if they are to be conducted against Japanese nationals. \n\n The public, as ever, has responded with aplomb. The few cowering bandits of Wa have been thrown into the streets by radicalized members of the public, thrashed within an inch of their worthless lives, and their bodies cut up for public display on street lamps and public stages. In places where the Japanese have fled, mobs have taken to assaulting people even remotely associated with the Japanese Empire, going so far as to murder merchants selling Japanese rice and courtesans who have slept with Japanese sailors! Can we really stand back and do nothing as order dissolves in our cities? Is this not a bridge too far for the promotion of our righteous revenge?"
shandong.457.desc:0 "The currents of turbulence sweep the province of Shandong, and in its ruralities a confluence of religious associations, pseudo-cults and movements sweep the traditional heart of China. One of the most prominent of these is the Guiyidao, roughly translating to the Way of the Return to the One. This sect follows a range of teachings which can charitably be described as eclectic, with influences from the Xiantiandao strain of millenarianism to Christianity and even esoteric Buddhist traditions. Despite the vacuous ideologies of the Society, or perhaps precisely because of it, the role of the Society has only grown in these times of war. \n\n As warlords, intellectuals and students wage a brutal war on the streets of Shandong's cities, the Societies' two great leaders meet in a shadowy hall. Xiong Xiling, old President of the Republic, and Xiong Shili, major Confucian revivalist, know that the status quo cannot long remain: if the Society wishes to influence the currents of Chinese history, they must act soon. Plans are made, buildings scouted, assembled militias given firearms. \n\n In the dark of a cold Shandong night, the Society acts, and Jin'an burns with the fires of war. A hastily-assembled coup seizes buildings, destroys rival militias, and burns the city's main street down to block enemy forces from reconsolidating. As the smoke clears, the coup forces wait anxiously for news that they have decapitated the leadership -"
shandong.470.desc:0 "The Red Swastikas have emerged victorious, shedding their status as a social pariah and rising to the very center of the province's leadership. Yeti within the halls of the Society all is not well: the tensions between Xiong Shili and Xiong Xiling have risen to the fore, for the agendas of Republican, Buddhist nationalism and esotericist Confucian revival have come into inescapable conflict. Xiling's demands for greater autonomy to fully develop the Chinese Republican movement and secularize the Society sit poorly with a sizable fraction of the Society, and Shili is determined to expel what he now sees as an existential threat to the very ethos of the Society itself. \n\n It is a stifling night in Jin'an, and the two factions edge ever closer to all-out conflict in the streets. A confrontation in the headquarters of the Society now forces the matter to a closed election: Shili calls for a vote of no confidence amongst the ranks of the Society's closest leadership, which if passed will ensure that Xiling is expelled and Shili takes his place. As the night simmers, the Society votes for its future - and perhaps the future of all of the Mainland, too."
shandong.471.desc:0 "Xiong Shili has consolidated his Society's position at the heart of China, and the charity halls of the people resound with joy at the mention of the Red Swastika and Guiyidao faith. Indeed, some have called Xiong the Great Revivalist for his work stirring the spirit at the heart of China. Yet some remain discontent with the Confucian idealism at the heart of the Society's beliefs. It would surprise many in the Society's upper ranks that Xiong himself would count among their number - but it is true nonetheless. Xiong has come to doubt some of the confidence exuded even by members like himself in the so-called immortal tenets of Confucianism - families lie in ruin, society struggles to find meaning outside of the workplace, the family grows ever more brittle. A solution is needed, and it cannot be found in the books of the Analects or Classics. \n\n The solution comes in a letter sent by a mysterious man by the name of Nicholas Roerich. The development of esoteric socialism."

technocratic_china_flavor.9.desc:0 "It is a dark night, and in a crowded Shanghai building hundreds of breaths are held as a scarlet curtain rises. A curmudgeonly old man walks to the stage with his daughter in tow, snapping at each other in popular-theater conventions: the crowd rises and begins applauding. It is the twentieth run of Thunderstorm, the greatest play Shanghai has known this century, and the theater is so packed it barely has standing room. This is the fruit of Technocratic policy, and, some whisper, of a new age of Chinese modern theatre.\n\n Indeed, much has changed in Shanghai's local theater scene: riding off unofficial government endorsement, popular plays teaching "red messages'' have swept the city by storm. Tian Han and Cao Yu, two unlikely collaborators, have ridden this wave to promote their new and developing interpretations of Chinese modern theater: merging the customs of classical theater and their biting satire of social customs and modernity, Tian and Cao have now produced a litany of plays calling for explicit social reform and condemning the traditional family's patriarchal and capitalist dominance. They have enjoyed massive support from the population, and indeed have founded independent schools developing ‘local theater’ for the enjoyment and edification of provinces outside Shanghai. \n\n The spectacular successes of these playwrights and theater troupes have been praised even by literary figures in distant Beijing and Guangzhou, and local governments are reportedly struggling to handle a new wave of social criticism inspired by the plays' messages. It appears the Technocrats will inspire shifts in Chinese culture that will rock the foundation of all of the nation, and perhaps, one day, all of the world."
technocratic_china_flavor.10.desc:0 "The renowned writer Ernest Hemingway has had something of an explosive career, albeit a deeply controversial one: from his publication of The Sun also Rises, an unapologetically condemnatory piece about the moral and social failures of the 1920s, to his marriage with Pauline Pffeifer (a one-time mistress), Hemingway has dominated international headlines with his outsized lifestyle and taciturn nature. His most recent move, however, has shocked international observers a final time: Hemingway has decided to stay in Shanghai and write of the new Government’s social reforms there. \n\n Hemingway was invited at the behest of the new government, and despite his nebulous ideological leanings he has taken a shine to the new regime's determined stance against imperialism and warlordism. From the regime's long struggle against outlying warlords and bandits Hemingway has fashioned the material for his next project, a work he has titled A Farewell to Arms."
technocratic_china_flavor.11.desc:0 "Noted film star, composer and leftist media figure Charlie Chaplin has fled the chaos and instability of America for wider, peaceful shores: yet international audiences are stunned to discover that he has landed not on the islands of Hawaii or the fields of England or France, but in China's Shanghai Government. Chaplin stepped off his plane this morning to enraptured crowds, who almost mobbed him with joyful questions, and only a hastily-dispatched security detail was able to move him to government quarters. He was welcomed with a formal speech from representatives of the Technocratic regime, who appealed to Chaplin to begin "a great international dialogue to bring joy and cheer to the peoples of China and the world". \n\n While worries have clouded the reputation of the Technocratic government, many now celebrate the public commitment of the regime to bring culture and modern media to the peoples of the city - and the government has pledged funds to begin airing simplified Chinese versions of Chaplin's famous movie, Modern Times, to help radicalize the working classes of China's teeming cities against capitalist-colonial intrusion. Chaplin's stay is reportedly also helping him gather material for a biography of Zhang Zongchang, a film he has reportedly titled - The Basest Dictator."
technocratic_china_flavor.12.desc:0 "Shanghai's new Technocratic regime took one step out towards the world today as it welcomed a delegation of Russia's technocratic minds: what has been termed the Technocratic Internationalist Movement met in an unofficial capacity in Shanghai's former hotels to discuss the future of the world and the development of Shanghai's brand of socialism. Delegates representing not just Russia and China, but a range of nations and pan-national socialist movements pledged to pursue an agenda of scientific and centrally guided approaches to socialism in a widely publicized meeting, culminating with pledges for scientific and administrative collaboration in a variety of fields. \n\n However, it is also clear the Soviets have pursued a slightly different approach to Technocracy than the Chinese: representatives of Alexei Gastev himself noted that Russia's unique national conditions ultimately justified the unique Proletkult ideology developed to promote a scientific understanding and full utilization of proletarian labor for socialist construction, and called on Chinese leadership to develop their own brand of political innovation to respond to the anti-imperialist and modernizing demands of China's working class. Whatever the future holds, it appears, the Soviet and Shanghai governments will march into the future as separate but equal banners of technocracy."
technocratic_china_flavor.13.desc:0 "The Shanghai Government has long dealt with accusations of a moral and ideological vacuum at its center: some say they have long lost the means of how to achieve socialism, yet preserve it as a goal. To dispel these rumors and to put a concrete agenda forward for the cadres of the administration, today Mao Dun himself has promoted a new and expanded vision for his government and for China: Social Futurism. \n\n Developing off the theories of thinkers like Mayakovsky and Goncharova in Russia, Mao Dun calls for a Sinified Social Futurism able to promote the common goal of a progressive and scientifically developed society under the trusteeship of a common party. Mao specifically calls for a distinct agenda merging China's progressive literati and intellectual traditions, and the industrialist ideals of Social Futurism as practiced in Russia and Europe, to spearhead a holistic development of both culture and industry. \n\n Mao's manifesto has been met with widespread acclaim by municipal authorities, and a new campaign to promote the full integration of artists, writers, and the progressive movement of industrial culture has already begun in force. It seems Mao's vision may yet bring light to Shanghai, and perhaps one day the rest of the nation, too."
technocratic_china_flavor.14.desc:0 "The technocratic leadership now in power in Shanghai has seldom made mention of the circumstances of its origin, and indeed it has seldom had the opportunity to clarify matters. A statement today formally establishes the Technocratic leadership as fully distinct from the League of Left Wing Writers - the Shanghai government now calls for a full ideological break with the League's initial ideals of political progressivism and literary-inspired cultural reform, calling them idealistic and a risk to the survival of Chinese socialism in their current form. \n\n The League's membership have not stayed silent either, with senior members condemning this as a form of suppression of an ideological alternative. Nevertheless, the Shanghai government has continued with its iconoclastic policy, officially ceasing the publications of the League's journals and newsletters. It appears the dream of the League's founders, to build a literary elite capable of bringing China to full and vital life, will be realized by people who thoroughly reject their vision."
