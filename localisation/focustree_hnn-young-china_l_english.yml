No matter what the political system is, it must be governed by the law before it can be implemented and maintained. If the rule of law is not established, it will inevitably lead to private rule. It is not enough as a lesson. If private governance is prevalent, the country will never be able to get on the right track. Second, regarding the relationship between the state and individual rights.
