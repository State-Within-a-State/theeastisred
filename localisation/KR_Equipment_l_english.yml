AUS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942.

BAT_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The Sturmpanzerwagen A7V is a German tank which was used extensively during the Weltkrieg, and is often seen depicted in works of art celebrating the German victory over the Entente. While its design has since become obsolete and Germany has come to use newer, more complicated tank designs, many of the vehicles were given as aid to Germany's allies and puppet states, where they remained in service for years to come."

BAT_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Kätzchen is a light tank armed only with two light machine guns. Design of the Kätzchen began in 1932, originally with the purpose of creating a standard training tank, but short before mass production began in 1934, its role and design was revised and then the tank was adopted by the Army for combat."

BAT_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Ozelot"
BAT_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Ozelot, while based upon the chassis of the Kätzchen, is drastically different from its predecessor. Feature much heavier armaments, armour, engine, and an entirely revamped transmission system, the Ozelot, while it can certainly go toe to toe with comparable vehicles, was originally designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were to be developed, but the vehicles capable performance secured it a place in the German war machine."

CRO_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942.

During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."

The KP/-41 itself began as a derivative of Lahti's own 'Suomi' submachine gun rechambered for his new cartridge, and indeed, while retention of the general shape and feel of the KP/-31 was prefered, ultimately, the new design's massive recoil impetus led to both further external changes to the weapon's body as well as a reduction in its cyclic rate."

FOP_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "In response to an aggressive Argentinean armament program, Chile adopted a modified Mauser 1893 (commonly known as the Spanish Mauser) chambered in 7x57mm Mauser, and contracted the German company DWM (Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken) for more than 100,000 rifles and carbines on the pattern. The Chilean Mauser 1895 has earned a reputation for reliability under even the harshest conditions, one which it maintains decades after its adoption. It it mainly with these Chilean Mausers that the revolutionary government in Patagonia is equipped."

FOP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Shortly before the Weltkrieg, Chile contracted the Austrian arms manufacturer Steyr for a new Carbine variant of the German Mauser 1898 chambered in 7x57mm like older Chilean rifles. Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter. A few months after its initial production, the rifles began to trickle into Patagonia."

HUN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

HUN_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

HUN_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

NIC_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Krag–Jørgensen rifle was adopted by the United States in 1892 to replace the aging Springfield Model 1884. While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."

To alleviate these problems, in 1934, it began an ambitious effort to retrofit and convert its Krag rifles to carbines chambered in 7.5×54mm French, which had successfully been smuggled into the country in large quantities."

Unlike its predecessors, however, the MAS-40/42 was found to be exceptionally reliable in French military testing. The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine. A small number of MAS-40/42 rifles were smuggled into Nicaragua along with production tooling specifications."

SLO_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

SLO_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

SLO_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

SVK_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mannlicher vz. 95"
SVK_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

SVK_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

SVK_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

SVK_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The development of a portable automatic rifle using an intermediate cartridge was born in the Monarchy thanks to the success of the Király series of "heavy" submachine guns and the realisation that combat ranges were far shorter than anticipated. Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

The deployment of these conversions helped cement the concept of armoured transports in Austrian doctrine."

TRS_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mannlicher M.95"
TRS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."
TRS_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Mannlicher-FÉG Karabiner M.24"
TRS_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Kar M.24"
TRS_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

TRS_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

TRS_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "MKar M.44"
TRS_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The development of a portable automatic rifle using an intermediate cartridge was born in the Monarchy thanks to the success of the Király series of "heavy" submachine guns and the realisation that combat ranges were far shorter than anticipated. Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."
