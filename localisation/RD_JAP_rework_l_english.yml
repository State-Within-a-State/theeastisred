japan_new_event.0.title:0 "The Sun Rises - On Shaky Grounds"
japan_new_event.0.desc:0 "In 1919, Japan signed a peace treaty with "honor," allowing the country to retain its pre-war colonial territories while returning the acquired territories to the Germans. However, this peace would be marred by national and colonial instability.\n\nStarting in 1918, the nation began to experience major economic deterioration due to the ongoing war, leading to the 'Rice Riots.' These riots were a result of increasing inflation, rising prices overall, the Weltkrieg, and Japanese involvement in Siberia. This economic turmoil caused the resignation of Terauchi Masatake, prompted by massive unrest, including violent riots and strikes. In response, the military initiated a crackdown.\n\nFollowing Terauchi's resignation, Hara Takashi assumed leadership but was assassinated by a right-wing radical at Tokyo station in 1921. The motives behind the assassination stemmed from Hara's corruption with the Zaibatsu and his promotion of universal suffrage. Takahashi Korekiyo was appointed as the next Prime Minister but also resigned, citing a lack of support within the Seiyukai.\n\nHis replacement, Katō Tomosaburō, died in office and was succeeded by Yamamoto Gonnohyōe."

japan_new_event.1.title:0 "The Sun Rises - the Land Shakes in Terror"
japan_new_event.1.desc:0 "A week after the formation of Yamamoto Gonnohyōe's cabinet, a major earthquake struck the city of Kanto in 1923, measuring between 7.9 and 8.2 on the scale. In the aftermath, anarchists, seeking to replicate a revolution like that in France, attempted to cause an uprising in Japan in 1923. The uprising was brutally crushed by the army. Following this, Namba Daisuke attempted to assassinate Prince Regent Hirohito on December 27 of the same year.\n\nAs a result, Gonnohyoe and his cabinet resigned, and martial law was imposed. In the aftermath, new violence against Korean minorities began due to a false rumor spread by radical rightists. In response, the army and police were called in to "protect the minorities" while also using the opportunity to arrest and attack socialists, further cracking down on the Japanese Communist Party, and other Japanese socialist groups. With the understanding from the Genro, Army Minister General Tanaka Giichi, also the leader of the Choshu faction within the Imperial Japanese Army, was appointed as Prime Minister to stabilize the country.\n\nHis appointment divided the Imperial Diet sharply, particularly the former ruling party Rikken Seiyukai. The quarrel between the supporters and opponents of the Tanaka cabinet resulted in splitting the party into two, with the supporters of Tanaka forming the Seiyuhonto. In the general election of 1925, the Seiyuhonto effectively performed as the ruling party, and with the opposition in disarray, the Tanaka regime was able to force the Peace Preservation Law, which enabled the state to impose the death penalty on those who attempted to harm the 'National Polity.' The law symbolized the draconian rule of Tanaka.\n\nHowever, with the British Revolution of 1925, the German dominance over the European market, and the continued economic decline in America, Japan's export-led economy continued to free fall with no end in sight. In early 1926, a scandal over the so-called 'earthquake bills' and the Bank of Taiwan broke out, causing a series of massive bank closures. On the diplomatic front, Tanaka's indecisive policies failed to secure Japanese interests in China from the advancing Nationalists or from German intervention. The weakness of his rule was exposed."

japan_new_event.2.title:0 "The Sun Rises - Stability At Last?"
japan_new_event.2.desc:0 "In April 1926, the two main opposition parties, the Rikken Seiyukai, and the Kenseikai, formed a coalition and initiated the '2nd Movement to Protect the Constitution.' Faced with popular support for the opposition and Prince Regent's indirect intervention, Tanaka and his cabinet were forced to resign. In an event later called the 'Constitutional Restoration of 1926,' the Rikken Seiyukai and the Kenseikai formed the 'Constitutionalist Coalition' cabinet, promising democratic governance, universal suffrage, and a party-based cabinet.\n\nHowever, the coalition soon broke down over the policy in China. The Seiyukai called for an 'active policy' and favored intervention in China to support Zhang Zuolin, aiming to prevent complete German domination of China. Meanwhile, the Kenseikai was ready to accept the new order in China, seeking recognition of Japanese economic interests and even considering the possibility of isolating the German position through collaboration with the new Chinese state.\n\nWith the collapse of the Constitutionalist Coalition, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi approached the Seiyuhonto, eventually merging the two parties into one again. Japanese troops were quickly deployed across the South Manchurian Railway Zone to deter the Germans and their allies from entering Manchuria. Diplomatic pressures from Berlin prevented active Japanese intervention in the war, but the expedition solidified Japan's position in Manchuria and secured Zhang's power base, eventually leading to the formation of the Anguojun Government.\n\nThe chaotic year of 1926 ended with the death of Emperor Taisho. His son, Hirohito, assumed the throne with the era name of Showa. Over the next nine years, the Inukai cabinet oversaw mild economic recovery through interventionist policies and achieved peaceful political developments. However, hardship still persisted in the countryside, and extremism was growing. By 1936, Japan was poised to extend its empire, with Germany's dominance in the world appearing to be in decline. Japanese ambitions looked towards both the remaining Qing Chinese territories and the German Pacific possessions. However, before pursuing these goals, the country had to overcome its internal strife and unrest."

Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA.\n\nKatayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party). After the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements.\n\nYesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."

japan_new_event.4.desc:0 "The history of the left in Japan begins shortly after the Meiji Restoration with the founding of the Oriental Socialist Party in 1882 by Tokichi Tarui. Advocating an ideology akin to Utopian Socialism, the party was forcefully dissolved by Japanese authorities just one month after its establishment. Two decades later, Japan's official socialist party emerged in 1902, founded by Sen Katayama, Isoo Abe, Naoe Kinoshita, Shusui Kotoku, Kiyoshi Kawakami, and Kojiro Nishikawa, the majority of whom were Christians. However, this party, too, faced a ban within two days of its creation.\n\nIn 1906, the first Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) was founded, only to be banned within a year under the Security Police Law. From then until 1918, the Japanese left remained dormant but gradually expanded within certain aspects of society as the nation further industrialized. During the Great Weltkrieg, many Japanese socialists advocated for peace but were silenced one way or another.\n\nIn 1912, a significant workers' union in Japan, called the Yuaikai, was founded by Bunji Suzuki. Throughout the Great Weltkrieg, it leaned more towards socialism, with some elements supporting syndicalism. The October Revolution in 1918 and the impact of the rice riots caused by soaring inflation and poverty led to a brief revival of the Japanese left. This revival was marked by the formation of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) in 1920, initially in secret, with hopes of going into exile in the USSR. However, the defeat of Lenin's revolution dashed their hopes, leading them to opt for exile in syndicalist France. Some JCP members embraced syndicalism, while others remained loyal to their communist ideologies."

japan_new_event.5.desc:0 "As a result of the rice riots and the emergence of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), socialism in Japan experienced a revival, albeit briefly. By 1923, the Kanto earthquake struck, leading to another crackdown. Following 1926, new socialist parties emerged along the lines of the Japan Trade Union Federation, resulting in the founding of three parties: the Farmer Labor Party, the Labor Peasant Party, and the Japan Peasant Party. These parties aligned with agrarian syndicalism but were swiftly disbanded after government crackdowns and internal splits.\n\nIn the same year, Katayama Sen and Abe Isoo formed the Social Masses Party (Shakai Taishuto), a party claiming to be Social Democratic but incorporating some radical factions from members who originated from the dissolved syndicalist parties. Sen Katayama served as a unifying force to prevent conflicts between moderates (led by Abe Isoo) and radicals (led by Kenzo Yamamoto). Additionally, fringe factions like the national socialists, led by Inejiro Asanuma, may have connections to exiled totalists in Europe.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the three Syndicalist Parties, some radicals formed a guerrilla army within the rural and urban areas of Japan known as the Japanese Red Army. Led by Sanzo Nosaka, this force became a troublesome entity for Japanese police and military officials, carrying out assassinations on politicians and business figures. As of 1936, the Shakai Taishuto is under surveillance by the Kempeitai due to its radical undertones but still maintains a sizable amount of popularity."

As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base in cities and began expanding into the countryside, aiming to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. However, it faced a split in 1930 from radical members Adachi Kenzo and Seigo Nakano, leading to the creation of the Kokumin Domei (National Alliance). This new party advocates for a statist economy and promotes Showa Statism.\n\nA new, third player entered the scene in the general election of 1936: the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933.\n\nThe stage is now set to determine if the Seiyukai has retained enough seats to maintain an absolute majority..."

They also support the status quo in terms of colonialism but advocate for better treatment of colonial subjects and the impoverished. On the other hand, the radicals, led by Kenzo Yamamoto, seek more radical reforms, including the abolishment of the Zaibatsu.

Give equal rights between men and women regarding marriage and divorce.\n3. Equal rights of educational institutions and work for women and the residents in Japan to Japanese men.\n4. Guarantee an equal minimum wage, regardless of sex or ethnicity.\n5. Equal pay for equal work among men, women, and the residents in Japan.\n6. Provide female working mothers with a room and one thirty minute-recess every three hours for feeding.\n7. Ban the firing of women on account of marriage, pregnancy, or childbirth status.\n8. Abolish licensed prostitution.\n\nThis program has been met with praise and wariness, as some notice its similarities to her initial manifesto made in the 20's. Though back then her proposal was dissmised by the JCP it is looked upon more favourably. Though this leads to the choice between who shall lead the KWL, in which Kenzo for some weird reason tied it with running the foreign ministry following a series of scandals concerning Ikuo Oyama.
