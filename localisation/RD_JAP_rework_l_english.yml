japan_new_event.0.desc:0 "In 1919, Japan signs a peace with "honor", in which allows the country to continue having its pre war colonial territories, whilst giving the territories it acquired to the Germans. But this peace would be mired in national & colonial instability. From 1918, the nation started to go into major economic deterioration per the on going war, causing the 'Rice Riots', in which were a result of increasing inflation, increasing prices all round, the weltkrieg and Japanese involvement in Siberia. This would cause the resignation of Terauchi Masatake, as per massive unrest such as , violent riots and strikes. This would lead to a crackdown by the military. Following this, Hara Takashi would take over, but would be assassinated by a rightwing radical at Tokyo station in 1921 for reasons stemming from Hara's corruption with the Zaibatsu and promoting universal sufferage. Takahashi Korekiyo would be appointed the next Prime Minister but would also resign, citing a lack of support from with in the Seiyukai. His replacement, Katō Tomosaburō would die in officer. And be replaced by Yamamoto Gonnohyōe."

japan_new_event.1.desc:0 "A week after the formation of Yamamoto Gonnohyōe's cabinet, a major earthquake strikes the city of Kanto (in 1923) , measuring at a scale of 7.9-8.2. In the aftermath, anarchists, seeking to replicate a revolution like France, attempt to cause an uprising in Japan in 1923. This uprising would be brutally crushed by the army. Following this Namba Daisuke attempted to assassinate Prince Regent Hirohito on 27 December that same year. Gonnohyoe and his cabinet resign and martial law is then imposed. Though also in the aftermath new violence against Korean minorities began due to a false rumor (spread by radical rightists), due to this unrest the army and police were called in to "protect the minorities" whilst also using this opportunity to arrest and attack socialists, and further crackdown on the Japanese Communist Party and other Japanese socialist groups. With understanding from the Genro, Army Minister General Tanaka Giichi, also the leader of the Choshu faction within the Imperial Japanese Army, was appointed as Prime Minister to stabilize the country. His appointment divided the Imperial Diet sharply, particularly the former ruling party Rikken Seiyukai. The quarrel between the supporters and the opponents of the Tanaka cabinet resulted in splitting the party into two, with the supporters of Tanaka forming the Seiyuhonto.  In the general election of 1925, the Seiyuhonto effectively performed as the ruling party, and with the opposition in disarray, the Tanaka regime was able to force the Peace Preservation Law, which enabled the state to impose the death penalty on those who attempted to harm the 'National Polity'. The law symbolized the draconian rule of Tanaka. However, with the British Revolution of 1925, the German dominance over the European market, and the continued economic decline in America, Japan's export-led economy continued free fall with no end in sight. In early 1926, a scandal over the so-called 'earthquake bills' and the Bank of Taiwan broke out, causing a series of massive bank closures. On the diplomatic front, Tanaka's indecisive policies failed to secure Japanese interests in China from the advancing Nationalists nor from the German intervention. The weakness of his rule was exposed."

japan_new_event.2.title:0 "The Sun Rises - Stability At Last?"
japan_new_event.2.desc:0 "In April 1926, the two main opposition parties, the Rikken Seiyukai, and the Kenseikai formed a coalition and started the '2nd Movement to Protect the Constitution'. Facing popular support for the opposition and the Prince Regent's indirect intervention, Tanaka and his cabinet was forced to resign. In an event later called the 'Constitutional Restoration of 1926', the Rikken Seiyukai and the Kenseikai formed the 'Constitutionalist coalition' cabinet, with promises of democratic governance, universal suffrage, and a party-based cabinet. However, the coalition soon broke down over the policy in China. The Seiyukai called for 'active policy' and favored intervention in China in support of Zhang Zuolin with the goal of preventing the complete German domination of China, while the Kenseikai was ready to accept the new order in China in return for recognition of Japanese economic interests and even saw the possibility of isolating the German position through working with the new Chinese state. With the collapse of the Constitutionalist coalition, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi approached the Seiyuhonto, eventually merging the two parties into one again. The Japanese troops were quickly deployed across the South Manchurian Railway Zone to deter the Germans and their allies from entering Manchuria. Diplomatic pressures emanating from Berlin prevented active Japanese intervention in the war, but the expedition solidified Japan's position in Manchuria and secured Zhang's power base, eventually culminated in the formation of the Anguojun Government. The chaotic year of 1926 ended with the death of Emperor Taisho. His son Hirohito assumed the throne with the era name of Showa. In the next nine years, the Inukai cabinet presided over mild economic recovery through interventionist policies and achieved peaceful political developments, but hardship still persists in the countryside and extremism is growing. Japan in 1936 is poised to extend her empire, with Germany's dominance of the world appearing to be in decline the Japanese look greedily at both the remaining Qing Chinese territories and the German Pacific possessions, but first, the country must overcome its internal strife and unrest."

japan_new_event.3.desc:0 "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements.\n\nYesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."

japan_new_event.4.desc:0 "The history of the left starts just after the Meiji restoration, with the founding of the Oriental Socialist Party in 1882, founded by Tokichi Tarui. It advocated for an ideology akin to Utopian Socialism. It would be dissolved one month after its founding due to forceful dissolvement by Japanese authorities. 20 years later, Japan's official socialist party would be founded in 1902 by Sen Katayama, Isoo Abe,  Naoe Kinoshita , Shusui Kotoku , Kiyoshi Kawakami , and Kojiro Nishikawa(majority of which are christian). But yet again this party would end up being banned within two days of its creation. In 1906 the first JSP would be founded, yet again it would be banned within a year under the Security Police Law. from then onto 1918, the Japanese left remained doormant but was slowly expanding with in certain aspects of society as the nation further industrialized. During the Great Weltkrieg many Japanese socialists were advocating for peace but would be silenced one way or another. But in 1912, a new major workers union in Japan would be founded, called the Yuaikai, founded by Bunji Suzuki. Throughout the Great Weltkrieg it would become more socialist and some elements would support syndicalism. In 1918, the October revolution would begin, and a the Japanese left would see a brief revival. not to mention the impact of the rice riots caused by soring inflation and poverty. This revival would come from the formation of the Japanese communist party in 1920 in secret, though hoping to go to the USSR in exile. Their hopes were dashed by the defeat of Lenin's revolution, so they would opt into going into exile in syndicalist France. Some of the JCP members would become syndicalists, some would stay loyal to their communist ideologies."

japan_new_event.5.desc:0 "From the results of the rice riots and the JCP, socialism within Japan was revived, although for a short while as by 1923, the Kanto earthquake struck and another crackdown occurs. After 1926 new socialist parties formed on the lines of the Japan Trade Union Federation, in which 3 parties would be founded. The Farmer Labor Party, the Labor Peasant Party and the Japan Peasant Party, these parties would align with agrarian syndicalism, these parties would be disbanded quickly after government crackdown and splits. In that same year, Katayama Sen and Abe Isoo formed the Social Masses Party (Shakai Taishuto), a party that claims to be Social Democratic but has some radical factions from members that came from the dissolved syndicalist parties. Sen Katayama would lead the party as a uniting force that would prevent issues of the moderates (Lead by Abe Isoo) and radicals (Lead by Kenzo Yamamoto). With also fringe factions like the national socialists led by Inejiro Asanuma, who may have connections to the exiled totalists in Europe. After the dissolving of the 3 Syndicalist Parties, some of the radicals formed a guerilla army within the rural and urban confines of Japan. This is the Japanese Red Army. Led by Sanzo Nosaka, this force has become a troublesome force for Japanese police and military officials, with it carrying out assassinations on politicians and business figures. As per 1936, the Shakai Taishuto is under watch by the Kempeitai due to some of tis radical undertones but still remains a party with a sizable amount of popularity."

japan_new_event.7.desc:0 "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyukai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party).\n\nThe Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet, but would face a split in 1930 from radical members Adachi Kenzo & Seigo Nakano. This would lead to the creation of the Kokumin Domei (National Alliance), which advocates for a statist economy and also the party promotes Showa Statism . A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933.\n\nIt is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
japan_new_event.8.desc:0 "After the success of the Kokumin in the 1936 National Diet Elections, the time has come to select a candidate for Prime Minister. The two contenders are Seigo Nakano and Adachi Kenzo. Both advocate for a statist economy, but Nakano is more radical and is vocal about a Maximist type national-syndicalist state, due to his inspiration from European Totalists like Oswald Mosely and Benito Mussolini.  Adachi Kenzo, still promotes the statist idea but more attended to a less socialist sounding view, via a more corporatist economic model called Dirigisme."
japan_new_event.9.desc:0 "Ever since the founding of the Shakai-Taishuto the party has been seeing an influx of radicals from the 3 previously dissolved socialist parties in the late 20's. Now as they secure victory, both moderates and radicals grab for power to be Prime Minister. The moderates are led by Abe Isoo, who promote an anti syndicalist and also promote a status quo in terms of colonialism but also advocate for better treatment of colonial subjects and the poor. Whilst the radicals led by Kenzo Yamamoto who seek radical reforms like abolishment of the Zaibatsu and also a more peaceful foreign policy and great worker rights."
