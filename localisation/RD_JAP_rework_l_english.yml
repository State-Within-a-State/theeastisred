japan_new_event.0.desc:0 "In 1919, Japan signs a peace with "honor", in which allows the country to continue having its pre war colonial territories, whilst giving the territories it acquired to the Germans. But this peace would be mired in national & colonial instability. From 1918, the nation started to go into major economic deterioration per the on going war, causing the 'Rice Riots', in which were a result of increasing inflation, increasing prices all round, the weltkrieg and Japanese involvement in Siberia. This would cause the resignation of Terauchi Masatake, as per massive unrest such as , violent riots and strikes. This would lead to a crackdown by the military. Following this, Hara Takashi would take over, but would be assassinated by a rightwing radical at Tokyo station in 1921 for reasons stemming from Hara's corruption with the Zaibatsu and promoting universal sufferage. Takahashi Korekiyo would be appointed the next Prime Minister but would also resign, citing a lack of support from with in the Seiyukai. His replacement, Katō Tomosaburō would die in officer. And be replaced by Yamamoto Gonnohyōe."

japan_new_event.1.desc:0 "A week after the formation of Yamamoto Gonnohyōe's cabinet, a major earthquake strikes the city of Kanto (in 1923) , measuring at a scale of 7.9-8.2. In the aftermath, anarchists, seeking to replicate a revolution like France, attempt to cause an uprising in Japan in 1923. This uprising would be brutally crushed by the army. Following this Namba Daisuke attempted to assassinate Prince Regent Hirohito on 27 December that same year. Gonnohyoe and his cabinet resign and martial law is then imposed. Though also in the aftermath new violence against Korean minorities began due to a false rumor (spread by radical rightists), due to this unrest the army and police were called in to "protect the minorities" whilst also using this opportunity to arrest and attack socialists, and further crackdown on the Japanese Communist Party and other Japanese socialist groups. With understanding from the Genro, Army Minister General Tanaka Giichi, also the leader of the Choshu faction within the Imperial Japanese Army, was appointed as Prime Minister to stabilize the country. His appointment divided the Imperial Diet sharply, particularly the former ruling party Rikken Seiyukai. The quarrel between the supporters and the opponents of the Tanaka cabinet resulted in splitting the party into two, with the supporters of Tanaka forming the Seiyuhonto.  In the general election of 1925, the Seiyuhonto effectively performed as the ruling party, and with the opposition in disarray, the Tanaka regime was able to force the Peace Preservation Law, which enabled the state to impose the death penalty on those who attempted to harm the 'National Polity'. The law symbolized the draconian rule of Tanaka. However, with the British Revolution of 1925, the German dominance over the European market, and the continued economic decline in America, Japan's export-led economy continued free fall with no end in sight. In early 1926, a scandal over the so-called 'earthquake bills' and the Bank of Taiwan broke out, causing a series of massive bank closures. On the diplomatic front, Tanaka's indecisive policies failed to secure Japanese interests in China from the advancing Nationalists nor from the German intervention. The weakness of his rule was exposed."

japan_new_event.2.desc:0 "In April 1926, the two main opposition parties, the Rikken Seiyukai, and the Kenseikai formed a coalition and started the '2nd Movement to Protect the Constitution'. Facing popular support for the opposition and the Prince Regent's indirect intervention, Tanaka and his cabinet was forced to resign. In an event later called the 'Constitutional Restoration of 1926', the Rikken Seiyukai and the Kenseikai formed the 'Constitutionalist coalition' cabinet, with promises of democratic governance, universal suffrage, and a party-based cabinet. However, the coalition soon broke down over the policy in China. The Seiyukai called for 'active policy' and favored intervention in China in support of Zhang Zuolin with the goal of preventing the complete German domination of China, while the Kenseikai was ready to accept the new order in China in return for recognition of Japanese economic interests and even saw the possibility of isolating the German position through working with the new Chinese state. With the collapse of the Constitutionalist coalition, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi approached the Seiyuhonto, eventually merging the two parties into one again. The Japanese troops were quickly deployed across the South Manchurian Railway Zone to deter the Germans and their allies from entering Manchuria. Diplomatic pressures emanating from Berlin prevented active Japanese intervention in the war, but the expedition solidified Japan's position in Manchuria and secured Zhang's power base, eventually culminated in the formation of the Anguojun Government. The chaotic year of 1926 ended with the death of Emperor Taisho. His son Hirohito assumed the throne with the era name of Showa. In the next nine years, the Inukai cabinet presided over mild economic recovery through interventionist policies and achieved peaceful political developments, but hardship still persists in the countryside and extremism is growing. Japan in 1936 is poised to extend her empire, with Germany's dominance of the world appearing to be in decline the Japanese look greedily at both the remaining Qing Chinese territories and the German Pacific possessions, but first, the country must overcome its internal strife and unrest."
