### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Assuming the Chrysanthemum throne after the death of his father, Emperor Taishō, His Imperial Majesty represents a divine dynasty of nearly 2,500 years; his personage is seen not only as head of state, but as representative of the very heart, soul, and being of the nation. As both militarists and a resurgent left thrive amidst mounting domestic chaos, the Emperor remains silent, his role unclear and undecided. However, when and if the Emperor does make his move, it will no doubt be decisive."
POLITICS_ARAHATA_KANSON_DESC:0 "The first Chairman of the Japanese Union, Arahata Kanson, took office during the immediate change in the political landscape of the nation. Having been arrested in the Red Flag Incident, Arahata had to hide his pro-socialist tendencies, later creating a socialist underground for left-leaning activists. It is said Arahata might be responsible for all the radical left violence against the Imperial regime."

### Ideas ###

JAP_narrow_rail_desc:0 "Japan's railways were built using an unusually narrow gauge inherited from the British Empire during the Meiji Era. While it does make construction easier in Japan's mountainous terrain, its speed limitations have negatively impacted our industry. Experts argue over whether conversion is worth the government's time."

During wartime, we will have full control over labour supply, production of goods, financial interactions, industrial and labour organisations, as well as prices and the press. It has now been augmented by a compulsory military training. Originally added in 1925 by the Tanaka regime as a way to subdue growing anti-militarist influence, it discontinued with the Constitutional Restoration of 1926. It was time to reverse that decision."

JAP_land_reform_desc:0 "Land reform has been an ongoing issue in Japanese politics for nearly 70 years. We are not the first to attempt to resolve the issue and, if we are not careful, will not be the last. The more effort and time we put in, the more likely it is for our efforts to bear fruit, though we are free to declare an end to our programme at any time...\n\nCurrently our land reform progress is: [?JAP.JAP_land_reform_variable|H0]."

JAP_NSA_focus:0 "The National Security Act"
JAP_NSA_focus_desc:0 "A debate in the Diet regarding the national security act has been raging for the past few weeks, and it is time for us to decide which course our nation will take. Some conservative members of the Diet fear that if the act isn't passed, radical elements in society will try to seize power. The future of Japan is in our hands."
JAP_democratic_path:0 "Defend Democracy!"
JAP_democratic_path_desc:0 "After receiving the offer from the scheming army officers, General Hayashi Senjuro has refused to back their coup attempt, citing his responsibility to the established regime. With the trial of the May 15th incident behind us, it is now time to secure democracy in the eyes of the people."
JAP_imperialist_path:0 "The Longest Day"
JAP_imperialist_path_desc:0 "General Hayashi Senjuro has agreed to support the scheming army officers in their coup attempt. With support from the army minister, it seems like their attempt will be successful..."

### Focuses - Political - Democratic ###
JAP_elec_reform:0 "Electoral Reform"
JAP_elec_reform_desc:0 "After an extensive review of our voting system, several loopholes and oversights have been discovered. They allow significant amounts of voter fraud in general elections. By introducing a reform package to our electoral process, we can hopefully limit this phenomenon."
JAP_fem_reform:0 "Enact Women's Suffrage"
JAP_fem_reform_desc:0 "While feminist activity started in Japan back in the 19th century, they have only recently managed to achieve any progress by overthrowing the 'Police Security Act' in 1921. Recently, more liberal minded members of the Diet have been pushing to finally grant women full political rights as part of Japan's growing democratic traditions."
JAP_DEM_SCI:0 "Academic Pluralism"
JAP_DEM_SCI_desc:0 "Pluralism is a central part of any democracy. By encouraging pluralism in our academic institutions, we can improve our research and education!"
JAP_DEM_EDU:0 "Constitutional Education"
JAP_DEM_EDU_desc:0 "By introducing a new curriculum to the public-school system that includes democratic theory and principles, we will raise a new generation of Japanese youth who will enshrine the ideas of humanism and democracy."
JAP_DEM_CUL:0 "Cultural Golden Age"
JAP_DEM_CUL_desc:0 "The openness and enlightenment of our society have brought a golden age in culture, both traditional and modern. Ancient arts of theatre and poetry are flourishing, as well as new forms of entertainment such as films and animation. This reflects greatly on us abroad and strengthens Japanese values both in foreign and domestic markets."

### Focuses - Political - Centralism ###
JAP_chuou:0 "Military Centralism"
JAP_chuou_desc:0 "The Emperor has refused to support the government, and now a coup is certain. The question is no longer if, but when and who..."
#JAP_chuou_desc:0 "Faced with a possible coup from the Ishinha faction, the centralist leaders have approached the Imperial Court, hoping to gain the Emperor's favour. Without his support, the coup will most likely fail."
JAP_chuou_start:0 "A Political Blueprint"
JAP_chuou_start_desc:0 "After our assumption of power we are expected to draw out a national political plan reflecting our militarist ideology. In the following weeks, the supreme military council will be meeting to discuss such a document."
JAP_chuou_fund:0 "Fund Adjustment Ordinance"
JAP_chuou_fund_desc:0 "The Fund Adjustment Ordinance is the first of a series of 'National Defence Ordinances' decrees by the Centralist regime. The state-owned Bank of Japan is now empowered with the regulation of capital investments, the establishment of companies, and the subscription or underwriting of securities. This will allow the Government to control and allocate funds to war industries."
JAP_chuou_mob:0 "National Total Mobilisation Ordinance"
JAP_chuou_mob_desc:0 "The National Total Mobilisation Ordinance is designed to provide the Government a means to control and mobilise all the resources and manpower available in the Empire. During wartime, we will have full control over the labour supply, production of goods, financial institutions, industrial and labour organisations, as well as prices and the press."
JAP_chuou_cons:0 "Military Training Curriculum"
JAP_chuou_cons_desc:0 "Military training was first introduced into the compulsory physical education curriculum in 1925 by the Tanaka regime as a way to subdue growing anti-militarist influence and discontent among students. It was discontinued with the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but it is time to reverse that decision."
JAP_chuou_draft:0 "National Service Draft Ordinance"
JAP_chuou_draft_desc:0 "The National Service Draft Ordinance is new act which enables the Government to mobilise the labour force even in peace time, and additionally, it removes several barriers that delay such mobilisations. This new Ordinance will improve both our peace- and wartime output."
JAP_chuou_last:0 "One Corporate State"
JAP_chuou_last_desc:0 "The time has finally come to transform Japan into a unified and strong corporate state, where every individual does his part for the good of the Emperor and the Kokutai."

### Focuses - Political - Imperial ###
JAP_ishinha:0 "The Showa Restoration"
JAP_ishinha_desc:0 "After being left out of key governmental and administrative positions in the new Japanese government, the Restoration faction of the army is disgruntled, and is planning another coup. If they are to gain the support of the Emperor, they are likely to succeed."
JAP_yokuseiha:0 "Yokuseiha Faction"
JAP_yokuseiha_desc:0 "The Yokuseiha faction is comprised of ex-parliament members with restorationist tendencies. They resist the dictatorial plans set by Konoe for the Taisei Yokusankai and prefer a decentralised approach to restoration."
JAP_yokuseiha_POL:0 "Separation of Powers"
JAP_yokuseiha_POL_desc:0 "While supporting imperial restoration, the Yokuseiha members also see a problem with absolute power. Partly to prevent corruption, and partly to secure their power, they arrange a decentralised system for the Taisei Yokusankai."
JAP_yokuseiha_ECO:0 "A Free Market"
JAP_yokuseiha_ECO_desc:0 "Keeping in line with their decentralised approach, the Yokuseiha propose an economic plan consisting of minimal state intervention in the economy. While this would allow groups like the Zaibatsu to gain more power, this policy will also endear the regime to them."
JAP_yokuseiha_AGR:0 "Colonial Investments"
JAP_yokuseiha_AGR_desc:0 "In response to the agricultural crisis Japan faces, the Yokuseiha faction proposes a programme of settlement incentives in Japanese mainland colonies in China and elsewhere. By increasing agricultural input from abroad, the homeland economy could shift its focus to other sectors and supply logistics would be improved."
JAP_kodoha:0 "Kodoha Faction"
JAP_kodoha_desc:0 "The Kodoha faction is made up of restorationist army generals and officers who wish to bring Japan back to its folkish roots and create a strong imperial power at the head of the state."
JAP_kodoha_POL:0 "Imperial Power"
JAP_kodoha_POL_desc:0 "The Kodoha faction resists Konoe's efforts in creating a separate dictatorial power from the imperial court and instead wish to transfer ultimate power to the emperor in a form of absolutism where the Taisei Yokusankai is a subject of the emperor."
JAP_kodoha_ECO:0 "Nationalisation"
JAP_kodoha_ECO_desc:0 "The Kodoha faction's economic plan involves nationalisation of the economy for a dedicated empire-oriented production. By establishing an institution for government control such nationalisation can begin."
JAP_kodoha_AGR:0 "Intensify Land Use"
JAP_kodoha_AGR_desc:0 "The revolutionary part of the Kodoha faction believe that we can make more out of the land we have. By adjusting agriculture and production techniques, and throwing away the traditional land designations, we will improve the density of our industry."
JAP_kakushinha:0 "Kakushinha Faction"
JAP_kakushinha_desc:0 "The Kakushinha, or reform faction, is led by prince Konoe and is mainly comprised of intellectuals and politicians. They aim for a reconstruction of the Japanese political system with an absolute Taisei Yokusankai at the core of Japanese society."
JAP_kakushinha_POL:0 "A New System"
JAP_kakushinha_POL_desc:0 "The political plan of the Kakushinha faction was to create a single centralised political body which will combine the executive, legislative and administrative powers of the Japanese empire. Despite heavy resistance, the reformists' domination of the first convention allowed them to pull through with the reforms."
JAP_kakushinha_ECO:0 "Bureaucratic Regulation"
JAP_kakushinha_ECO_desc:0 "The Kakushinha faction's economic policy involves creating a bureaucratic system to regulate the economy as part of the Taisei Yokusankai."

JAP_small_rail:0 "Narrow-gauge Railways"
JAP_small_rail_desc:0 "Our narrow-gauge railways had their advantages during construction, but now they hold back our burgeoning industry. The future waits for no-one, least of all Japan."
JAP_rapid_industrialisation:0 "Rapid Arms Expansion"
JAP_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "While our economy is growing, and we avoided much of the fallout of Black Monday, our arms productions still isn't what it has the potential to be. By building factories designed specifically for such purposes, we will be able to greatly expand our arms production."
JAP_need_oil:0 "Prioritise Military Oil"
JAP_need_oil_desc:0 "With the country at war, oil is more vital than ever. While it is useful for many civilian purposes, it is vital for our armed forces. As such, we must prioritise oil for military uses first and foremost."
JAP_land_reform_focus:0 "Land Reform"
JAP_land_reform_focus_desc:0 "Land use is highly inefficient in Japan. Nearly all the factions agree that something must be done, though what exactly prompts much disagreement. Nevertheless, if we are to realise our full economic might, we must solve this issue."

### Focuses - Economic - Zaibatsu ###
JAP_ZAI_ECO:0 "Support the Zaibatsu"
JAP_ZAI_ECO_desc:0 "Over the past several decades the Zaibatsu have increased their political and economic power to a staggering degree. It would be in our best interest to cooperate with them."
JAP_ZAI_FAC:0 "Zaibatsu Factory Construction"
JAP_ZAI_FAC_desc:0 "Some Zaibatsu have requested for the state to aid them in building factories throughout the home islands. This would create many jobs and help resolve the economic crisis."
JAP_ZAI_TRAIN:0 "Zaibatsu Central Railroad"
JAP_ZAI_TRAIN_desc:0 "The Central Railroad Plan, a series of new and modernised train lines in the home islands, has been at the forefront of our continued push towards an efficient and productive society. However it has been delayed for years now, lacking both funding and expertise. Luckily however, the Zaibatsu are able to provide both and so, with their backing, the project can finally be completed."
JAP_ZAI_RAW:0 "Zaibatsu Resource Projects"
JAP_ZAI_RAW_desc:0 "Various Zaibatsu have approached us with raw resource prospects requesting us to fund them. Our funding should give access to much needed rare resources."
JAP_ZAI_SCI:0 "Zaibatsu Technological Research"
JAP_ZAI_SCI_desc:0 "State funds would go a long way to ensuring that skilled Zaibatsu scientists have everything they need to push Japan forward into the future and should give the government greater control over research priorities."

### Focuses - Economic - Nationalisation ###
JAP_NAT_ECO:0 "Nationalisation Policy"
JAP_NAT_ECO_desc:0 "For too long, the Zaibatsu and foreign imperialists have deceived and exploited our people for their personal profit. Let us take control of the economy and nationalise the industry for the good of all of Japan!"
JAP_NAT_ZAI:0 "Nationalise The Zaibatsu"
JAP_NAT_ZAI_desc:0 "Since the Meiji Restoration and subsequent westernisation the Zaibatsu have been the heart of economic and industrial activity within Japan. They hold great influence over domestic and foreign policy. The Imperial Army has always opposed the Zaibatsu's influence and worked toward their liquidation. Now that they effectively control the country, the Army can nationalise all major Zaibatsu and destroy their influence."
JAP_NAT_AIR:0 "Nationalise the Aircraft Industry"
JAP_NAT_AIR_desc:0 "The aircraft industry is a vital part of national defence and is thus too important to be left in private hands. All military aircraft manufacturers must be nationalised and reformed into arsenals or merged into military controlled factories."
JAP_NAT_IND:0 "Nationalise Heavy Industry"
JAP_NAT_IND_desc:0 "After the breakup and nationalisation of the Zaibatsu, we control most of the heavy industry in the country - but not all. Some companies are below Zaibatsu level in prominence but still major firms. To achieve total state control, it will be necessary to nationalise them."

### Focuses - Economic - Bureaucratic ###
JAP_BUR_ECO_1:0 "Bureaucratic Economy"
JAP_BUR_ECO_1_desc:0 "The government decided to reform the economy to be regulated by a bureaucratic structure. It is designed to limit the Zaibatsu's power and increase benefits for the state."
JAP_BUR_CAR_1:0 "Integration of Foreign Motor Companies"
JAP_BUR_CAR_1_desc:0 "The Japanese auto market has always been dominated by American car makers, causing a deep trade deficit. When the Second American Civil War broke out many American companies and knock-down plants in Japan lost contact with their parent companies, giving MITI bureaucrats a prime opportunity to assimilate those factories. Even when the Second American Civil War ends, it will be decades before they will be able to compete again."
JAP_BUR_CAR_2:0 "Regulating the Automotive Industry"
JAP_BUR_CAR_2_desc:0 "Throughout the 1920's and 1930's, Japanese domestic automotive production was too small to compete globally. To remedy this and enable domestic firms to compete with much bigger Western counterparts, we can force a merger of our many small automotive firms into a few big businesses."
JAP_BUR_RESOURCES:0 "Reorganise Resource Extraction"
JAP_BUR_RESOURCES_desc:0 "With tensions rising all over the world, it is vital for our resource extraction to happen effectively and quickly. To achieve this, firms involved in resource extraction will be subjected to greater bureaucratic supervision and forced to undergo a structural reorganisation under the government's guidance."
JAP_BUR_TRAIN:0 "The Shinkansen Proposal"
JAP_BUR_TRAIN_desc:0 "It is time to enact the Shinkansen proposal: create a connect set of high speed railways then combine them with new steam and electric locomotives. These lines would be able to carry passengers and freight at speeds never seen before."

### Focuses - Economic - Colonisation ###
JAP_INT_KOREA:0 "Chosen Modernisation"
JAP_INT_KOREA_desc:0 "It may be best not to outright own Chosen but rather rule it as a puppet nation. Through modernising their economy they will become a more useful ally and our economy would surely benefit."
JAP_COL_START:0 "Colonial Incentives"
JAP_COL_START_desc:0 "In order to save our dying agrarian sector and further expand our economy we sorely need to invest in colonial projects. The Empire is Japan's future."
JAP_COL_KOREA:0 "Chosen Integration"
JAP_COL_KOREA_desc:0 "The closest colony to the Home Islands, Chosen has long been the aim of economic and cultural assimilation efforts. These are not complete however, and with additional funding and expanded Japanese settlement it will be possible to fully integrate Chosen."
JAP_COL_TAIWAN:0 "Taiwan Integration"
JAP_COL_TAIWAN_desc:0 "Taiwan, the richest and most prosperous colony in the Empire, promises limitless bounty to those that settle there. Long our model colony, it is time to put the final funding in to fully integrate Taiwan into our Empire."
JAP_COL_PORT:0 "Kwantung Integration"
JAP_COL_PORT_desc:0 "Although the Kwantung Leased Territory was only officially granted to Japan for a period of 99 years, the city of Dairen and its surroundings make an excellent destination for Japanese settlers. The Government has every reason to provide further incentives, increasing emigration."
JAP_colonise_hawaii:0 "Hawaiian Integration"
JAP_colonise_hawaii_desc:0 "Japanese-Hawaiians make up a large portion of the population of that island chain, and as a result Japanese is already a common language in schools and homes. It should be a relatively smooth transition to ensure that the upper classes are Japanese too and thereby turn the place into proper prefectures."

### Focuses - Military - Base ###
JAP_MIL_start:0 "Jakuniku Kyoshoku"
JAP_MIL_start_desc:0 "Jakuniku Kyoshoku or 'Survival of the Fittest' is a fundamental understanding in our military philosophy; the Western imperialists have greatly expanded their air forces and navies and if we do not do the same we will surely fall victim to their forces."
JAP_MIL_army_start:0 "Army Direction"
JAP_MIL_army_start_desc:0 "After years of bickering, it is time to make a choice as to the Imperial Army's direction. Strategic planners from Imperial General Headquarters present four promising options.\n\n§YChoosing which army theorem we want to implement will greatly affect the content of our focus tree.§!"
JAP_MIL_naval_start:0 "Results of Second Maru Keikaku"
JAP_MIL_naval_start_desc:0 "We can't just focus on our army, our navy needs reforming as well."

### Focuses - Military - Army Selection ###
JAP_MIL_AIR:0 "Air-Land Supremacy"
JAP_MIL_AIR_desc:0 "Our army needs to be like a tsunami: it must crush our enemies with an unstoppable advance, and we will obtain this result by achieving cooperation between the army and the air force. If this reform will prove itself successful, we will be able to rain hell on our enemies."
JAP_MIL_WILL:0 "Supremacy of Will"
JAP_MIL_WILL_desc:0 "The Japanese people must seek to embody \"Yamato-Damashii\", the \"Spirit of Old Japan\", as wars are won by tenacity and the willingness of the Japanese soldier to die for the Emperor and Kokutai. In 1905 the Imperial Army lost nearly one hundred thousand soldiers to the Russians in Manchuria, and yet claimed victory nonetheless. Once again his Imperial Majesty calls upon Japan's noble sons to fight!"
JAP_MIL_MASS:0 "Numerical Supremacy"
JAP_MIL_MASS_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg clearly showed us one thing: numbers win wars. Although our industrial capacity can’t match that of Germany, we can create cheaper equipment in order to match their numbers. Its quality might not be excellent, but in the end, having cheap equipment is better than having no equipment at all."
JAP_MIL_TECH:0 "Supremacy of Mind"
JAP_MIL_TECH_desc:0 "Traditionally our military has focused on winning wars through numbers or sheer determination; in reality Japan's greatest victories have come through being more advanced than her opponents. Nowadays however we cannot rely on buying western equipment first, so if we wish to retain our advantage over our enemies we mush embrace technological supremacy to win the wars of tomorrow."

### Focuses - Military - Army Selection - Descriptions ###
JAP_army_mob_description_air:0 "The ‘Aerial Exterminating Action’, in which enemy aircraft are located and destroyed before they can even strike, will be formalized as a part of IJAAS doctrine. With the opposition burning in their own airfields, or ruined shortly after take off, our own supporting aircraft will have free reign of the air."
JAP_army_mob_description_will:0 "To ensure victory we must have our soldiers press forward, past our enemies defences into the heart of their operations. Achieving such a feat will rout the enemy in quick order and bring victory! Tenno Heika Banzai!"
JAP_army_mob_description_mass:0 "What we need now is speed, something faster than normal leg infantry. The high command is pushing for us to invest in trucks transporting troops. However, our industrial capacity is still limited, so in some cases we will need to improvise and adopt other methods. One method could be using bicycles, that will temporarily replace trucks until we will be able to fully mechanize our army."
JAP_army_mob_description_tech:0 "Speed is crucial to winning modern battles, whether that comes in the form of redeployments or exploiting breakthroughs. We must foster the expansion of motorised IJA units in order to bring such advances to Japan."
JAP_army_mob_description_default:0 "The cavalry charges of the Weltkrieg were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and rapidly integrates to mobile warfare tactics. We must shake off outdated thinking and use motorisation to speed up our offensives and reinforcements."

JAP_army_tank_description_air:0 "Our infantrymen, despite being the most skilled in the world, are still without protection against machine guns. In order to solve that, we shall allocate more funds for the research and development of a new weapon: armoured vehicles called tanks. These steel monsters are capable of having high defensive and offensive capabilities, and they will help our infantry forces rule the Asian ground."
JAP_army_tank_description_will:0 "By including armour and motorized infantry in our breakthrough forces we gain the ability to deal devastating damage in our assaults. We have become an unstoppable force and there is no immovable object."
JAP_army_tank_description_mass:0 "Tanks are massive beasts made out of steel that can crush everything they will face, but they have a problem, a massive one: they are incredibly expensive to produce. If we want to be able to use them, we will need to cut corners wherever possible, otherwise we won’t be able to produce enough of them to win any war. This might affect their reliability, but we need numbers."
JAP_army_tank_description_tech:0 "While some would argue that given our likely enemies and the terrain of Asia and the Pacific, tanks are a costly white elephant, the reality is that these new vehicles have the potential to transform warfare, and we must ride the crest of this wave."
JAP_army_tank_description_default:0 "Tanks are the pinnacle of modern warfare. Mobile vehicles armed with cannons worthy of artillery, and impervious to the average rifle. Even if we only produce few, we will plough through our enemies with judicious use of those steel behemoths."

JAP_army_sup_description_air:0 "Radio will play an important role in our reform plan: by achieving instant communication, our land forces will be able to tell the air force where to focus their bombing efforts. In this way, our enemies won’t stand a chance to the combined might of the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Army Air Service. "
JAP_army_sup_description_will:0 "Imperial soldiers must be prepared to fight everywhere to secure the peace and prosperity of the Japanese Empire; we shall require that every soldier must be prepared to fight and win in every condition they may find themselves in."
JAP_army_sup_description_mass:0 "Numbers are the key to victory, and that means also preserving them. We will need the help of the Nippon Sekijūjisha, the Japanese Red Cross Society, which has helped the Imperial Japanese Army both in the Russo-Japanese war and in the Weltkrieg in assisting wounded soldiers. Due to how huge the number of soldiers in the field is, they require more equipment than we currently have, even if that means using second-hand materials to provide them with what they need."
JAP_army_sup_description_tech:0 "Given the varied terrain we will be fighting in, combined with the often lacking infrastructure in Asia, the creation of a specialised engineer corps would be a great boon to our armed forces. We will put funds towards just such a unit."
JAP_army_sup_description_default:0 "Despite the increasing possibilities of aerial and naval warfare, ground combat is still key in tomorrow's wars. With preparation, we can avoid reliving the hell of the trenches."

JAP_army_specop_description_air:0 "Like a Katana shattering a diamond in thousands of pieces, our special forces, the elite of the Japanese Infantry, can destroy every enemy it will face. They’ll be modernized alongside the rest of the army by receiving improved weaponry and improved training, and they will be able to strike not only from the land and from the sea, but also from the sky."
JAP_army_specop_description_will:0 "Elite soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army will train high in the mountains across our mighty Empire, giving them the ability to fight better across hostile and perilous terrain and thus ensuring their victory wherever we may fight."
JAP_army_specop_description_mass:0 "The Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai, or Rikusentai for short, are infantry units of the Imperial Japanese Navy specialized in naval landings. Considering we will have to fight in China, which has a massive coastline, in the Insulindian archipelago and in the Pacific islands, we will need to expand their recruitment base and improve their training facilities if we want to maintain the naval supremacy we currently have in East Asia."
JAP_army_specop_description_tech:0 "While history often remembers the armies which win the most sudden or surprising victories, it is the army with the ability to win continually which ultimately triumphs. The IJA must focus on reliability in order to be capable of triumphing over any foe."
JAP_army_specop_description_default:0 "Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield. However, some situations are so hostile that they need specially trained men. Mountain ranges, amphibious landings, airborne assaults."

JAP_army_landdoc_description_air:0 "If we want to continue to rule the Asian ground, we need to modernize our way of thinking: we will mostly fight in places with low infrastructure, so we need to found a way where our army will be able to defend itself better while also fighting in a place with low supplies."
JAP_army_landdoc_description_will:0 "The modern Japanese curriculum, designed to counter Russian aggression on the plains of Manchuria, emphasises morale factors, tenacity of will and stressing training designed to develop the ability to recognise opportunities for decisive attack by enveloping open enemy flanks, encircling formations, and thus destroying even numerically and technologically superior forces."
JAP_army_landdoc_description_mass:0 "In East Asia, there are two things nobody has besides us: automatic weapons and good infrastructure. Thus, we have decided that grand assaults will be enough to win land battles, but we will need to pay attention to not have our army being in situations when they will be short on supplies, otherwise we might find ourselves in difficult situations."
JAP_army_landdoc_description_tech:0 "While strategy has traditionally focused on the study of past conflicts, we should always remember that these examples were so important because they were novel. We must remind our commanders that they are not trying to redo the past, but tread new paths."
JAP_army_landdoc_description_default:0 "The Weltkrieg, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense."

JAP_army_airdoc_discription_air:0 "Unlike land warfare, air warfare is almost entirely a novelty – and that means we need to build our air doctrines from zero, and solve the problem about how we can fly with night or rain. If we achieve this, however, we will make sure our air force are never gonna give our army up, and never gonna let it down."
JAP_army_airdoc_discription_will:0 "Japanese fighter pilot training is one of the most difficult in the world, but it is that way for a very good reason. Our planes are fast, our ground crews skilled, and our commanders smart, but nothing is more important than the courage and talent of the individual pilots."
JAP_army_airdoc_discription_mass:0 "Wars are won on the ground, not in the air, and as such we must totally subordinate the IJAAS to our ground units. Infantry officers in the field will take priority in directing air support, and will no longer be shackled to the slow-moving whims of higher command."
JAP_army_airdoc_discription_tech:0 "The lands we must patrol are vast, likely far from any airfields. Rather than looking at any specific air tactics, we must instead focus on ensuring that our planes can actually reach anywhere they are needed, to assist our operations whenever necessary."
JAP_army_airdoc_discription_default:0 "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the air force is capable of dealing damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."

JAP_army_inf_description_air:0 "On the western front of the Weltkrieg, the French taught everyone an important lesson: you need camouflage uniforms, otherwise the enemy is going to spot you easily. By allocating more funds to research and development of new types of infantry guns and uniforms, enemy bombers will have more difficulty spotting our land forces."
JAP_army_inf_description_will:0 "Our forces often display \"Gaman\" or \"fortitude and endurance in the face of adversity\" in the face of overwhelming odds. Where defeat seems like the only option, they refuse to surrender or back down and will snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. The Imperial Japanese Army is a force of will, of the people, of the state, and of the Emperor."
JAP_army_inf_description_mass:0 "The islands of Japan suffers significantly from a lack of important war materials causing a severe shortage of almost every type of equipment for our men. It has been proposed by some that perhaps using subpar materials in unimportant aspects of weapon design will allow our manufacturing industry to meet our demand."
JAP_army_inf_description_tech:0 "When Japan modernised herself, she quickly learned that having better equipment than her enemies was a major ace in combat. Now that we are a modern nation ourselves, we must preserve our weaponry advantage at all costs to retain this edge in combat."
JAP_army_inf_description_default:0 "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on a post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."

JAP_army_big_description_air:0 "Coloured shell tracers will be a key point in reforming our army: by differentiating different types of shells with different colours, our air force will be able to execute support manoeuvres, be it ground support or air superiority, which will help turn our army into an unstoppable force that can’t be matched by anything on Earth."
JAP_army_big_description_will:0 "While there is great glory to be had in dying for the Emperor, there is an even greater glory in winning for the Emperor. With overwhelming firepower, enemy positions can be turned to dust."
JAP_army_big_description_mass:0 "Just like our rifles, our artillery needs to be produced en masse, and the Osaka Army Arsenal, the oldest arsenal in Japan, approached us with a new design that will help us to streamline its production. This design, however, has some flaws with the reloading system, but as long as we can mass produce it, it will be fine."
JAP_army_big_description_tech:0 "Artillery is one of the great deciders of combat, with the side able to hit their targets with the greatest range and accuracy being almost unstoppable. We will use this advantage to keep our enemies hiding in their holes, as our gunners tune their range."
JAP_army_big_description_default:0 "Artillery is deeply important to our army. It enables us to bombard the enemy from afar, whilst keeping our soldiers supported in battle."

JAP_army_fighter_description_air:0 "Currently, our air force is small and inexperienced, and we need to do something about this, considering the key role it has in our reform plan. We need to have more and better fighters, and better training facilities for our pilots, so our army will annihilate every enemy it will face."
JAP_army_fighter_description_will:0 "Controlling the air means controlling the world! We must keep our fighters up to date to maintain our air superiority."
JAP_army_fighter_description_mass:0 "Currently, more than one designer produces our fighters causing a wide variety of models of the same type of plane. By issuing an act that forces all the manufacturers to standardize their planes based on an uniform design, we will make sure the production will be streamlined, and our fighters will be ready to be mass produced. It’s said that this design is unreliable, but those voices will quickly go away after some testing."
JAP_army_fighter_description_tech:0 "As the field of aerial combat evolves, it is obvious to many that fighters designed for different combat notions are not fit for the purpose. We will therefore begin creating aircraft which have adapted and evolved for changing tactics."
JAP_army_fighter_description_default:0 "The dogfights of the Weltkrieg were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."

JAP_army_bomb_description_air:0 "Our bombers will need to destroy the enemy’s supply lines, and the high command came up with an interesting idea: considering that most cities and infrastructures in Asia are made out of wood, using fire bombs for our bombers would be extremely effective. Some may consider it inhuman or excessive, but we will do what needs to be done to destroy both the western imperialists and the syndicalists."
JAP_army_bomb_description_will:0 "Japanese air power should be feared, and few are as feared as our bomber pilots. With the most modern planes at our disposal, no nation or army can withstand us."
JAP_army_bomb_description_mass:0 "Just like our fighters, our bombers vary wildly in their designs. We will issue an act similar to what we did to our fighter aircraft forcing a standardization of designs. There may also be reliability issues, but surely our enemies won’t notice, especially when they see thousands of bombers over their heads ready to drop bombs."
JAP_army_bomb_description_tech:0 "Current bomber aircraft are outdated and slow, but proponents of aerial bombardment argue that designing new bombers could finally allow them to achieve their dream of beating an enemy without ever sending ground forces against them."
JAP_army_bomb_description_default:0 "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Weltkrieg fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run."

### Events ###

japdom.1.t:0 "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
japdom.1.d:0 "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', the 1920s were marked by economic depression and political instability in Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector and caused a massive demographic change, as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market, and further driving down wages.\n\nAfter leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his cabinet successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment have fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."
japdom.1.a:0 "Gaman shiyou."

japdom.2.t:0 "Dissolution of the Diet"
japdom.2.d:0 "The four-year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called for a general election to happen as soon as possible."
japdom.2.a:0 "Very well."

japdom.3.t:0 "General Election 1936"
japdom.3.d:0 "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyukai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party).\n\nThe Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933.\n\nIt is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
japdom.3.a:0 "The Seiyukai have defended their absolute majority!"
japdom.3.b:0 "The Seiyukai have lost their absolute majority!"

japdom.4.t:0 "The Assassination of Katayama Sen"
japdom.4.d:0 "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements.\n\nYesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."
japdom.4.a:0 "This will be bad..."

japdom.5.t:0 "Friction Within the Japanese Left"
japdom.5.d:0 "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the "white terror", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirokei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party, at the expense of the moderate Shaminkei, (Social Democratic Clique) but also from outside the party, notably from the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sodomei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon, an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirokei accused the Sodomei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sodomei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirokei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirokei's members were expelled from both the Sodomei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."
japdom.5.a:0 "An interesting development."

japdom.6.t:0 "The May 15th Incident"
japdom.6.d:0 "The Prime Minister has been assassinated! Radical officers connected to the Nichirokei broke into his official residence and shot Prime Minister Inukai. They claim they did so to avenge the death of Katayama Sen and the murder of workers in Niigata. The incident has greatly shocked the nation, and the Admiralty Board, mortified by the incident, has already begun a court martial and a deep investigation into radical activities within the Navy."
japdom.6.a:0 "Appoint Suzuki Kisaburo to replace Inukai."

japdom.7.t:0 "Restorationists and Centralists"
japdom.7.d:0 "The 'Ishinha', restoration faction is a political ideology promoted by radical junior officers, characterised by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered to be the evil influence of favouritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor, and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them are the 'Chuushinha', the central faction, who are close to the central military leadership who support cooperation with the establishment, and the militarisation of politics."
japdom.7.a:0 "This will be trouble..."

japdom.8.t:0 "The Security Debate"
japdom.8.d:0 "The debate in the Imperial Diet has steadily increased the last few months, and is now reaching a terrifying level. Many members fear for their lives, and so, progress isn't just a matter of political power or personal pride, but of survival. There is a growing consensus that the current security laws aren't enough to protect democracy and that more are needed. The May 15th Incident must not be allowed to happen again."
japdom.8.a:0 "A comprehensive law, an act, must be made!"

japdom.9.t:0 "The National Security Act"
japdom.9.d:0 "The notorious Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime amidst the red scare following the Kanto anarchist uprising in September 1923, and a syndicalist assassination attempt on then-Crown Prince Hirohito in December of the same year. The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburo now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition, even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favour of the Act."
japdom.9.a:0 "We must defend our Democracy by any means necessary; the Act is forced through."
japdom.9.b:0 "Public opinion and the opposition defeat the Act."

japdom.10.t:0 "The Trial of the May 15th Incident"
japdom.10.d:0 "The court martial of the eleven murderers of Prime Minister Inukai began last month. Before the end of their trial a petition arrived at court, containing over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers around the country, pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata, asking that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sending eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to convince the court to accelerate the process, and although the death sentences were issued just yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today."
japdom.10.a:0 "This country is going crazy..."

japdom.11.t:0 "The Assassination of Suzuki Kisaburo"
japdom.11.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened again! Prime Minister Suzuki and his brother-in-law Hatoyama Ichiro were attending a party rally in Kawagoe today. When Hatoyama stood up to deliver his speech, a syndicalist terrorist from the 'Saitama Youth Volunteer Corps for National Salvation', shot Suzuki and Hatoyama in retaliation for the execution of Prime Minister Inukai's assassins. Suzuki's wound has proven fatal."
japdom.11.a:0 "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

japdom.12.t:0 "Government under Fire"
japdom.12.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the failure to pass the National Security Act has created a backlash against the Prime Minister. The conservatives and bureaucrats who had backed the bill feel betrayed by Suzuki's back-down. The House of Peers and the Privy Council, disappointed by the Government's inability to produce any measures against syndicalism, have lost all their patience with the cabinet."
japdom.12.a:0 "Suzuki's days are numbered..."

japdom.13.t:0 "Resignation of Suzuki Kisaburo"
japdom.13.d:0 "Abandoned by everyone, the humiliated Prime Minister resigned when the Peers passed a censure motion denouncing the cabinet and, with lukewarm support, former Home Minister Mizuno Rentaro was appointed in his place. Ominously, the Privy Council and its ultraconservative chairman Baron Hiranuma released a statement declaring that the 'parliamentary impotency' needs to be replaced by a more stable system."
japdom.13.a:0 "Call emergency convention!"

japdom.14.t:0 "The Election of Mizuno Rentaro"
japdom.14.dead:0 "The death of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyukai and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejiro (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyu Honto during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of their leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, though he has stopped short of crowning himself chairman, and appointed current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentaro instead."

japdom.15.t:0 "Japan's Longest Winter"
japdom.15.d:0 "The Japanese government has found itself effectively paralyzed. The downfall of two successive Seiyukai Prime Ministers has severely weakened the power of the new Prime Minister, and Hiranuma's open scheme to destroy the parliamentary system has only worsened the political turmoil. Extremist groups are growing by the day, and the military is getting more and more frustrated. Several high-ranking officers within the Army have hatched a plot to overthrow the civilian administration and 'rescue' the Empire.

japdom.16.t:0 "Japan's Longest Day"
japdom.16.d:0 "After ten years of political disgrace, the army has taken power again, this time by a coup d'état. Ultraconservative politician Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro is now Prime Minister, and a state of martial law has been enacted across all of the Greater Japanese Empire."
japdom.16.a:0 "Banzai!"

japdom.17.t:0 "Failed Coup Attempt"
japdom.17.d:0 "Even through the Army Minister refused to support the coup, he made no effort to stop the plot. The plotters interpreted this as a signal of permission, and proceeded. This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the surprise of the plotters, the Emperor resisted the coup d'état and issued an imperial command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly caught, while some took their own lives before they could be arrested."
japdom.17.a:0 "Democracy has prevailed!"

japdom.18.t:0 "The Power Struggle"
japdom.18.d:0 "Restorationist officers were the main participants of the coup that overthrew the elected government, for they saw the parliamentary system as a plutocratic capitalist institution. Under the successive government however, the Centralists took the leading role in the new regime and the Restorationists were marginalised from the leadership. The Restorationist leadership has concluded that they were deceived. A new power struggle has begun."
japdom.18.a:0 "Will this ever end?"

japdom.19.t:0 "The Ishinha Counter-Coup"
japdom.19.d:0 "Earlier today, Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. In the afternoon, the emperor himself addressed the soldiers announcing his official support of their revolution."
japdom.19.a:0 "The coup is successful!"

japdom.20.t:0 "Restorationist Coup Attempt!"
japdom.20.d:0 "Earlier today Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. After the emperor explicitly denounced the putschists the navy mobilised marine divisions to rescue the palace, and by the evening the coup was crushed."
japdom.20.a:0 "Thank god for the navy!"

japdom.21.t:0 "The Centralists Win!"
japdom.21.d:0 "The Restorationist coup has been defeated. Branded traitors, the Restorationists are being purged all over the country. There are calls for the Army to assume a greater role in government to help root out both the traitors and the syndicalists."
japdom.21.a:0 "Army Minister Hayashi will assume the premiership."
japdom.21.b:0 "There is no need for this right now."

japdom.22.t:0 "The Government of National Unity"
japdom.22.d:0 "Nakajima Chikuhei from the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo from the Minseito, both supporters of the National Security Act, have issued a joint statement, urging both the mainstream parties to form a multi-party 'Government of National Unity' to protect the Kokutai (national polity) from the syndicalist threat."
japdom.22.a:0 "We need a strong government."
japdom.22.b:0 "We don't need your nonsense; an election is what we need!"

japdom.23.t:0 "On the Basic Principles of National Defence"
japdom.23.d:0 "After taking power, the Centralists sought a political blueprint for their new regime. They have presented such a blueprint, titled 'On the Basic Principles of National Defence' and have distributed it among the Centralist leadership. Envisioning an 'Advanced National Defence State' (Kodo Kokubo Kokka), the document proposes to transform the state into one geared and ready for total war. To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line."
japdom.23.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.24.t:0 "On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure"
japdom.24.d:0 "'On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure' is a 156 page pamphlet produced by the Ministry of Education to establish an official description of the 'Kokutai', or national structure (It can also can be translated as 'national essence', 'national polity', etc). The pamphlet officially enshrines the Emperor as a living god, according to the legend of the Goddess Amaterasu and 'an unbroken line of emperors' (Banseiikkei). To serve the divine Emperor, his subjects were required to cast themselves aside for the social harmony (Wa) and for the prosperity of Japanese culture. To some extent, the pamphlet is a response to criticism of the Centralist's 'Neo-Shogunism'."
japdom.24.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.25.t:0 "The New System Movement"
japdom.25.d:0 "To mobilise support for the regime and its reform programme, the 'New System Movement' (Shintaisei Undo) has been organised. Led by Prince Konoe Fumimaro, the movement aims for the creation of a political institution that is capable of merging and binding people into the organic whole of the nation - basically a Japanese breed of corporatism, with the Emperor at its head. The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one party- the Imperial Rule Assistance Society (Taisei Yokusankai)."
japdom.25.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.26.t:0 "The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai"
japdom.26.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai, or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level, a direct link between politics and the people will be established. By having every important interest group represented at its core, it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policies. Sadly, that vision has already collapsed, as the various movements the Taisei Yokusankai was meant to bind together have already begun to argue and compete for control of the society.\n\nThree main groups have emerged at the convention. The leading group is the Kakushinha (Reformist Faction) headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself, composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. The second group is the Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kodo', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association).\n\nThe latter two object to the Kakushinha's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition."
japdom.26.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.27.t:0 "Konoe Fumimaro Secures Support"

japdom.29.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.31.t:0 "General Election"
japdom.31.d:0 "Democracy has survived the fateful winter and election reform securing its place has been passed. However, with the failure of the National Unity government the government lacks the power and mandate to rule effectively. The solution is clear however: trust in its election reforms and take the issue to the people; the Government has called an election to confirm its electoral mandate and regain the political initiative!"
japdom.31.a:0 "Elect Rikken Seiyukai (Conservatives)."
japdom.31.b:0 "Elect Minseito (Liberals)."
japdom.31.c:0 "Maintain the ruling coalition."

japdom.32.t:0 "A Party Divided"
japdom.32.d:0 "During the Rikken Seiyukai convention of 1936, Nakajima had felt his leading role was insecure and made power-sharing agreements with other factions. One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council.\n\nLast month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted to complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Domei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Domei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyukai."
japdom.32.a:0 "It is time to find our own path."

japdom.33.t:0 "Formation of the Kokumin Domei"

japdom.35.t:0 "The Cabinet Planning Board"
japdom.35.d:0 "With the Black Monday recession, general economic and political turmoil threatening the Japanese export markets in the Pacific, the Government has begun to review its economic policies. We mainly export raw silk and other consumer goods- our industrial goods are still inadequate compared with most western nations. Various measures to remedy the situation have been suggested and a Cabinet Planning Board (Kikakuin) has been established to study and plan future economic policy."
japdom.35.a:0 "Good."

japdom.36.t:0 "Zaibatsu Corruption Scandal"
japdom.36.d:0 "As we feared, today several high-ranking government officials with links to the Zaibatsu have been accused of corruption. This is not the first time such accusations have been made and we fear it will not be the last. While some say it is good they were caught, it nevertheless represents another blow to our government given our close support of the Zaibatsu.\n\nThe trial will start in a few days but given the vast amount of wealth these officials will be able to mobilise it will no doubt be a long and painful road to justice, if we ever even get there... "
japdom.36.a:0 "A shameful display!"

japdom.39.t:0 "Further Integration of Korea"

japdom.51.t:0 "Tokko Officers Accused of Torture"
japdom.51.d:0 "The Tokko, or 'Special Higher Police', is a police force specialising in social and thought crimes. The Tokko is also notorious for its abusive and brutal methods of interrogation, sometimes even resulting in death. When the National Security Act was passed, the Tokko rapidly expanded its size and operation, and their regard for the safety of accused criminals declined even further. Today a major newspaper has reported that a man died while in custody, and has accused the Tokko of torturing the victim to death."
japdom.51.a:0 "Oh no..."

japdom.52.t:0 "The Repeal of the National Security Act"
japdom.52.d:0 "The increasing excesses and abuses of the National Security Act has forced politicians to reconsider its worth. The Act served its purpose and saved a lot of lives from terrorism, but maybe it has outlived its usefulness."
japdom.52.a:0 "Repeal the act."

japdom.53.t:0 "The Great Drought of 1939"
japdom.53.d:0 "The country is in the middle of the worst drought it has seen this century. Water supplies are critically low and crops are dying of thirst. In some regions, local officials are organising rainmaking rituals in a desperate attempt to evoke storms and calm the people, but to no avail. Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However, the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being."

Manchuria has largely been spared the drought, and while it would have to make do with less food for some time, our political and economic stranglehold over the country should be enough to prevent any dissent."

japdom.241.t:0 "Fate of the Imperial Family"
japdom.241.d:0 "With the finalization of the last branches of the new governmental system, future of the Imperial Family is discussed once again. It is quite obvious that the Imperial Family cannot function like it used to for over a thousand years. A change is needed. We can either bring ourselves to drastic measures or treat the issue more lightly, as to not make more enemies in the Japanese society. What should we do?"
japdom.241.a:0 "Put them against the wall."
japdom.241.b:0 "Leave them be, but powerless. They will no longer be aristocracy."
japdom.241.c:0 "Exile them."

japdom.242.t:0 "Black Monday Reaches the Shores"
japdom.242.d:0 "Eventually, as expected, the domino effect of the economic failure in the German Empire has reached our Empire. While we are not as affected as our neighbours in the region, due to our quite grand economic isolation from the German markets, we still were touched by it. The Zaibatsu and our banks will have a hard time for a few months."
japdom.242.a:0 "That was to be expected."

japdom.243.t:0 "Disagreements Within Army Leadership"
japdom.243.d:0 "The ongoing factional rivalry within the ranks of the IJA has found a new front: the military strategic debate between the two rising stars, Major General Nagata Tetsuzan (of the Centralist Faction) and Major General Obata Toshishiro (of the Restorationist Faction).\n\nGeneral Nagata believes the Japanese economy is inadequate to sustain any kind of total warfare, and thus, building up an army capable of total war should be our top objective. He calls for expanding our mobilisation capability, modernising equipment, and centralising the command structure.\n\nGeneral Obata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion; due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capacity through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war.\n\nBoth agree a centralised command structure is a good idea, and that raw manpower tactics are a poor strategy; we can never hope to compete with Russian or Chinese manpower. We may now choose how to proceed."
japdom.243.a:0 "I will choose wisely."

japdom.301.t:0 "A Question of Dedication"
japdom.301.d:0 "While our decision to follow technological supremacy and quality over quantity makes perfect tactical sense, there are still some of our admirals who are saying we are not dedicated enough to this concept and are calling for further improvements of our quality standards. However, their opponents are arguing that this will lead to decreased output of our already limited production capacity."
japdom.301.a:0 "We must pursue ultimate quality in our ships."
japdom.301.b:0 "We can't hamper our naval production any more."

japdom.302.t:0 "A Question of Dedication"
japdom.302.d:0 "While our decision to abandon technological supremacy and quality over quantity makes perfect tactical sense, there are still some of our admirals who are saying we are not dedicated enough to this concept and are calling for further simplification of our existing designs. However, their opponents are arguing that this will lead to further decreases in the quality of our ships."
japdom.302.a:0 "We must cut corners wherever it is possible."
japdom.302.b:0 "We mustn't hamper the quality of our ships any more."

japdom.303.t:0 "Direction of Plane Development"
japdom.303.d:0 "Our great engineers have prepared plans for new generation of carrier planes. While it can take time to develop all of them, we could dedicate our resources to at least one type and prepare it for duty, much sooner."
japdom.303.a:0 "Fighter planes are key!"
japdom.303.b:0 "Dive bombers are vital!"
japdom.303.c:0 "Torpedo bombers are crucial!"

japdom.304.t:0 "New Naval Prototype Flying!"
japdom.304.d:0 "After many sleepless months, our engineers and workers were able to build and even fly with one of the new prototype carrier planes; what great news!"
japdom.304.a:0 "Great news!"
