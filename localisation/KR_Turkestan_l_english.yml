## Turkestan ##
POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ALIM_DESC:0 "Emir Said Mir Mohammed Alim Khan is the last ruler of a royal title inherited from the empire of Genghis Khan, the Khanate of Bukhara, and the nominal ruler of the Islamic Federation of Turkestan. His rule, from 1911 onwards, initially began with promise - the emir enacted reforms in taxation and administration, and some believed that he may be the reformist whom Bukhara needs to become an independent state again. It turned out that his reforms were only there to strengthen his power, however, and the reformers present within the Khanate were exiled or repressed. As the Russian Civil War began, Bukhara, like its sister Khanate of Khiva, broke ties with the government in Moscow and declared its independence - during the conflict, they successfully defeated the Bolsheviks, evicted the British-supported Transcaspian Autonomy, and united the Central Asian lands under a traditionalist Muslim federation.\n\nAs time went on, the Emir has become increasingly influenced by the thought of Ibrahim Bek, a lower class Uzbek tribesman who rapidly ranked up in the Bukharan army during the Russian Civil War. A talented guerrilla warrior, Ibrahim Bek is also a religious conservative opposed to the Jadid movement and speaks to the Emir with the promise of a unified, rightfully Islamic Central Asia. And it seems the Emir is sympathetic."

### Events ###
trk.1.t:0 "The Emirate of Bukhara"
trk.1.d:0 "In 1917, the Provisional Government of Russia recognized the independence of the Emirate of Bukhara. In the years that followed, the young nation has been more than occupied with its own conflicts. The gorgeous steppe has far too often become a battlefield upon which various factions and warlords slaughter each other. Even with the constant fighting, however, one man has been able to rule the country with an iron fist. 1936 marks the 25th year of Mohammed Alim Khan’s reign over Bukhara, a reign that initially promised sweeping changes and a bright new future — only for Khan to continue the Islamic Nationalist status quo by allying with the Basmachi movement. It would seem not even independence could bring change to Bukhara, for it is still plagued by the illiteracy, corruption, and weakness that defined the region decades ago. Yet even as thousands of refugees attempt to leave its borders, there are still those who have not yet lost hope that it shall modernize and enter into a glorious new era."
trk.1.a:0 "Serquyosh hur o'lkam!"

trk.2.t:0 "Junaid Khan Congratulates Emir"
trk.2.d:0 "Today, the Emir received a letter from his good friend, the Junaid Khan, expressing his warmest congratulations on his 25th Anniversary of his rule. The Vizier of the Khivan Khanate has been one of the Emir’s closest friends in the past, and so the contents of the letter are no surprise. What is a surprise to the Emir, however, is that the Vizier was able to send a letter in the first place. With rumors and gossip about Junaid Khan’s illness as of late, it is undoubtedly a relief to be given proof that his old friend is well enough to continue correspondence. Already, he has begun writing a response."
trk.2.a:0 "The Emir sends his regards and hopes of your good health."

trk.3.t:0 "Junaid Khan's Dead!"
trk.3.d:0 "Disaster has struck! This morning, the Khivan emissary informed the Emir of the passing of the Serdar-Karim, Junaid Khan. The old hero of Khiva died of a stroke yesterday, at the age of 79. The news was a complete shock to the Emir, who had dismissed the rumors of the Vizier’s illness after their recent correspondence. Little did he know, the Serdar-Karim’s letter to the Emir would be his last. There may be little time for the distraught Khan to mourn his friend, however. Khiva’s situation has deteriorated overnight, and Bukhara must be mindful to be prepared for the chaos that may ensue."
trk.3.a:0 "Long Live Bukhara and Khiva."

trk.4.t:0 "Alliance with Young Bukhara?"
trk.4.d:0 "With the situation in Khiva erupting, many of the Emir’s advisors have begged him to make concessions to the Young Bukhara movement. They warn that if he continues to uphold the miserable status quo, his rule will be the next to fall. However, the Vizier, Ibrahim Bek, and Basmachi have fervently protested against any negotiation with the “radical modernists.” Early into his reign, the Emir was indeed a supporter of the reformists, but ever since realizing he would have no place in their Bukhara, he has been very weary of negotiation. With the recent turn of events, inaction is no longer an option, for Young Bukhara is simply too strong to ignore. The Emir must make his decision: Compromise with Young Bukhara, or Purge Young Bukhara."
trk.4.a:0 "Invite Young Bukhara into the Council of Ministers."
trk.4.b:0 "Better suppress this movement."

trk.5.t:0 "Young Bukhara Demands Elections"
trk.5.d:0 "The Young Bukhara Party has submitted an ultimatum to the Emir and Vizier. Hold a free and fair election and adopt Young Bukhara’s proposed Constitution, or “face the consequences". The Emir’s court has erupted into chaos following the ultimatum, complete with intense and even violent debates about how the Emir should respond. Some advisors insist the Emir’s acceptance is the only way to keep the peace in Bukhara, while others declare that agreeing to the ultimatum will doom the Great Emir to being a mere puppet, and eventually, deposed. What everyone can agree upon, however, is that the Emir’s decision will prove decisive in deciding the future of the Emirate. Now, the good people of Bukhara wait with bated breath for their Emir to make his choice..."
trk.5.a:0 "Agree to their demands."
trk.5.b:0 "The Emir won't drop the reins of government!"

trk.6.t:0 "Violence in Bukhara"
trk.6.d:0 "There is chaos in the streets of Bukhara! Following the Emir’s refusal to accept Young Bukhara’s ultimatum, the radicals kept their promises to bring “consequences”, which has taken the form of a massive protest in the city. The police struggled to keep the protesters back as they advanced towards the Sitora-i Mokhi Khosa, shouting demands for the Emir to abdicate. The Emir has not yet budged, and still has a force of guards ready to disperse the crowd, by force if necessary. As night broke over noble Bukhara, the opposition's leaders sent a messenger to Alim Khan, giving the Emir one last chance to abdicate and be spared before the march on the palace began..."
trk.6.a:0 "At last, the Emir concedes, and opens the doors."
trk.6.b:0 "The messenger's head is returned to the protesters. The Battle for Bukhara has begun."

trk.7.t:0 "Young Bukhara Victory!"
trk.7.d:0 "The fight that ensued was a bloody and brutal one, and one that cost the lives of numerous protesters and guards. As the sun rises over the city once again, it is clear that despite the best efforts of the Emir's guard, they were unable to defend the Sitora-i Mokhi Khosa from the onslaught of the radicals. The palace was breached, and the Emir only barely escaped with his life, tearfully looking back at the city one last time before his departure. It is believed he is fleeing into exile within Afghanistan. With the palace utterly ravaged, it would instead be the Grand Minaret where Young Bukhara’s leaders proclaimed the birth of the Republic of Bukhara."
trk.7.a:0 "It’s a new day in Bukhara."

trk.8.t:0 "Young Bukhara Suppressed!"
trk.8.d:0 "As the radicals began their advance, the guards held their ground. Scores of rebels fell before the guns of the guards, and as night became morning, it was clear they would not take the Sitora-i Mokhi Khosa. Finally, upon the Emir's command, the guards and police began their counterattack, driving the rabble further and further into the city's outskirts and capturing several leaders. As noble Bukhara finally settled down, the Emir emerged from the palace to proclaim a new dawn for Bukhara. It would be a day of peace and prosperity, free from the chaos that Young Bukhara almost brought to the Emirate."
trk.8.a:0 "It's just another day in Bukhara."

trk.9.t:0 "Socialist Insurgency in Karakum"
trk.9.d:0 "The Karakum desert, though only sparsely populated, was seized by the Khivan Khanate during the Russian Civil War. The majority of the area has been under the control of local Soviet councils who still carry out their deeds and missions underground and out of sight throughout the region. Most of them are marauders, rural proletariat, and bandits. Now they have renewed their raids on our and Khivan caravans, landlords and merchants. The situation is getting worse and we should definitely do something."
trk.9.a:0 "Send in the Basmachi."

trk.10.t:0 "Socialists Captured Ashgabad"
trk.10.d:0 "The Socialist banditry has been united under Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov, a talented and charismatic leader who was closely connected to the Young Bukhara movement before the Civil War. He has raised a militia of loyal workers and other disgruntled proletariats and has captured our largest and most prosperous city: Karakum. We must respond quickly and with great force to try to crush these bandits that continue to destabilize our country. We have numerous options for how we can best go about defending our regime. How shall we proceed?"
trk.10.a:0 "Protect Bokhara."
trk.10.b:0 "Try to destroy his army in Ashgabad."
trk.10.c:0 "Protect Kyzylkum."

trk.11.t:0 "Socialists Captured Kyzylkum"
trk.11.d:0 "The Socialist banditry has been united under Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov, a talented and charismatic leader who was closely connected to the Young Bukhara movement before the Civil War. He has raised a militia of loyal workers and other disgruntled proletariats and has captured region of Kyzylkum, where our main trade route with Khiva is located. It means that the Socialist horde is fast approaching Bokhara."
trk.11.a:0 "Attempt to seize Ashgabad and surround enemy in Kyzylkum."
trk.11.b:0 "Protect Bokhara."
trk.11.c:0 "Ride to crush his army in Kyzylkum."

trk.12.t:0 "Basmachi Occupied Karakum"
trk.12.d:0 "The brave and honorable Basmachi have managed to capture Karakum and, with the high of victory propelling them, now move to surround the enemy in Kyzylkum. However, we have less forces protecting our vital stronghold in Bokhara now, and it will take much time for the Basmachi to return to the capital."
trk.12.a:0 "Seize Kyzylkum and crush the enemy."
trk.12.b:0 "Fall back to protect Bokhara as we wait for the Basmachi to return."

trk.13.t:0 "Socialists Captured Bokhara"
trk.13.d:0 "Socialists managed to capture unprotected Bokhara. The government had left the city and now it seems that nothing can stop Mukhitdinov from establishing Soviet power in Bukhara."
trk.13.a:0 "Mukhitdinov proclaims People's Republic."

trk.14.t:0 "Socialists Crushed in Kyzylkum"
trk.14.d:0 "It was a mistake for Mukhitdinov to move to Kyzylkum! The Basmachi, prepared and eager for battle, have crushed the vile Reds in Kyzylkum. Mukhitdinov has been routed and made to flee with his army, slinking back into hiding somewhere near our border with Kokand. Meanwhile, the Basmachi have crushed the remnants of his weak militia in Kyzylkum. The Soviet’s resistance will probably continue, unless we do something more to completely eradicate them, but for now it seems we have earned our victory over the Socialists."
trk.14.a:0 "Mukhitdinov fled the pit like a rat."

trk.15.t:0 "Basmachi Raids in Pamir"
trk.15.d:0 "In the aftermath of the fall of the Emir and his puppeteers, the former rulers of Bukhara, have been rather quiet...perhaps too quiet. These former rulers are mainly made up of the leadership of the Basmachi movement, and it is unclear what they are planning next. In the past few weeks, sightings of Basmachi activity were reported around the border with Afghanistan. Now, that activity has culminated in an insurgency. The Basmachi leaders have announced to the world the creation of a new Islamic Federation “destined to retake noble Bukhara in the name of Islam.” Acting fast, our leaders have already begun to ready their forces for an offensive to wipe out these fundamentalists. However, with the insurgency centered in the treacherous Pamir Mountains, eliminating the Islamic Federation may not be so easy. Some argue that it would be better to lure them out into more open ground, and eliminate them that way. Either way, a choice must be made to deal with the resurgent reactionaries before they get too threatening."
trk.15.a:0 "Fight them in the Pamir Mountains!"
trk.15.b:0 "We shall defend our home and repel them on our own ground."

trk.16.t:0 "Basmachi Crushed Us in Pamir"
trk.16.d:0 "As expected, the mountainous area of Pamir aided the Basmachi forces to great effect in their desperate defence. As our forces took more and more casualties assaulting those rugged hills, we were forced to make a hasty retreat with our few remaining troops, all limping bruised and scarred back to camp. The Basmachi have earned themselves a decisive victory in the battle, further consolidating their power in Pamir. We must be careful and remain smart if we are to maintain our revolt’s steam."
trk.16.a:0 "It's unlikely they will ambush us, rest easy and lick your wounds."
trk.16.b:0 "We can bandage our wounds on the march! Protect Kyzylkum in case they try to surround us."

trk.17.t:0 "Basmachi Captured Kyzylkum"
trk.17.d:0 "The Basmachi have long instigated unrest in the city and as their forces approached the main gates of the city, a militia army sprang to life from within Kyzylkum’s walls, surrounding us as we rested. However, this has also left their flank exposed and, if quick, we can cut into the rear now, capturing Pamir and leaving the enemy’s forces to rot in the Kyzylkum desert, where we can easily crush them. Shall we try to seize a city in chaos, or strike their exposed guard and drive their armies into the desert wastes?"
trk.17.a:0 "Crush them in Pamir."
trk.17.b:0 "Try to seize Kyzylkum."

trk.18.t:0 "Basmachi Destroyed in Pamir"
trk.18.d:0 "We have crushed the weakened Basmachi in Pamir, and the survivors have been left to seek shelter in that blasted desert. Now, it will be easy for us to crush them in Kyzylkum, hopefully ending their influence in our region once and for all. However, maybe we should shore up the defenses at Bukhara, in case they decide to capture our capital as we revel in the joys of our recent win."
trk.18.a:0 "Crush them in Kyzylkum."
trk.18.b:0 "Protect Bokhara."

trk.19.t:0 "Basmachi Destroyed in Kyzylkum"
trk.19.d:0 "We have crushed the last stronghold of the Basmachi in Bukhara. The remnants of their militia have fled to Kokand where they have attempted to merge with various traditionalist and Kadimist organizations. However, it's unlikely they will be accepted there given the traditional rivalry between our two nations and the reputation the Basmachi carry."
trk.19.a:0 "The day is ours!"

trk.20.t:0 "Basmachi Captured Bokhara"
trk.20.d:0 "We were too weak and too purblind to expect the Basmachi to attack us in Bokhara. Now they have seized our administrative buildings and forced our government to resign. This day is the day of final victory of the Basmachi in Bukhara."
trk.20.a:0 "Long live the Islamic Federation."

trk.21.t:0 "Basmachi Victory in Khiva"
trk.21.d:0 "The Basmachi reaffirmed their power in Khiva with Sayid Abdullah consolidating his rule as an absolute monarch. This issue however is worrying, as it means that the Young Khiva party will be actively suppressed and most of its members shall join the Young Bukhara Party. We can make an alliance with them to prevent bloodshed, or strengthen Basmachi support in our region."
trk.21.a:0 "Reach out in the name of cooperation."
trk.21.b:0 "Instead, let us strengthen our own position."

trk.22.t:0 "First Bukharan Elections"
trk.22.d.rep:0 "The First Bukharan Elections are to be held now. The Young Bukhara Party is represented by two main factions: the Socialists, led by Usman Hodzha and the Moderates, led by Mirzo Abdulvokhid Munzim."
trk.22.d.mon:0 "The First Bukharan Elections are to be held now. The Young Bukhara Party is represented by two main factions: the Socialists, led by Usman Hodzha and the Conservatives, led by Mirzo Abdulvokhid Munzim."
trk.22.a:0 "Usman Hodzha's Socialists."
trk.22.b:0 "Young Bukhara Moderates."
trk.22.c:0 "Young Bukhara Conservatives."

trk.23.t:0 "Constitution of Bukhara"
trk.23.d:0 "The dark ages have ended and Bukhara emerges from the shadows a new and modern state!. The source of authority will now be people of our fine lands. People of different religions, political views, ethnicities, and cultures shall all be united under one single banner - the flag of Bukhara. This is a monumental and historic step for our people and our hallowed states towards the future and modernity!."
trk.23.a:0 "We the People have the say, finally."


turkestan.1.t:0 "The Hour is at Hand!"
turkestan.1.d:0 "We are now at war with the infidels in Kazakhstan. Should we send out a call to all of the Turkmen tribes to engage in a Holy War? While their help may not be necessary, it would allow us to minimize the amount of our own blood we spill while also allowing us to revel in this victory over our historic northern foe with our cultural brothers. How shall we proceed?"
turkestan.1.a:0 "Call up the tribes!"
turkestan.1.b:0 "Our armies are large enough already."

turkestan.2.t:0 "Skirmishes on the Frontier"
turkestan.2.d:0 "There have been a small series of skirmishes between our border patrols and Kazakh police forces. One such skirmish has reportedly turned to tragedy as reports come in from the border. Eight of our brave soldiers were reportedly killed, and many across the nation and within our armed forces are saying that it is time to launch a war to avenge their deaths, and liberate the Muslims of the Orda from rule by apostates!"
turkestan.2.a:0 "We must move into Kazakhstan!"
turkestan.2.b:0 "The time is not yet right."

turkestan.3.t:0 "Call for War"
turkestan.3.d:0 "An influential congress of clerics have issued a stern denouncement of our government's policy of co-existence with Alash Orda to the north. They have stated that it is time for us to fight and establish Islamic rule over the whole of Central Asia."
turkestan.3.a:0 "We must move into Kazakhstan!"
turkestan.3.b:0 "The time is not yet right."

turkestan.9.t:0 "We are Victorious!"
turkestan.9.d:0 "Kazakhstan has been fully subjugated by Turkestan! The foul state of the infidels is no more! The Light of Islam shall shine down upon the heathens once more as the will of Allah is returned to these steppes."
turkestan.9.a:0 "This is merely the first step to rebuilding the Caliphate."
turkestan.9.b:0 "We must now only promote where we rule."

turkestan.13.t:0 "The Emir is dead"
turkestan.13.d:0 "Mohammed Alim Khan, the Emir of Bukhara and grand Head of State of the Islamic Federation of Turkestan, has passed away today due to natural causes. The Council of State is now deliberating on who will be the next supreme ruler of the country: will the Emir's son, Crown Prince Shahmurad, inherit his father's position? Will the ambitious Ibrahim Bek be able to finally assume supreme power in Turkestan? Or will the shadowy clerical faction under Mufti Ishan Babakhan triumph?"
turkestan.13.a:0 "Crown Prince Shahmurad assumes power."
turkestan.13.b:0 "Ibrahim Bek consolidates his dictatorship."
turkestan.13.c:0 "Mufti Ishan Babakhan will bring the rule of Islam to the land."

TRK_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Russian Civil War, the Central Asian region was left in chaos, desolated by feud and famine. Bukhara, led by Emir Mohammed Alim Khan, has managed to overcome the difficulties, but at the cost of internal stability. Various groups are breaking country apart, but they all want the same. Firstly, power and secondly, to unite the Turkestan into a single state."
KYR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The republic of Kokand is has survived the Russian Civil War mainly with the help of Alash and the Whites. Today Kokand is the only independent democracy in the region, trying to maintain its position and restrain reactionary forces in the country. If Turkestan is united once, perhaps it will be a Central Asian Democracy."
UZB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The existence of Khanate of Khiva has been more or less guaranteed by its stronger neighbour of Bukhara. Since 1918 the Khanate was ruled by a military dictator, Vizier Junaid-Khan. But his health becoming worse and worse with country risking a chance of ceasing to exist without its charismatic leader."
