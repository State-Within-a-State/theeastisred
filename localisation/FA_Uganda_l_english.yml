uga.1.t:0 "Uganda Breaks off"
uga.1.d:0 "The traitorous dogs to the south in Uganda have stabbed us in the back today with their declaration of secession from the joint Kenya-Ugandan colonial experiment. The dogs in Kampala have decided to go their own way in the wake of growing instability and the imminent collapse of Mittelafrika. Though their future is far from certain, the government in Kampala has declared that a future they can decide is a far better future than the alternative, which would be licking the German boot like the snakes in Nairobi. The great union of Kenyans and Ugandans dissolves today, and with it, the north of Mittelafrika falls into chaos."
uga.1.a:0 "Traitors!"

uga.2.t:0 "Rothschild Takes over Uganda"
uga.2.d:0 "With Uganda’s recent secession from their former brothers in Kenya, a peculiar turn of events has transpired. Under the direction of family patriarch Lionel de Rothschild, the affluent and infamous Rothschild family has stepped into the newly freed state, seeking to carve out a new Jewish homeland on the Dark Continent. Renaming the region as the “State of Israel-Uganda,” the Rothschilds are poised to create a new Promised Land for God’s Chosen. As the caustic cauldron of Mittelafrika threatens to boil over, whether or not this odd little state survives the brewing chaos remains to be seen, but under Lionel de Rothschild’s guiding hand, the future of both Ugandans and Jews seem brighter than ever before in this new Land of Milk and Honey."
uga.2.a:0 "For the Rothschilds!"
uga.2.b:0 "The Rothschilds are pushed back and the Kingdom of Buganda Survives!"

uga.3.t:0 "The Death of the Kabaka"
uga.3.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the nation, and millions are in mourning, for our king Daudi Cwa II, 34th Kabaka of the Kingdom of Buganda and our national father, has passed away. Suffering from illness and the stress of rising political and ethno-religious tensions within the nation since the collapse of Mittelafrika, Daudi Cwa II died in his sleep, surrounded by family, at his palace in Salaama outside Kampala at the age of 43 and after reigning since he was just a year old. Despite dubious claims that he was poisoned, the government has assured the masses that his death was wholly natural, and now the Lukiiko - our national parliament - is set to vote internally on the new Kabaka. Despite the secret nature of the selection process for a new Kabaka, many in the nation expect for Sir Edward Frederick William David Walugembe Mutebi Luwangula - the previous king’s fifth son - to be elected, but with one caveat. \n\nAs the young ‘Prince Freddy’ is only 15, a Council of Regents will likely be formed to administer the nation until he comes of age and is able to assume full powers - an eventuality that has angered the small but loud group of firebrands campaigning for the return of Bugandan absolutism. The Lukiiko is also expected by many to use the young future king as a tool to force their reformist anti-authoritarian measures hellbent on weakning the position of the monarchy, though this prospect has already caused political in-fighting - a danger only spurred on by the recent rise in radicalism since our independence as well as from the tensions with the Zionists. Regardless of the future, all that is certain now is that a great man, a great king, and a great hero of our independence has passed away, and now our nation is cast adrift into the sea of the unknown. Let us hope the new Kabaka can guide us safely though as the process to select a new Kabaka soon begins again."
uga.3.a:0 "May Daudie Cwa II rest in peace, and may our future be kind to his young successor."

uga.4.t:0 "The Election of the 35th Kabaka"
uga.4.d:0 "The selection process for a new Kabaka is a unique and secretive process. By traditional law, the firstborn son of the previous king, called the Kiweewa, is banned from being chosen. This is done because each Kiweewa would be too obvious a candidate, and would likely be subject to assassination attempts and other conflict each cycle as rivial princes and forces bid for power. Instead, the Kiweewa is given special roles in the government under the monarchy, and aids in the selection process. All princes besides the Kiweewa are treated as equals in the process, and a special council within the Lukiiko is called to secretly observe each candidate in order to determine the best candidate. Once one has been selected, the verification council will quietly give the chosen heir a piece of bark cloth. This cloth is only to be revealed during the final burial of the previous Kabaka, after all princes and princesses have entered the room to pay their respects to their fallen king. Only then will the previously-secret chosen heir step forward and lay the bark cloth atop the resting body of their fallen liege, revealing to all present and the wider nation that they shall be king. \n\nThis process has continued for centuries since the first Kabaka Kato Kintu who reigned during the 1300s, and has continued once more with the death of Daudi Cwa II. After observing all the possible princes, the fifth son of Daudi Cwa II was given the bark cloth as expected by many, and at his funeral early this morning, the young boy ‘Prince Freddy’ revealed the cloth to all. Now, the 15 year old is being prepared to be crowned as Mutesa II and a regency council is being formed to aid him until he is of age. He has taken the name of his patrilineal great-great-great grandfather, honoring his ancestors for the entire royal clan of Buganda - the Olulyo Olulangira - can trace its lineage through the patrilineal bloodline all the way back to the first Kabaka. With Mutesa II chosen, Buganda finally has its new Kabaka, the 35th king to reign in over 600 years, and now hopefully our monarchy can get back on track as the wolves circle our fragile monarchy."
uga.4.a:0 "Praise Kabaka Mutesa, second of his name, King of Buganda, and sovereign of all Ugandans."
