### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_OBAMA_DESC:0 "For 11 years the Mau-Mau have resisted for forces of Kenya-Uganda. At the head of the resistance is a man by the name of Onyango Obama, the sole salvation of Kenya against imperialist forces. Even though times may seem bleak, the Kenya Land and Freedom Army holds strong, and will do so until the bitter end. Until the end comes, Obama will lead the Mau-Mau against all forces of imperialism, whether they be the Germans or the perfidious Syndicalists based in London or Paris. Obama’s Socialism is not one crafted in the halls of European Elites, but in the heart of Africa. To the enemies of Obama, to the enemies of the People of Africa; no mercy will be shown, no concessions given, and no surrender accepted."

POLITICS_PUNISHED_OBAMA_DESC:0 "After the disastrous climax of the Mau-Mau’s initial revolution, our forces were scattered and slaughtered, mercilessly gunned down by the frontier forces of Kenya-Uganda. Onyago Obama himself was thought to be dead, with his closest associates fleeing into hiding under the command of his right hand man Dedan Kimathi, who has also made sure to save Obama’s only son. What no one knew, however, was that Obama had miraculously survived the battle! Crawling dozens of miles to the nearest safe village while clutching his bleeding gunshot and sabre wounds, he limped painfully to safety. Once in the care of local sympathizers, he would plot his revenge as the tribal healers tended to his wounds that would horrifically scar his body for life. Awaiting the perfect day to reveal his survival to his people, the collapse of the bloated Mittelafrikan monstrosity has provided the perfect stage for his return. Once again, Obama marches towards his destiny, seemingly back from the dead, infuriated and more determined than ever before. For the people of Africa, for Totalism, only Obama can be their true salvation."

POLITICS_STANLEY_MATHENGE_DESC:0 "When Mathenge brutally eliminated his rivals for power within Kinyaa, he had no intention of slowing down or stopping there. Now that he is in power, he has plans for his people. With the European imperialists largely out of the picture, Mathenge believes it is time to give the formerly stolen land back to the native populations, who will farm it and tend to it as their ancestors did. For Mathenge, it is more than just revering the traditions of our ancestors; we must also ensure the dominance of the Kikuyus in our part of the continent. To do so, he believes we should bring our weaker neighbors into the fold in order to create a united front against any European who tries to take back this land. Equally as important as this, it is crucial that the influence of European culture and faith is wiped from Africa, and this will be done through force if necessary. Mathenge, though presenting a tough image to the world, only wishes to see his people prosper as they did before the meddlesome hands of outsiders forced their way into the lives of the Kikuyu people. With enough resources at his disposal, and the will to bring the nation into the Modern Era industrially and militarily, he could very well see this desire come to fruition..."

POLITICS_DEDAN_KIMATHI_DESC:0 "Dedan Kimathi, one of the youngest leaders in the entire movement, has beaten his rivals to become the leader of Kinyaa. He has created legitimacy for himself by taking the son of his mentor and former leader, Onyango Obama, into his own care. Now, serving as regent for the young Obama, Kimathi has had no problem articulating his vision to his people. For Kimathi, the implementation of socialism in the nation's agrarian sector is key to seeing its farmers prosper. Further, it would also achieve the goal of returning the land to its rightful owners-the Kenyan people. Meanwhile, Kimathi does not look as unfavorably towards Europeans as his fellow revolutionaries have; as long as they are aligned with the Third Internationale, Kimathi does not care. Instead, he hopes to model his new state partly off of their example and partly off his own beliefs, which entail local democracy for his people and unity among Kenyans. To guarantee the continued existence of his new fragile state, Kimathi has expressed a desire for a strong military and industrial sector alike. With the ability to fend off invaders, both inwardly and from across the ocean, Kimathi can focus on building a strong state for his people."

POLITICS_BABY_OBAMA_DESC:0 "Barack Obama is one of the most interesting figures to have emerged out of the chaos that was the fall of Mittelfrika. Son of the revered hero of Kenya, Onyango Obama, Barack had always lived in the shadow of his father’s legacy and actions, and that of his teacher and predecessor Dedan Kithmani. Having been predestined as the next leader of Kenya from a young age, the stress of such expectations have taken its toll on the young man, making the barely eighteen year old appear even older than his own late father. However, his fiery spirit and eagerness to create a better future for Kenya gives confidence to many, including the retired Kithmani, who is proud of the boy like a father towards his son."

### Focuses ###

KIK_mau_mau_bush_war:0 "The Bush War Continues"
KIK_mau_mau_bush_war_desc:0 "For 11 years we have fought and bled to free Kenya. With the dawn of 1936, Obama is determined that this will be the last year of the Bush War. We will either be victorious or not be at all."
KIK_resistance_to_the_end:0 "Resistance to the Bitter End"
KIK_resistance_to_the_end_desc:0 "Even though Obama has promised that we shall finally come to victory, in the impossible scenario that we do lose, Obama has instated a backup plan known as the resistance to the end plan. With this plan, we will never be able to taste defeat even if we lose the coming great battle!"
KIK_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Rebellion"
KIK_call_to_arms_desc:0 "As we prepare for the final battle, we are going to need more men. To this end, Obama has green lit a great propaganda campaign across Kenya. Obama himself is set to give a great radio speech, one that shall be heard all around Kenya. Furthermore, a series of covert poster drops shall be made. By the time we are done, all Kenyans shall know the time is coming, the Light of Obama shall soon engulf all of Kenya!"
KIK_arms_trade:0 "Blood and Bullets"
KIK_arms_trade_desc:0 "As the final battle approaches ever quicker, we require arms. It is no secret that the Mau-Mau are using highly outdated equipment. It is also no secret that we are quickly running out of bullets. In order to solve this, Obama has agreed to an offer from a mercenary company based out of the Congo. They will provide us with modern equipment. In exchange, we are to take out a few “problem” colonial administrators for them. While some may scoff at this, once they learn the Great Obama is the one who took the deal, they will quickly be silenced."
KIK_fortify_the_mountain:0 "The Mountain's Final Test"
KIK_fortify_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mt. Kenya, the great symbol of both our revolt and people, is a very powerful and moving image to the minds of the Mau-Mau. For us, it shows that while oppression may come, it can never fully destroy a people. The Mountain has been here from the beginning, and will be, until the end. The Mountain is also symbolic of the Great Mountain of the Mau-Mau, Obama. Obama stands above us all, guiding us, as a lighthouse guides ships at sea. Just as ship at sea when the lighthouse goes out crashes against the rocks of the shore, so too will the Mau-Mau crash without the guidance of Obama. This coming battle will be a great test for the Mountain of the Mau-Mau, but with the love of the people and the unity of Totalism, there is no way the Mountain will not be able to stand firm in the coming storm."
KIK_only_obama:0 "Only Obama..."
KIK_only_obama_desc:0 "Obama. The very mention of His name causes our enemies to cringe in fear, as they should. Obama the Great, leader of the Mau-Mau, is the sole hope of Afrika. It is Only Obama, with a wisdom far surpassing that of King Solomon, who can free not just Kenya, but all of Afrika. Only Obama can lead us, the Mau-Maus of the KLFA, to victory. Long Live Obama! "
KIK_only_totalism:0 "Only Totalism..."
KIK_only_totalism_desc:0 "Totalism: an ideology born not in the halls of some European College, but in the hearts of men who saw the corruption and vanity of Syndicalism and Radical Socialism. Totalism is the only acceptable idea of the White Devil. Without the beauty and purity of Totalism, Obama would not have been able to guide the Mau-Mau with as much success as he has. Even before Totalism was formalized in that blessed Charter, Obama has been following it in his heart, as Totalism is not something that was invented. No, Totalism is inscribed on the hearts of every true African by God, and every true Mau-Mau warrior knows this. Thus it is only with Totalism, the greatest and highest of Mankind's ideals, that Africa can be freed."
KIK_only_we_can_be_the_salvation_of_kenya:0 "Only WE can be the Salvation of Kenya"
KIK_only_we_can_be_the_salvation_of_kenya_desc:0 "The time has come. What preparations could be done have been under taken, and we shall wait no longer. One more final battle, one for the Soul of Kenya, is about to take place. If we are victorious, Kenya shall be free, with Obama and Totalism at the helm. If we fail, Great Obama says we will keep fighting on, but how can we fail with Obama to lead us?"

KIK_second_uprising:0 "A Second Great Uprising"
KIK_second_uprising_desc:0 "Though Obama’s initial uprising was eventually snuffed out and driven back to the mountains and wastes of Kenya’s wilds, it was not a total failure. It planted the seed of rebellion in the hearts of the Kenyan people, and now, in the dying moments of Mittelafrika, we shall once more raise arms against the Kraut. The future is uncertain and chaos surrounds all, but the Second Mau-Mau Revolution shall not falter until all of Kenta is saved!"
KIK_gather_the_guns:0 "Gather New Guns"
KIK_gather_the_guns_desc:0 "If we are to arm the ever-growing number of revolutionaries that continue to flood into our ranks, or even supply the ones we already had, new weapons of war will be needed. However, we have no industry except for the few ‘factories’ captured from the colonizers and our local gunsmiths. We must perform raids deep into enemy territory to steal weapons, while also working to contact black market sources like the Senussi Order or the Triads to requisition more arms."
KIK_push_from_the_mountain:0 "Push From the Mountain"
KIK_push_from_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mount Kenya is both a great symbol of our revolt as well as a serious hub for our revolutionary government, with much of the mountain hiding tunnels and redoubts staffed with brave KFLA militias. Taking our knowledge of this terrain into account, we shall launch surprise attacks from the Kenyan highlands, waging a brutal guerilla war against Nairobi and other major colonialist holdouts that border the mountains. We will bleed them dry!"
KIK_end_the_colonials:0 "End the Colonials!"
KIK_end_the_colonials_desc:0 "The remaining colonists too foolish or unfortunate to be able to escape our nation have begun to group up, forming concentrated pockets of resistance. From these pockets, they still work to infest our lands and subdue our people, all in the pursuit of imperialist and capitalist gain. We shall wipe these holdouts from the map, one by one, leaving not a single Anglo, Kraut, or any other foul mzungu alive."
KIK_erase_dominionist_kenya:0 "Erase Dominionist Kenya"
KIK_erase_dominionist_kenya_desc:0 "The foul stench of the Anglos and their dead empire permeates everywhere, with even influence from the Kaiserreich forced to bask in the shade of the British dominance here in Kenya. This horrific level of infection from the perfidious Brits will not be tolerated any longer, as our administration moves to take immediate action towards limiting and eliminating any and all traces of the Dominionists and their imperialist cohorts."
KIK_demands_to_somalia:0 "Retake Our Rightful Land"
KIK_demands_to_somalia_desc:0 "To the North lies Jubbaland, a pristine valley inhabited by our people - descendants of the Bantu who speak our native tongue of Swahili and who partake in all the same customs and traditions we hold dear. We must approach the Somali overlords who now rule over the Jubba Valley, for all Kenyans belong in Kenya."
KIK_liberate_uganda:0 "Fate of Uganda?"
KIK_liberate_uganda_desc:0 "Uganda broke off from the now-dead Free State during the initial chaos of the Mittelafrikan collapse. However, despite their new Jewish suzerians, much of the population are still Africans - sons and daughters of the great Bantu civilizations that have stretched across East Africa for millenia. We must decide on what our position against this new state shall be, before another post-collapse power beats us to it."
KIK_strike_at_goering:0 "Pre-emptive Strike at Goering?"
KIK_strike_at_goering_desc:0 "Goring sits atop a throne of skulls in Dar-Es-Salaam, perched in his ridiculous castle playing emperor as he crushes the true sons and daughters of Africa under his boot. This must not be left to stand! The lands of the Bantu must be cleansed of all foreign taint."
KIK_congress:0 "The Future of Kenya"
KIK_congress_desc:0 "With the heartland of Kenya restored to the hands of native rule, the Kenyan Land and Freedom Army, or Mau Mau, stand triumphant over the imperialist dogs. With their enemies scattered and their former masters sent packing or sent six feet into the dirt, the future of Kenya now must be decided. The leadership of the Mau Mau is beginning to crumble as personal ambitions replace revolutionary unity. The question over who shall lead Kenya in the coming weeks is now in flux, for no one is certain now..."
KIK_obama:0 "Obama Rides On!"
KIK_obama_desc:0 "Onyango Obama has quelled the tempestuous storm that brewed amidst the inner-workings of the KFLA, arriving on the other side of this internal struggle emboldened and inspired more than ever before. Under his continued leadership, all of Africa will feel the Red Glow of Obama’s Totalist dream!"
KIK_dedan:0 "Kimathi At the Helm!"
KIK_dedan_desc:0 "Following the chaos of Obama’s untimely death, Dedan Kimathi has risen to steer the disparate and fractured Mau Mau forces back into a unified front. After dealing with the traitorous murderer Mathenge, Kimathi shall now work to bring peace, stability, and safety to the long-abused Kenyan people."
KIK_stanley:0 "Mathenge's New Order!"
KIK_stanley_desc:0 "In the wake of Obama’s constant failures and missteps, the heroic Stanley Mathenge did what no man thought possible: killing an idea. By murdering the near-prophet Obama, Mathenge snapped the brave Kikuyu people of Kenya from their trance, helping them realize their true supremacy over not only the colonizers, but to the other people of Africa. Mathenge shall now blaze a path forward to greatness, for Kinyaa!"
KIK_moving_on:0 "A New Dawn"
KIK_moving_on_desc:0 "With the dust settled and the ash clearing, one clear victor now stands above the rest in the internal struggle for power within the KFLA. Now, with the government once again coalesced around one key figure, the Mau Mau have their prophet once more. Now, together, the newly reforged and reborn KFLA shall march into a new dawn, finally free from the imperialist chains that have bound them for centuries. Harambee!"

KIK_new_kenya:0 "Kenya Reborn"
KIK_new_kenya_desc:0 "Our revolution has finally proven triumphant, and our war-torn and ragged forces now know the sweet taste of victory and freedom. Now, a free and sovereign Kenyan state stands over the ashes of the fallen colonial abomination that was the so-called ‘Free’ State. Kenya now, once again and rightfully, belongs to Kenyans, and we shall all die before we lose these lands to imperialist dogs or foreign invaders again. Harambee!"
KIK_obama_again:0 "Obama's Pan-Africa"
KIK_obama_again_desc:0 "Mzee Onyango Obama now rules solidly over the newly-freed Kenyan people, and now seeks to spread his message to all oppressed sons and daughters of this sanctified continent of Africa. Under his prophetic rule, all true Africans shall soon feel the refreshing breeze of freedom as we swoop down from these mountains, this Cradle of Humanity, and retake the Mother Continent from these imperialist hordes."
KIK_kenyan_nationalism:0 "Kenyan Nationalism"
KIK_kenyan_nationalism_desc:0 "Though many here on this Dark Continent have proven themselves worthy, steeling themselves against the unending and torturous tides of capitalist and imperialist dogs that batter this Eden so, none stand more proud and worthy than the varied peoples of Kenya. With the bravest and most righteous among us, the Kikuyu, serving as the pinnacle of our and all African peoples, Kenya shall finally prosper as these truest children of Africa guide us in the right direction as we build a modern and respected state here on the Horn. No longer shall lesser races stomp of we, the true progenitors of Humankind and Lords of the Cradle of Humanity."
KIK_honor_the_founder:0 "Honour the Founder"
KIK_honor_the_founder_desc:0 "Mzee Obama, the founder of our Kenya Land and Freedom Army and the prophetic messiah of the Mau-Mau, is the most respected and revered man in the nation, but even that is not enough! He is our muse, our protector, our shepherd; unmatched in his importance to the freedom we now enjoy and instrumental to all we now hold dear. The people of Kenya shall forever owe a debt to this hero of heroes, but all reverence must start somewhere. Obama is and forever will be the face of our people, the spirit of our nation. Every avenue will feature his face and every building will house his bust or figure in statue, for no single man is to be more respected within our borders. Obama is and forever will be the heart, the soul, the very essence of Kenya!"
KIK_militarize_kenya:0 "Kenyan Militarization"
KIK_militarize_kenya_desc:0 "The gunsmiths, factories, and assembly lines of our nation must hum alive with more energy and haste than ever before, for Kenya needs a military now more than ever. Farming tools and decades-old rifles may have been enough to earn us our independence, but we will need more than sickles and glorified muskets if we are to truly liberate all those who answer the call of our Pan-Afrikan dream. We will blacken the skies and bore deep into the earth of our Totalist Eden, sullying it if we must, for smog and debris can be cleared just as easily as the dead once our homeland is safe!"
KIK_march_on_mittelafrikas_rotting_corpse:0 "March on Mittelafrika’s Rotting Corpse!"
KIK_march_on_mittelafrikas_rotting_corpse_desc:0 "The rotted and petulant corpse that is Mittelafrika is a dead-man-walking; its days numbered as it shambles along on borrowed time, grinding all those that dare defy its unending hunger into its insatiable, greed-fueled maw. It is our duty, our destiny, to eradicate this cancerous and hedonistic hive of scum and villainy from the earth, cleansing this hallowed continent of this imperialist filth. We march for Dar-Es-Salaam, for all of Africa!"
KIK_obama_juche:0 "Kenyan Self-Sufficiency"
KIK_obama_juche_desc:0 "Kenya needs no others, for we have all we need to survive here within the Cradle of Humanity. This veritable and expansive Eden we call home shall become a beacon of self-sufficiency as we seal ourselves off from the outside world, becoming the true Red Spot of Africa. Besides, whatever we can not find within our highlands and valleys, we can find elsewhere on this expansive continent, for all of Africa is truly and rightfully ours!"
KIK_black_internationale:0 "Black Internationalism"
KIK_black_internationale_desc:0 "The African Diaspora is massive, with millions of true sons and daughters of this continent being strewn across both the Old World and the New. We must rectify this horrific situation by creating our own Internationale, an Internationale for the true and original proletariat: the Black race. Linking together elements within Europe, the Black Belt of the United States, the Carribean, across South America, and beyond, we shall reconnect with these lost siblings, forging stronger bonds as we breach the chains of our oppression, finally and together!"
KIK_divine_leader:0 "The Divine Leader"
KIK_divine_leader_desc:0 "Mzee Obama is a titanic figure, evolving well past the point of being a mere man or mortal - he has become an idea. Obama stands over the people of Kenya, and of Africa, as a demigod; a near-mythical being of untold influence and control over the souls. Obama has risen to become an avatar of anti-imperialism and Totalism itself, channeling the hate that has accumulated throughout these long centuries of oppression into a physical and effective political and cultural movement. The Grand Mzee has become the soul of Africa itself as he champions to free every last true child of this ‘Dark’ Continent."

For Kinyaa!"

KIK_remove_anglos_desc:0 "For too long the Anglos have festered and eaten away at our homeland, from their greedy over-farming of the White Highlands to their monopolization of everything from the balance of power to our coffee industry, these imperialist dogs have barked their last cries for mercy or reproach, for under Mathenge, justice will finally be served!"
KIK_kikuyu_revival:0 "Traditional Revival"
KIK_kikuyu_revival_desc:0 "With the sovereignty of the varied Kenyan peoples finally secured, Mzee Mathenge has decreed that a cultural renewal of the traditional practices lost under the rule of the mzungu, with a specific emphasis being placed on Kikuyu culture and other Bantu-descendents above the other tribal ethnicities of Kenya. Under this initiative, traditional Kenyan religions, culture, cuisine, dialects, and more shall all be revived and spread throughout the state in an attempt to stamp out colonialist influence, with no culture being more championed and publicized by the state than traditional Kikuyu practices."

KIK_kikuyu_supremacy_desc:0 "As the largest of the Kenyan tribal ethnic groups, as well as being Mathenge’s own bloodline, pro-Kikyuku sentiment will be spread far and wide. Aided by the state, our regime will ensure that the clearly superior Kikuyu dialect, religion, and cultural practices all become beloved and standard across the nation; even if that means other, lesser cultures must be squashed to make room for the Kikuyu’s rightful dominance. To start, we can begin ‘ignoring’ lesser non-Bantu groups within our borders, instead showing them the light of Kikuyu culture."

KIK_help_farmers_desc:0 "The Mau-Mau rebellion was birthed in the hearts of angry and oppressed farmers, angered over how the Anglo and Hunnic settlers long sullied the White Highlands: the most fertile of Kenya’s agriculturally-ready land. With their departure and our ascendance, we must undo these wrongs and finally appease the long-angered Kenyan farmer. Pastoral lands will be returned to the families they were stolen from, while new plots shall be sold and distributed to those who have proven their loyalty to Mathenge and the new Kinyaan state, for we shall not make the same mistake and let unworthy hands work our precious soils."

With the tragic passing of the Founder, Kimathi stands alone as the last hope of a Kenya molder in Obama’s image. Now serving as father to not only the orphaned son of the late Mzee but to the entire Kenyan nation as well, it is up to Kimathi to take up the reigns of a fallen god in order to save his people and the ideals of his mentor."

These tactics shall be adapted and emulated by a new generation of Liberian soldiers, all trained in the use of modern motorized vehicles and other forms of fast locomotion and relocation, in order to create a new breed of lightning-fast war here in Africa - one to outpace the slow machinations and movements of the remaining imperialist powers."

The white man covered in a shemagh simply and calmly replied back, “Do you know where your boss is?” Before long the platoon commander of Ngure unit came up, “So do you have it?” “Right I do, the convoy is coming up soon, here’s your next target.” He said, throwing a packet to the platoon leader. After the horsemen rode off the platoon followed down the trail to where a stopped convoy was. Soon white men came out and began loading into the last truck. “Good luck with your little rebellion, Mate! You’ll need it!” The man said waving his hand as they drove away. At this moment Ngure questioned his Platoon leader, “Why are taking arms from the white devils?” and then the leader replied back with venom, “Who are you to question what our leader Obama mandated!

Staring out at the horizon, he beholds the vast expanse of the land around him, this cradle of humankind and birthplace of our species. A land so pure and diverse in its life, with jungles deep and mystifying and mountaintops that stab into the sky, desperate to touch the gods above. This wondrous land is the birthright of all men and women on this green Earth, and yet this very moment a perverse and twisted force rapes and pillages these lands for profit, greed, and selfish personal gain: the Europeans. These pasty-faced demons lie and deceive with their promises of civilization and progress and yet the land weeps under their every move and the people of Kenya suffer for it. They are downtrodden and abused, oppressed under harsh conditions, forced to toil and slave away just to have it be stolen away in the markets of the White Man. No. No longer, Obama thought to himself as he broke from his trance, staring at the blood-red sunrise as his thoughts took flight. He knew what he had to do. He and his Mau-Mau guerillas would free Kenya and cleanse this filth from these primordial lands. With the light of Totalism guiding them as the light of the dawn had guided his journey up the mountain, Obama knew he would not falter in this fight.

Obama quickly got off the horse and onto his own and rode in front of his men. “Comrades! These seem to be our final days!” The men chant ‘The Mau-Maus will never end!’ for several times before Obama got them to quit it, “Over these past years I have learned that change can only come from the bottom-up for the oppressed peoples of Africa! We Mau-Maus have built a model community that served to make the people’s lives better!” The men were ecstatic, readied, and willing to die for Obama. Obama quietly orders them into the formation Fitzgerald had taught them in the days before this battle. With a single word- interrupted by the only White Man trusted by Obama and Kimathi,F Scott Fitzgerald. “So you’ve decided to stick with us! The Germans will have you hanged and quartered like the rest of us!” Shouted Obama to the journalist that had once been their prisoner. “These past few months I have been your brother! Let me ride with my brothers one more time!” Fitzgerald said to Obama and his men. “Then ride with us!

The fighting was some of the bloodiest Africa had seen breaking the Mau-Maus back sending them fleeing to Mau Forest and the Mountains of Kenya. This wouldn’t be the end for them, too many have escaped to fight the Germans another day.\nObama badly wounded from the charge managed to find himself at the horse ranch where they had prepared that attack. He hid inside it’s barn trying to lay low until he could escape back to men. Sadly enough the Germans weren’t as stupid as he thought. Soon a whole platoon had gathered, he knew this was going to happen. He didn’t want to believe it. Shame he had to disappoint Dedan, his most loyal follower, but hopefully he’ll take charge of the moment as he made him promise to do. It was time Obama was ready to meet his final doom. Before he would meet his end he was determined to bring down as many as he could drawing his C-96 he fired off multiple shots he knew he hit, but he didn’t know how many had died. A SMLE took him into his next life martyred by the oppressors of Africa for freedom for all of Africa.\nThe two ran somehow managing to escape that massacre. Before long Obama had to stop running to catch his breath that took some cover before long Dedan spoke to him, “So is this how we plan to end? Dying in some forgotten town.” Dedan angrily said at him Obama quickly replied back. “Everything's coming together...exactly as I’ve planned.” Dedan merely was confused, “How the hell is coming together!

At 14:00 yesterday (at the time of this report) the Mau-Maus used horses taken from an English Settler Ranch, (said Settler had been dead since the start of the uprising), and conducted a final charge upon us. Despite surprisingly overwhelming our lines when they’ve gotten to our back line we’d set up several maxims and had them mowed down. There were also reports of a white man among them, but no one among the defense forces was able to confirm this. It was possible he was able to escape after the carnage that was the cavalry charge. Obama was confirmed to have escaped his failed attempt at victory. Found in a barn he attempted to shoot his way out is belived to have been shot dead, not before killing 5 and wounding 2. We have so-far been unable to find Obama's body, despite the men who went to after him confiriming his death. Hopefully with his death we’ll be able to deal with the remains of what's left of this annoying rebellion.

Let me tell you something — there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.\n\n If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable Kenyan system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The telegraph didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the telegraph so that all the companies could make money off the telegraph.\n\n The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires. \n\n So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we'll free Kenya. That’s how we'll defeat the Hun! That’s how we'll a build a Totalist Nation! That’s how we'll free all of Africa!

Markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable, and millions of Kenyans will open up their wallets this week and see that so much of their hard-earned cash has disappeared.	760,000 workers have lost their jobs this week alone. Unemployment here in Kenya 85% over the last eight years, which is the highest it's been in sixteen years. You've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs, the typical Kenyan family has seen their income fall $25, and it's getting harder and harder to make the rent, or fill up your stomach, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just are you better off than you were four years ago?, it's are you better off than you were four weeks ago? \n\n We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century the Kenyan century. \n\n But it will take a new direction. It will take new leadership in Nairobi. It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last years.  \n\n Over the course of the Bush War, I've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle-class and strengthen our economy in the long-term. I'll reform our tax code so that 95% of workers and their families get a tax cut, and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $50,000. I'll bring down the cost of healthcare for families and businesses by investing in preventative care, new technology, and giving every Kenyan the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of the Colonial Authority  give themselves. We'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go. We'll create five million new, high-wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the Middle East in ten years, and we'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools and bridges. It's a serious challenge. But we can do it if we act now, and if we act as one nation. We can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to Kenya and to Nairobi.  \n\n Together, we cannot fail. Not now. Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save. Not when there are so many Kenyans without jobs and without homes. Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor, or send their child to college, or pay their bills at the end of the month. Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves. \n\n Now it falls to us. Together, we cannot fail! Together, we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eighty years! Together, we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class! Together, we can create millions of new jobs,  and deliver on the promise of healthcare you can afford and education that helps your kids compete! We can do this if we come together, if we have confidence in ourselves and each other, if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead. Together, we can change this country and change this world. Thank you, and remember, Only Totalism and Only I can lead Kenya to freedom!”"

But there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military have achieved.\n\n And so I want to be very clear: We are fighting to do away with the Hun – and we will do that. We will leave the Kenyan people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life – that is your achievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible. \n\n There are many lessons to be learned from what we’ve experienced. We have learned that the Mau-Mau must go to war with clearly defined goals.. We have learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the Kenyan people. We have learned that in the 20th century, we must use all elements of Kenyan power to achieve our objectives, which is why I am committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed on to our military. We have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support that our national security policies depend upon, which is why I will consult with no other man when carrying out my plans. And we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we are launching a new era of engagement in the Bush War. \n\n The starting point for our policies must alway the freedom of the Kenyan people. I know that you – the men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world – can meet any challenge, and defeat any foe. And as your Commander-in-Chief, I promise you that I will only send you into harm’s way when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get the job done. That is the most important lesson of all – for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable. \n\n You know because you have seen those sacrifices. You have lived them. And we all honor them. \n\n Each Kenyan who has served with the Mau-Mau has their own story. Each of you has your own story. And that story is now a part of the history of the Kenyan people– a people that exists only because free men and women have bled for it from the beaches to the deserts. From the mountains to the street. You teach us that the price of freedom is great. Your sacrifice should challenge all of us – every single Kenyan – to ask what we can do to be better citizens. \n\n There will be more danger in the months ahead. We will face new tests and unforeseen trials. But thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged hard-earned progress, we WILL drive the Hun from this land and we shall have peace! \n\n Thank you, and may the Light of Totalism lead us to victory!”"

We lie in our rocky fortresses and desert dens trapped like a cornered fox in its lair, ready to lash out and strike at any who would dare try to divorce us from our lands. \nOur brave leader, the grand Mzee Onyango Obama, guides our infantile insurrection the best he can, shepherding our flock as we constantly take flight from the ever pursuing Kenyan Frontier Forces.

With Mittelafrika's inevitable collapse and the rising of Obama from the dead, the people of Kenya can finally breath free, knowing that the forces of the Mau-Mau have finally emerged victories after nearly two decades of war, and saved them from the imperialist dogs of the Anglo and Hunnic empires. However, with that victory comes the beginnings of division among the ranks of the Mau-Mau.\n\nDuring the neigh three year period of Obama's absence, Dedan Kimathi did his best to keep the Mau-Mau united, until such time has Barrack come of age, when he could follow in his father's footsteps to become the salvation of Kenya. However Kimathi was no Obama, lacking his former mentor's charisma and natural leadership. While a good leader in his own right, Kimathi was never able to fit into the enormous shoes of Obama. This lack of strong leadership inevitably lead to the rise of divisions within the Mau-Mau's ranks, mostly centered around the highly nationalistic and Bantu revivalist Stanley Mathenge. While never outright challenging Dedan's leadership, it was clear that he would be idle once victory was finally won. When Obama suddenly reappeared, once more claiming leadership over the Mau-Mau, Mathenge quickly fell in line, although still clearly harboring his own ideas for the future of Kenya. With victory over Imperialist forces finally won and the Mau-Mau at peace for the first time since it's creation, Mathenge has made his move, using several loyalist units to try and capture the capital and with it, Obama, the man in his way too power.\n\n As fighting around [KIK.Capital.GetName] heats up, Mathenge has been able to breach Obama's compouned. Just as Mathenge is able to breach Obama's office, a flash of gunfire hails into and out from the room.

Rising above it all, threatening to pierce the sky itself, stood Mount Kenya. On this mountain, years ago, Obama, Kimathi, Mathenge, and many others first congregated, swearing loyalty to one another as they both birthed the KLFA and sparked the fire of the Mau-Mau Revolution to life. \n\nNow, Mzee Obama sat alone at its peak, meditating on his people’s victory and the coming trials ahead, or so he thought... \n\nFor all his victories and triumphs, Obama still held one great failure in his heart: the loss of his student’s respect, for of his two proteges, one had grown long tired of Obama’s empty platitudes and haughty proselytizing. Stanley Mathenge, once heir apparent to the Mau-Mau in Obama’s absence, had long fallen second to Dedan Kimathi, current second-in-command and near-son of the Grand Mzee, over Mathenge’s own prediction for more traditionalist and nationalist views on most of the issues the KLFA has faced. With these disagreements having formed a schism between these titans of Kenyan political affairs, Mathenge’s bitterness and resentment over his former master has long festerd and grown, and now he stalks his aging mentor like a jaguar hunting its prey. \n\nAs Obama sits in meditation, listening to his inner thoughts as the howling winds of this stormy peak clear his mind, and conceal his would-be assassin’s tracks, Mathenge has slowly crept up the mountaintop and now stands just meters from the Grand Mzee’s tranquil form. As the young firebrand began to step forward, however, a twig snapped under his footfall, a blunder forced on by his over-eager readiness to strike, alerted the prophet, who immediately leaped to his feet, drawing his knife and readying his counter to Mathenge’s rush. Within moments, the two titans were at each other's throats, exchanging slashes and jabs in a fierce display of force as they battled for the spirit and future of Kenya itself. \n\nAs the the fight dragged on and the howling winds turned into a torrential storm, these two demigods of Kenyan idealism were close to exhaustion as their battle drew nearer to its end. In one final effort, both warriors charge each other, with the winner proving to be whomever could draw their blade the quickest. \n\nIn a flash that struck with the rolling thunder and lighting of this alpine storm, blood was drawn and a body fell.

Kimathi had been on assignment at the Ethiopian border, as the Imperial Army was allegedly mobilizing in reaction to the Mau-Mau's victory. With word of Obama's second and true death spreading like wildfire, Kimathi has resolved to avenge Obama, and if possible rescue his son who was reportedly captured by Mathenge. As Kimathi rides on towards the captial, he is reminded of the last time he saw Obama, before his first death, making his resolve all the stronger.

And now, as our state gears up for war yet again to reclaim some long forgotten or long lost strip of jungle and sand, we shall know war once again. This harsh, blood-stained reality must be known to all Kenyans, for it is this struggle, this harsh and painful reality, that has given us the gift of freedom. Without war, without sacrifice, without the screams of death, our nation and our people would be naught but ash and blood splattered across the rocky peaks of Mount Kenya. It has become a comfort to our people; the sounds of artillery fire and the smell of gunpowder are but mere lullabies to our battle-hardened and steel-eyed people. This has been the reality of our birth, and shall be the reality of our continued life, for if our guard were to drop for even a moment, we would be beset upon by the unknowable wolves who stalk us like lambs waiting for slaughter.

Though Kenya holds a decent amount of its own industry, our main connection to the wider world has been destroyed, for with Uganda’s departure, they took with them our connection to the failed Cape-to-Cairo Railway. \n\nConnecting into Ugandan land at the border town of Malaba, the railway carried goods up to the Mediterranean, bypassing the Suez Canal - an avenue we sorely need access to now given our hostile stance to the Kaiserreich. Though this route is not our only access to friendly nations and markets, due to our naval access to the Bharatiya Commune through our ports on the Indian Ocean, it is the most lucrative and most important as open access to the Internationale may prove useful. Until we are in a position to either retake the Ugandan railways or hash out a deal with the Germans over canal usage rights, we must instead build new rail lines to the far North of our nation, bypassing Uganda and instead laying track directly into Sudan’s southern reaches to reach their rail center in Wau. With these new rails, our lifeline to the major Socialist powers will be secured, allowing us to access the international market while bypassing the Germans and their stranglehold over the Suez Canal."

Among the most fertile of our land lies within the now infamous White Highlands, a section of Kenya's mountainous, rugged terrain within the central uplands that surround the city of Nyeri. \n\nFor decades, Anglo and then Kraut colonizers and settlers have raped and defiled the land, draining the soil of its natural fertility within years of their arrival while for centuries before them, pastoralists like the Kikuyu and the Maasai tended to this pristine eden without issue. In their hands, the land was nurtured and cared for, while in the hands of the maniacal Europeans, Kenya has instead been led to ruin. The European’s, in their impatient ‘civilizing’ efforts, have caused a fertility crisis on a scale we have never seen before and in doing so, have ushered in a terrible famine upon our people as they relieved themselves on exports from Berlin. Luckily, their reign has been toppled and these issues can finally be faced. \n\nWith the triumphs of the KLFA and the return of this land to our skilled farmers’ hands, the White Highlands will be restored to its former glory, healed of the greed-fueled damage the imperialist dogs have wrought upon it. Only true, knowledgeable Kenyan farmers shall work these hallowed lands now, and by their hand the White Highlands shall slowly be revitalized."

Untold centuries later, we stand here in Kenya as their descendents and heir to their civilization-spreading legacy. Surrounded by lesser Nilotic and Afroasiatic savages, our greatness is constantly beset and dragged down by the vermin who we are forced to share our borders with. To alleviate the stress and grievances our people deal with as a result of sharing their living space with these savages, a slew of pro-Bantu legislations shall be passed, further reviving and emphasizing Bantu culture while uplifting groups like the mighty Kikuyu and their less-numerous cousins in the Kisii, Kamba, Meru, and the Mijikenda above the station of their non-Bantu compatriots. Even the Arab-blodded half-breeds that are the Swahili tribes shall be granted some semblance of higher rights and privileges over the non-Bantu savages, leaving groups like the Maasai and the Arabs to wallow rightfully at the bottom of our new hierarchy. The Age of the Bantu has returned to Kenya, and all those not of our ancestor’s blood shall face justice for their crimes and sleights against our pure and noble peoples, for this is but the first step to our resurgence!."

They still, despite all of our previous efforts at ‘peaceful’ negotiations, have proven to be a thorn in the side of our new regime, resisting our rule at every turn. These non-Bantus are many in number and plague our lands like rats and roaches, sapping away our propensity for prosperity as they leech off our national pride and success. From foreigners like the Arabs and Afroasiatics to the Nilotic and Oromo groups like the Maasai, Waata, Bajuuni, or Okiek, these false-Kenyans have squandered our potential and stabbed our people in the back too many times - this treachery and deceit ends now. \n\n To combat this, a final solution has been concocted to crush these ungrateful tribals once and for all. Under the orders of Mzee Mathenge, the KLFA shall march into the villages and towns of these pastoralists and hunter-gatherers, rounding up the compliant and useful into groups to be sent off to labor camps while any troublemakers or would-be heroes and headaches shall be dealt with in a far more direct and efficient manner. Though the international community may be displeased if they ever catch wind of our actions here, they are far too busy fighting amongst themselves to ever pay mind to a few thousand missing savages.

While he clearly helped cultivated this cult of personality, he also never publicly addressed it. In speeches, he would indeed mention how he alone could save Kenya, and with it all of Africa, however he touched on the subject of his neigh divine status.\n\nThat has all changed today, following an official proclamation pronounced from Obama's headquarters atop Mt. Kenya. Mount Kenya has always been viewed by the people of Kenya as the very embodiment of the land, even sometimes as a god itself. It was said that the gods themselves could oft be found atop it's majestic peaks, waiting to commune with man. Taking advantage of this, Obama, in his proclamation, declared himself the very Spirit of the Mountain. In doing so, he has declared himself nothing short of a literal god, or at least a demigod. Despite the majority of his supporters, himself included, being Christian, Obama has proclaimed his godhood in a manner as to not cause offense to any of Kenya's faithful. He may be a god, or a wielder of great power, but he is still below and most obey the supreme Triune God of Christianity. He also outlined how, once his mortal life was over, the Spirit of the Mountain would be transferred too his son, Barrack. Once Barrack had died, his son would inherit the Spirit, ad infinitum until there was no longer a male descent of Obama.\n\nReactions to this announcement have been mixed to say the least. Within the Mau-Mau and Africa at large, it has been seen as a statement of what is already the case. Outside of Africa, this move has either been mocked, condemned or simply ignored. Regardless, Obama has truly earned his place in history."

redkenya.16.d:0 "News was also slow coming to the Mau-Mau during the First Great Uprising. While of course this comes with the nature of a geurilla fighting force, one piece of news that would eventually make it to the ears of the Mau-Mau was the creation and sighing of the Totalist Charter. Obama had always been fascinated with the various proto-Totalist ideologies that floated around the world since he first encountered them during his short period of exile in Egypt. When he learned that these White Men, the very embodiment of evil and all that is wrong with the world, had formalized what he had been leading and teaching the Mau-Mau, he made a mental note that once the revolution was over, and the Mau-Mau stood victorious, he would do all he could to reach out to others who preached a similar Totalism and call them to our captial and correct a great mistake. With Kenya finally pacified and the KLFA preparing to march on the rest of Mittleafrika, the time has finally come to enact what could amount to a second meeting like that which produced the Totalist Charter.\n\nWhile very few actually heeded Obama's call to meet, quite a few were indeed able to make it to the captial. Among the more interesting visitors to the capital is none other then Chief New Moon, an esoteric Totalist who wishes to bath the New World red in the blood of the White Man to create a true paradise for the Red Man, his name for the indigenous people of the Americas. At first meeting, Obama and New Moon hardly got on, but as time went on, the two have become neigh inseparable. However, the most important visitor to Kenya has been one Oswald Mosley, the very face of Charter Totalism. Despite his obvious whiteness, Mosley and Obama quickly kicked off, becoming quite close friends.\n\nThe meeting in the captial was a surprisingly quick affair, with all present declaring their loyalty to the truest and purest form of Leftism. Just as the meeting was wrapping up, Mosley produced a document. That document was none other then the original Totalist Charter, which he invited every man present to sign. The first to do so was Obama, followed by New Moon. While this is a very small gesture, it has done much to legitimize so-called Esoteric Totalism as a real and official offshoot of Charter Totalism as a whole. With the meeting concluded, all have parted ways, with new friends made by all present."

With Obama's sudden reappearance and final victory over Kenya, he has finally truly had the time to be a father to his son.\n\nWhile Obama has only had a few fleeting moments with Barrack due to his status as our leader, he has begun to teach him the ways of leadership, preparing him for his inheritance. The young Barrack has reportedly taken quite well to his father's lessons, so much so that Obama has granted his young son a small amount of political power, as head of the Electrical and Water Treatment Bureau, a position he is quickly growing into.

Based heavily on other such Industrial Cities in America and Europe, these new cities, shall bring finally bring the Industry and jobs that have so long been absent on the Dark Continent.

With each passing minute, Jomo only grew more anxious, wide-eyed, and feral in his fear as the terror squads of the Mau-Mau and their path of utter destruction reached him; their pure, unyielding hatred for the man that betrayed The Great Leader and everything the Mau-Mau and the Kenyan people hold dear when he bent the knee to the foreingn colonizers.  \n\nIt was decades ago, after the fires of the Weltkrieg, when Kenyatta departed from the Young Kikuyus and the predecessor organizations that birthed our rebellion. Though he claimed it was to find a peaceful way for our people and all African people to be free, we know better. Kenyatta is a liar and a scoundrel that abandoned our infantile movement to save his own skin as he languished under the imperialist yoke beside us. Well, this day, he shall receive his well-earned justice! \n\nWith the sounds of the maelstrom that unfolded outside his final bastion subsiding, Jomo breathed a sigh of relief, believing, if even just for a second, his troops were victorious. Then all hope faded in a flash of white phosphorus and hellfire. After seconds that felt like millenia, Kenyatta opened his eyes after a cacophony of noise, light, and vitriolic chemicals drowned out his senses and blocked the world from his perception, shocked only to see the bloodied, mutilated corpses of his loyal askari guard strewn about the shack he had decided to make this ‘valiant’ last stand. \n\nThen, in a flash, it was over. Without a final, grandiose speech or apology, without even a final word, the leading Mau Mau guerilla stepped forward before Kenyatta even could clearly make sense of his newly demolished surroundings and decapitated the traitorous snake in one quick action - a far too quick a death for this scum.

Many journalists from many nations attempted to get a word in with Mathenge, the new ambitious leader of Kenya. Yet for all the attempts only he got in, something the Journalist had to think came from his native birth in a Kikuyu tribe. The journalist sat down with Mathenge, preparing to write down everything he said, Mathenge even organizing the journalist to have one of the few recorders in Kenya for this interaction.\n\nIt went on slowly, until finally the journalist prepared to ask a more controversial question. “Why did you kill Obama?” He asked Mathenge. Mathenge smiled as if this was the question he was awaiting to reveal his motives for. “Obama did not share the dream of the Kikuyu people, no he never cared for us. I wished to reawaken the Bantu dream, and I got what I wanted,`` he said as he raised his hands to show right to the journalist. “Why do you think I killed him myself?”. Mathenge leaned back with a smile and took a swig from his champagne, as the journalist took the time to digest his question."

redkenya.26.d:0 "Though our revolution successful, with all of Kenya and Africa under our glorious rule, many have called for Barrack Obama Sr. to finally step down in favour of his radical son of the same name. Barrack Sr.'s rule has been one of stagnation for the People's state with many questioning his almost mythical status. The Young Obama has also critiqued this as well, claiming his father is unfit to rule the country as of current and that he alone can bring back Hope to the Mau-Mau as his grandfather did all those years ago. Recently, posters have begun being spread throughout the capital of our state with words like "Hope" and "Yes We Can!" plastered over the Young Obama's face. The situation has now reached a boiling point with both side's supporters actively fighting in the streets, threatening to collapse the state their grandfather fought to create all those years ago."
