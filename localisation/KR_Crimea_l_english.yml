crm.1.t:0 "Modern Crimean History"
crm.1.d:0 "The Crimean Peninsula has been a fusion of many cultures and nationalities since ancient times, including Greeks, Romans, Khazars, Polovtsians, Genoese, and finally, Russians, Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars.\n\nThe modern history of Crimea begins in 1917, when, in the wake of revolutionary events in Russia, the first Turkic republic, the Crimean People's Republic, appeared on the fragments of a once great empire. The elected Kurultai of the Crimean Tatars proclaimed the independence of the Crimean state, but soon after that the island was conquered by Bolshevik-minded forces who were able to hold power for only a few months. Nevertheless, during these few months, a terrible red terror broke out in Crimea, which claimed the lives of many people.\n\nIn June 1918, the peninsula was occupied by the Kaiser's troops and power passed to the pro-German Crimean Regional Government under the leadership of Suleiman Sulkevich. All government activities were under the full control of the occupation command. In July 1918, a government delegation visited Berlin in order to achieve recognition by the German government of the independence of Crimea from Ukraine, to receive loans from it and establish trade relations with Germany. Behind the scenes, the German government was also offered a memorandum by the Crimean Tatar Directory on the creation of the Crimean Khanate under the patronage of Germany and Turkey. However, these proposals did not receive support in Berlin.\n\nCrimea's relations with the Skoropadsky government initially did not work out. In September - October, the Crimean-Ukrainian negotiations were held in Kiev, at which the Ukrainian delegation proposed that Crimea become part of Ukraine on the rights of extremely broad autonomy. The Crimean delegation made a counter-proposal: the creation of a federal union. Unfortunately, it was not possible to come to an agreement, and as a result, by the end of the year, Crimea became fully part of Hetman Ukraine. Sulkevich's government resigned, and the new one under the leadership of Solomon Krym announced the creation of the government of the Crimean Republic in exile. Despite the presence of occupation troops, anarchist and Bolshevik forces continued sabotage and terror, until the end of the war, when the territory of the whole of Ukraine was completely liberated from all red scum.\n\nThus, since 1919, Crimea has been under the full authority of the Hetmanate, and despite a small autonomy for the local population, it underwent Ukrainization in the 1920s. Now that Hetman Ukraine is in a protracted crisis, the government in exile has returned to give the peoples inhabiting Crimea their legitimate territories."
crm.1.a:0 "Ant Etkenmen!"

crm.2.t:0 "The Divided Peninsula"
crm.2.d:0 "Crimea is inhabited by various peoples, but in general, the 4 most numerous stand out: Russians, who make up about 40% of the population, Ukrainians, who make up about 30%, Crimean Tatars, who make up about 20%, as well as Crimeans, Karaites and others.\n\nNow the government of Solomon Krym, which has supreme authority over the peninsula, in fact represents only 20% of the population, while the Russian majority, the Ukrainian and Jewish minorities are alienated from the governance of the state. Despite the fact that the Government declares the freedom of expression of the will of the people immediately after the acquisition of sovereignty by the peninsula, their true intentions are questioned.\n\nRussian Russian majority, at the same time, is in some political isolation, as it does not border with Russia either by land or by sea, and is surrounded either by the water or by anti-Russian-minded countries. In addition, there is no significant political organization in Crimea that defends the rights of Russians.\n\nHowever, the Karaite minority stands out in particular - the Turkic population, which professes one of the currents of Judaism. The leader of their community is Gahan Seraya Shapshal, known for his eccentric statements and unhealthy interest in the history of the Khazar Khaganate."
crm.2.a:0 "Interesting"

crm.3.t:0 "Local Insurgency in the Crimea!"
crm.3.d:0 "Local clashes with the Hetman's army, as well as protests against the King and the Hetman, began among the local population in Crimea, mainly Crimean Tatars. Minorities who are dissatisfied with the agricultural crisis, inflation and, in general, our policy demand bread, lower taxes and higher wages. Despite the fact that our economy cannot afford extra expenses now, we can try to avoid further conflict and reduce taxes for Crimeans and hope that this will calm the population."
crm.3.a:0 "Suppress the insurgency!"
crm.3.b:0 "Ease the tax burden for Crimeans."

crm.4.t:0 "Solomon Krym Returns to the Crimea"
crm.4.d:0 "We have received information that Solomon Krym, the so-called leader of the "government of the Crimean People's Republic in exile" illegally crossed the border with our country and somehow penetrated into Crimea, probably from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSolomon Krym was one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar national movement, being in opposition to the first Crimean regional government of Sulkevich. Before the Civil War, he headed an agricultural society in the Crimea and did a lot for the development of horticulture and viticulture of the region. He participated in many charitable foundations, founded scholarships, financed the activities of the Karadag scientific Station, archaeological excavations on the peninsula and publishing activities.\n\nAfter Sulkevich's Crimean republic was absorbed by Ukraine, Solomon Crimea declared himself the new prime minister and founded a government in exile, remaining its undisputed leader all these years. Now he's in Crimea, and we should probably expect separatist unrest on the peninsula."
crm.4.a:0 "We must find him before he could rally people"

crm.5.t:0 "Separatism in Crimea"
crm.5.d:0 "As expected, upon arriving on the peninsula, Solomon Crimea began actively promoting separatism and the national independence of the Crimean Tatars. His speech in Bakhchisarai gathered a large rally, and many began to arm themselves against our government, seizing towns and villages.\n\nIt is urgently necessary to restore order in the region, but for this it is proposed to introduce martial law in the entire Tauride District, as well as prepare the Black Sea Fleet either for evacuation or for the suppression of a separatist uprising.\n\nOleksandr Rogoza, an outstanding Ukrainian military commander, was appointed temporary governor of the Tauride district and responsible for suppressing the Crimean uprising."
crm.5.a:0 "Send our best general to deal with crisis."

crm.6.t:0 "Tavria Okruha"
crm.6.d:0 "So, a curfew and martial law were imposed throughout the Tauride district, Oleksandr Rogoza arrived in the district with an armed division in order to suppress the uprising.\n\nBy this time, the militias were able to establish control over almost the entire peninsula, with the exception of some individual parts with a Ukrainian majority and Sevastopol.\n\nGeneral Rogoza will have to seize the Isthmus of Perekop and, with the help of the Black Sea Fleet, regain control of the peninsula, arrest Solomon Krym and suppress the separatist uprising."
crm.6.a:0 "Oleksandr Rogoza will deal with the insurgency."
crm.6.b:0 "The separatism should be destroyed! (Play as Tavria Okruha)"
crm.6.c:0 "Down with Ukrainians! (Play as Independent Crimea)"

crm.7.t:0 "Perekop Shaft"
crm.7.d:0 "We need to gain a foothold on the Perekop Isthmus and successfully counterattack General Rogoza's divisions. While we have some time to prepare, we can strengthen the ancient Perekopsky rampart - a defensive structure consisting of a deep moat in order to gain a firm foothold on the peninsula and switch attention to Sevastopol, hoping to seize control of the city - and, first of all, over the fleet.\n\nOn the other hand, we can abandon attempts to reconstruct the ancient rampart and switch all the main attention to Sevastopol, leaving a small garrison on the isthmus, which can easily repel the attacks of the Ukrainian army. This plan is more risky, but if we win, we will be able to capture Sevastopol and part of the Black Sea Fleet."
crm.7.a:0 "Use the shaft to defent the peninsula."
crm.7.b:0 "Try to conquer Sevastopol!"

crm.8.t:0 "Rogoza's Army Has Been Repulsed"
crm.8.d:0 "Alexander Rogoza's army reached the isthmus fairly quickly, but our efforts to strengthen the moat contributed to the fact that we successfully repelled the attacks of the Ukrainian army and were even able to counterattack, pushing deeper into the mainland.\n\nAt the same time, we missed the Black Sea fleet, the main part of which left Sevastopol Bay, and the other firmly entrenched in the city, allowing the landing of additional Ukrainian divisions. The approaches to Sevastopol are blocked, and it seems that now we will not be able to recapture the city."
crm.8.a:0 "We lost the fleet!"

crm.9.t:0 "Sevastopol Captured!"
crm.9.d:0 "Due to the fact that we spent most of our forces on the capture of Sevastopol, we were able to successfully attack the Black Sea fleet and capture some of the ships along with the sailors who defected to our side.\n\nDespite the fact that part of the fleet was able to evacuate, the city is now under the full control of the Crimean Tatar forces. However, we paid the price, as Rogoza's army was able to break through the Perekop Isthmus and seize the initiative in the Northern Crimea. Before it's too late, we need to strengthen our positions there and organize an effective defense against the Ukrainian army."
crm.9.a:0 "Reinforce Northern Crimea as soon as possible!"

crm.10.t:0 "The Battle for the Northern Crimea"
crm.10.d:0 "The Ukrainian military successfully occupied the Perekop isthmus and gained a foothold in the northern Crimea. Now we have to decide on our further actions. One of the options is to protect our key cities - Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, with the loss of which our uprising will be doomed to failure. On the other hand, we can try to capture Perekop and surround the enemy - a more risky, but effective plan, since if we win, we will break up large enemy detachments."
crm.10.a:0 "Defend Simferopol and Bakhchisarai"
crm.10.b:0 "Try to regain control over Perekop and surround enemy."

crm.11.t:0 "Simferopol and Bakhchisarai Have Fallen"
crm.11.d:0 "The Ukrainian army was able to outwit us and, while we were trying to encircle it, attacked the almost unprotected Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, gaining a foothold in the cities and hanging their flags there. Without these cities, our uprising quickly descended into a partisan movement, which was also soon defeated. We lost."
crm.11.a:0 "Victory of the Ukrainian Forces!"

crm.12.t:0 "Simferopol and Bakhchisarai Defended!"
crm.12.d:0 "We were able to defend Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, successfully repelling enemy attacks, and proving that our armed forces, despite their unprofessional nature, can be effective. The war has reached a point where neither side can attack effectively. We have lost the Northern Crimea, but we have preserved key and strategically important facilities and cities."
crm.12.a:0 "It seems the war has reached stalemate."

crm.13.t:0 "Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
crm.13.d:0 "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Berlin to ask for mediation in negotiations with [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula, official recognition of their independence by Ukraine, and first of all, Germany, as a leading world power.\n\nOn the one hand, we can support the Crimean Tatar independence in exchange for the deployment of our overseas divisions in Crimea, as well as preferential terms for German companies.\n\nOn the other hand, it will undoubtedly definitely harm our relations with Ukraine and we may lose not only an important economic partner, but also encourage Ukraine to ally with Russia."
crm.13.a:0 "We cannot loose Ukraine."
crm.13.b:0 "We must have a reliable support on the Black Sea."

crm.14.t:0 "Germany Supported Ukraine!"
crm.14.d:0 "The German government has decided to support our enemies and refused to become a mediator in negotiations between our countries. It seems that we should find another ally or cope alone."
crm.14.a:0 "1918 Repeats."

crm.15.t:0 "Germany Demands We Recognize Crimea!"
crm.15.d:0 "Our Berlin partners has approached us with a demand to recognize the Crimean government and its authority over all of Peninsula.\nDespite the fact that this is in principle a gross violation of our rights to the peninsula, it casts doubt on our further cooperation with Germany. However, we can try to negotiate the preservation of Sevastopol for us, and thus have a base on the peninsula and annex Crimea at the right moment. This will also allow the Black Sea Fleet to return to its home harbor."
crm.15.a:0 "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.15.b:0 "Demand Sevastopol base and Black Sea Fleet back."
crm.15.e:0 "Demand Sevastopol base"
crm.15.f:0 "Demand Perekop Isthmus under our control."
crm.15.c:0 "We submit to the Kaiser's will."

crm.16.t:0 "Ukraine Threatens to Leave the Reichspakt!"
crm.16.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has threatened us with leaving the Reichspakt if we do not recognize their supremacy over the entire peninsula.\n\nWe can meet them halfway and deny Crimea self-determination in order not to lose a military ally and our breadbasket, but our troops are always ready to strike and restore order in Kiev."
crm.16.a:0 "No one sets terms for Kaiserreich!"
crm.16.b:0 "We cannot lose Ukraine."

crm.17.t:0 "Germany Сoncedes"
crm.17.d:0 "The Kaiserreich showed its weakness and made concessions to Ukraine, which means we are worth something in their eyes. Due to the inability to continue an effective military campaign against Crimea, we are forced to offer them a temporary peace, but as soon as we recover, we will come for them."
crm.17.a:0 "Victory!"

crm.18.t:0 "Germany Threatens Us With Force"
crm.18.d:0 "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. Of course that means that we are on the verge of war with Reichspakt, but it worths it."
crm.18.a:0 "Khai Zhive, Zhive, Vilna Ukraina!"

crm.19.t:0 "Ukraine Demands Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet"
crm.19.d:0 "The Ukrainian government suggested that they should keep Sevastopol as their base and also demanded the Crimean government to return the parts of the Black Sea Fleet that defected. While we can clearly see what they want from it, we can concede and perhaps even force Crimean Republic to comply with these terms. That would, however, deprive us from the direct access to the Crimea and the Black Sea, but we will save our more economically developed ally."
crm.19.a:0 "Offer these terms to the Crimean government."
crm.19.b:0 "OUR terms must be accepted."

crm.20.t:0 "Germany Refused!"
crm.20.d:0 "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. We could still threaten them, or just accept their terms."
crm.20.a:0 "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.20.b:0 "Fine. We cannot risk our relations with Germans now."

crm.21.t:0 "Treaty of Berlin"
crm.21.d:0 "The German government has settled the disputes with the Ukrainian government and now has offered us the following terms of peace with Ukraine:\n\n1. [GER.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] recognize the authority of [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] over the whole Crimean Peninsula.\n2. The hostilities between [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should be over within two days inclusive. [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should withdraw its forces from the Crimean Peninsula within one month.\n3. The Perekop Isthmus shall become a demilitarized zone for 2 years.\n4.[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] should have military and naval access to the port of Sevastopol\n5. German companies should be given preferential tax and business conditions."
crm.21.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
crm.21.b:0 "It's just a dirty piece of paper!"

crm.22.t:0 "Crimean Republic Refused the Terms"
crm.22.d:0 "The Crimean Republic has refused our generous terms. It seems that now we have nothing to do but allow Ukraine to go on with their war. Only fools reject treaties from Kaiserreich!"
crm.22.a:0 "Green light for Ukraine!"

crm.23.t:0 "Green Light From Germany!"
crm.23.d:0 "The Crimean Republic has foolishly refused the Kaiser's terms. We have been given green light to go on with Crimean war, but it seems that our troops are now in a stalemate and we need more time."
crm.23.a:0 "Fools."

crm.24.t:0 "Treaty of Berlin"
crm.24.d:0 "The German government has settled the disputes with the Ukrainian government and now has offered us the following terms of peace with Ukraine:\n\n1. [GER.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] recognize the authority of [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] over the Crimean Peninsula, excluding the city of Sevastopol, which will remain a Ukrainian territory.\n2. The Black Sea Fleet defectors and ships should be returned to [UKR.GetNameDefCap].\n3. The hostilities between [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should be over within two days inclusive. [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should withdraw its forces from the Crimean Peninsula within one month.\n4. The Perekop Isthmus shall become a demilitarized zone for 2 years.\n5.

crm.30.b:0 "It's just a dirty piece of paper!"

crm.31.t:0 "Mobilise Against Crimea?"
crm.31.d:0 "It seems that nothing could help resolving the Crimean crisis peacefully. There is a stalemate on the island and we should either suggest a temporary armistice to the Crimean Government and hope to reconquer them later or outright declare war on them, mobilising all our forces."
crm.31.a:0 "Offer them armistice."
crm.31.b:0 "Declare war on them!"

crm.32.t:0 "Armistice With Ukraine"
crm.32.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has approached us with a temporary armistice, because of the stalemate. Today we have signed this treaty, though formally we are still in a state of war, we can take out time and be ready for their next strike."
crm.32.a:0 "Independence!"

crm.33.t:0 "Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
crm.33.d:0 "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Constantinople to ask for mediation in negotiations with [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nWe are united by centuries-old friendship with the Crimean Tatars, and on the one hand, we can support the independence of the Crimean Tatars, though in exchange for certain conditions. We can demand the restoration of the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of the Giray dynasty, whose representative, Sultan Kadyr Giray, chairman of the Circassian-Georgian Society, has been living in Constantinople since the 1920s. On the other hand, we can recognize the existing Republican government. We have nothing to do with Ukraine, but we cooperate with Berlin, which can put pressure on Ukraine. In any case, peace will be concluded only if the Ottoman troops enter the territory of the Crimea as defenders and protectors of the newly formed state."
crm.33.a:0 "Suggest restoration of the Khanate."
crm.33.b:0 "Support their government and demand Ukraine to withdraw."
crm.33.c:0 "We have no interest in Crimea."

crm.34.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Suggests Restoration of the Khanate"
crm.34.d:0 "In exchange for their help, the Ottomans offered to restore the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of a pretender from the Giray dynasty, Sultan Kadyr Giray, a descendant of Genghis Khan and the ruling dynasty of the Crimean Khanate.\n\nOn the one hand, this is quite fair, and the khanate restored in the format of a constitutional monarchy will strengthen our ties with the Ottoman Empire. On the other hand, some forces within our government will be against it. If we do not agree, the Ottomans may refuse to help us."
crm.34.a:0 "We agree."
crm.34.b:0 "We are a modern state, no need to return back to 1700s."

crm.35.t:0 "Crimea Refused!"
crm.35.d:0 "The Crimean government has refused to install the Khanate, insisting on our recognition of the republican rule."
crm.35.a:0 "Support their government and demand Ukraine to withdraw."
crm.35.b:0 "We have no interest in Crimea."

crm.36.t:0 "Crimea Agreed!"
crm.36.d:0 "The Crimean government has agreed to install the Khanate regime, even though the Khan will be more of a figurehead, then have any power. This is still good, as it traces us back to our old right to place the Khan of Crimea on its throne. We must send a demand to the Ukrainian government that the Crimea is now under our protection."
crm.36.a:0 "Demand they withdraw their forces!"

crm.37.t:0 "Ottoman Empire Demands to Withdraw From the Crimea!"
crm.37.d:0 "The government of the Ottoman Empire has recognized the Crimean government and became their protector, placing their troops on the peninsula. They demanded that we should withdraw our forces from the peninsula and recognize the Crimean government."

crm.38.d:0 "The Ukrainian government agreed to withdraw, but they kept the land on the peninsula they occupied previously under their direct control. The Crimean government is dissatisfied with this, demanding control over the entire peninsula.

crm.38.a:0 "Demand full withdrawal of their forces."
crm.38.b:0 "Call Berlin."

crm.39.t:0 "Ottomans Demand Full Withdrawal"
crm.39.d:0 "The Ottomans still demand our full withdrawal from the island. Nevertheless, they won't risk the war with us so we can just ignore their ultimatumes."
crm.39.a:0 "Just ignore them."

crm.40.t:0 "Ukraine Ignores Us"
crm.40.d:0 "It seems that the Ukrainian government has ignored our ultimatum and they still occupy some part of the peninsula. While we cannot allow us to fight overseas now, it seems that we should just consider this as a matter of fact."
crm.40.a:0 "We have nothing to do with this."

crm.41.t:0 "Ottomans Demand We Calm Down Ukraine"
crm.41.d:0 "The Crimean crisis is still ongoing with the Crimean government asking for Ottoman support and now the Ukrainian forces refuse to withdraw from some parts of Crimea occupied by them.\n\nThe Ottomans demand their full withdrawal from the Crimea and asked for our mediation in reaching up to Ukraine."
crm.41.a:0 "We won't interfere."
crm.41.b:0 "In this case we should have access to Sevastopol."
crm.41.c:0 "Demand Ukrainian submission!"

crm.42.t:0 "Germany Refused to Interfere"
crm.42.d:0 "Germany refused to intervene in the conflict and support any side. Without their mediation, it seems that we should repeat our demands to the Ukrainian government."
crm.42.a:0 "The crisis shall end soon."

crm.43.t:0 "Germany Demands Access to Sevastopol"
crm.43.d:0 "Germany agreed to help, but demanded that they should have access to the Sevastopol bay, so it secures its Black Sea port."
crm.43.a:0 "We agree."
crm.43.b:0 "Do they understand what full withdrawal means?"

crm.44.t:0 "Ottomans Agree"
crm.44.d:0 "The Ottomans have agreed to allow us have access to the Sevastopol port. With this term finally negotiated, we can now start demanding Ukrainian government to withdraw."
crm.44.a:0 "The Ukrainians must submit."

crm.45.t:0 "Ottoman Refuse"
crm.45.d:0 "The Ottomans have refused our access to the Sevastopol port, reminding that no Reichspakt country should have any land in the Crimea."
crm.45.a:0 "We won't interfere then."
crm.45.b:0 "Let them have it already!"

crm.46.t:0 "Germany Demands To Withdraw!"
crm.46.d:0 "The Ottomans have asked the Germans to interfere in the conflict, and now our masters in Berlin demand that we should fully withdraw. We should either listen to our allies, or threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt."
crm.46.a:0 "As you say, Willy."

crm.47.t:0 "Ukraine Threatens to Leave the Reichspakt!"
crm.47.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has threatened us with leaving the Reichspakt if we do not recognize their supremacy over the entire peninsula.\n\nWe can meet them halfway and deny Crimea self-determination in order not to lose a military ally and our breadbasket, but our troops are always ready to strike and restore order in Kiev."
crm.47.a:0 "No one sets terms for Kaiserreich!"
crm.47.b:0 "We cannot lose Ukraine."

crm.48.t:0 "Germany Сoncedes"
crm.48.d:0 "The Kaiserreich showed its weakness and made concessions to Ukraine, which means we are worth something in their eyes. Due to the inability to continue an effective military campaign against Crimea, we are forced to offer them a temporary peace, but as soon as we recover, we will come for them."
crm.48.a:0 "Victory!"

crm.49.t:0 "Germany Threatens Us With Force"
crm.49.d:0 "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. Of course that means that we are on the verge of war with Reichspakt, but it worths it."
crm.49.a:0 "Khai Zhive, Zhive, Vilna Ukraina!"

crm.50.t:0 "Ukraine Withdraws From Crimea"
crm.50.d:0 "The Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Crimea, which means our victory, thanks to the Ottoman mediation. The war for independence has ended as quickly as it started."
crm.50.a:0 "Great!"

crm.51.t:0 "Ukraine Withdraws From Crimea"
crm.51.d:0 "The Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Crimea, which means our victory, thanks to the Ottoman and German mediation. However, we had to make some concessions to the Germans, giving them access to the Sevastopol port. The war for independence has ended as quickly as it started."
crm.51.a:0 "Great!"

crm.52.t:0 "Ukraine Refused to Withdraw!"
crm.52.d:0 "The Ukrainian government refused to withdraw, claiming the peninsula for themselves. We can try to put pressure on Ukraine, or we can turn directly to Berlin and demand that its allies calm down."
crm.52.a:0 "Demand full withdrawal of their forces."
crm.52.b:0 "Call Berlin."

crm.53.t:0 "Ottomans Demands Once Again"
crm.53.d:0 "The Ottomans have once again demanded our withdrawal and seemingly they don't understand that we refuse to do it. Everything will stay as it is."
crm.53.a:0 "Just ignore them."

crm.54.t:0 "Ottomans Refused to Support Us!"
crm.54.d:0 "The Ottomans have traitorously abandondes us in our attempt to reclaim independence for our people. It seems that now we were left alone with Ukraine, and nothing can stop the war."
crm.54.a:0 "Ottoman Betrayal!"

crm.55.t:0 "Ottomans Can't Help Us!"
crm.55.d:0 "Despite the initial support for our government, the Ottomans cannot risk the war with Reichspakt and, therefore, they had to leave the negotiations. It seems that now we were left alone with Ukraine, and nothing can stop the war."
crm.55.a:0 "Ottoman Betrayal!"

crm.56.t:0 "The Crisis Ends in Status-Quo"
crm.56.d:0 "The Ottomans cannot risk the war with the Reichspakt and Berlin did not give in their requests, so now we have to deal with Ukrainian presence on the peninsula. However, it is unlikely they would risk the war with us, at least for now."
crm.56.a:0 "Peace, at least."

crm.57.t:0 "Ukraine Ignores Us"
crm.57.d:0 "It seems that the Ukrainian government has ignored our ultimatum and they still occupy some part of the peninsula. While we cannot allow us to fight overseas now, it seems that we should just consider this as a matter of fact."
crm.57.a:0 "We have nothing to do with this."

crm.58.t:0 "The Crisis Ends in Status-Quo"
crm.58.d:0 "Unfortunately, we could not find an effective solution for signing peace, and it seems that the Crimean conflict has ended with the status quo, with each side retaining its claims and temporarily occupied territories."
crm.58.a:0 "We will get to them later."

crm.60.t:0 "Rebirth of the Crimean Khanate"
crm.60.d:0 "Sultan Kadyr of the House of Giray will become the first Crimean khan since 1863. The once great Khanate, whose rulers for a long time held control over the entire Ukrainian Black Sea coast and the mouth of the Dnieper, effectively "protecting" access to the sea from the Slavs, whose rulers organized successful campaigns against Moscow, was again restored under the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire."
crm.60.a:0 "The ancient dynasty is at the head again!"

crm.61.t:0 "Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
crm.61.d:0 "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Petrograd to ask for our support of their independence against [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea to Russia back in tsarist times, many Russian-speaking people live on the peninsula, making up a relative majority in many areas, so the safety of Crimeans should be a priority for us. On the other hand, support for Crimea now is undoubtedly a violation of the Minsk Agreement, which we are currently unable to cancel. We can try to come to an agreement with Ukraine to resolve the issue peacefully, but it is unknown whether we will be able to really influence the Ukrainian leadership. It is also important to note that the Crimean Tatar government is ruling in Crimea now, and, of course, it will act in the interests of its people, and we must make sure that the rights of Russians are not infringed."
crm.61.a:0 "Demand wide autonomy for Russians."
crm.61.b:0 "Support their government and demand Ukraine to withdraw."
crm.61.c:0 "We have no interest in Crimea."

crm.62.t:0 "Russia Demands Wide Autonomy for Russians"
crm.62.d:0 "The Russian government has agreed to support us if we give wide autonomy to the Russians. While we are mostly Crimean Tatar-oriented, we understand the importance of the Russian autonomy and can agree. However, the demand of wide autonomy is probably too much..."
crm.62.a:0 "Alright!"
crm.62.b:0 "The Russians overstep the mark!"

crm.63.t:0 "Crimean Government Agrees!"
crm.63.d:0 "The Crimean Government has agreed to give wide autonomy for Russians, so now we can sit down and focus on negotiations with Ukraine."
crm.63.a:0 "Demand Ukrainian withdrawal!"

crm.64.t:0 "Crimean Government Refused!"
crm.64.d:0 "The Crimean government has refused to give wide autonomy for Russians, claiming that we overstep the mark and that the Russians are not humiliated in rights. This is a clear lie, because we now for sure that the Crimean government consists of no Russians."
crm.64.a:0 "An end to our partnership."
crm.64.b:0 "We still can find profit in supporting them now."

crm.65.t:0 "Russia Tries to Intervene in Crimean Crisis!"
crm.65.d:0 "Due to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nWe have received information that Russia intends to invade the conflict and demand Ukraine to leave the Crimean peninsula, but we can regard this as a violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which means that their actions are illegal and run counter to the Minsk Agreement.\n\nWe can immediately demand that Russia stop all negotiations with Ukraine and deal directly with us, or forget about the Crimean issue altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, we can close our eyes to this misunderstanding. Of course, we don't need a strong Russia, but a weak Ukraine..."
crm.65.a:0 "Demand Russia respect Minsk Treaty!"
crm.65.b:0 "Russia should talk directly to us."

crm.66.t:0 "Germany Demands to Respect the Minsk Treaty!"
crm.66.d:0 "The German government has approached us on behalf of Ukrainian allies and told that our interest in Crimea violates the Minsk Treaty. Therefore, they demand that we immediately cease all contacts with Ukraine about the Crimean situation and forget about this region."
crm.66.a:0 "They will pay for it, but not now, unfortunately"

crm.67.t:0 "Germany Becomes Ukraine's Representative In Negotiations"
crm.67.d:0 "The German government has approached us on behalf of Ukrainian allies and told that we should settle all disputes directly with them. By doing this, Germany definetely wants to show that it is the master of our Ukrainian brothers and the outcome of the negotiations with a high probability it will be on their side."
crm.67.a:0 "Eh, sure, let's talk to them."

crm.68.t:0 "Germany and Russia Demands We Recognize Crimea!"
crm.68.d:0 "Our partners from Moscow and Berlin have approached us with a demand to recognize the Crimean government and its authority over all of Peninsula.\nDespite the fact that this is in principle a gross violation of our rights to the peninsula, it casts doubt on our further cooperation with Germany. However, we can try to negotiate the preservation of Sevastopol for us, and thus have a base on the peninsula and annex Crimea at the right moment. This will also allow the Black Sea Fleet to return to its home harbor."
crm.68.a:0 "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.68.b:0 "Demand Sevastopol base and Black Sea Fleet back."
crm.68.e:0 "Demand Sevastopol base"
crm.68.f:0 "Demand Perekop Isthmus under our control."
crm.68.c:0 "We submit to the Kaiser's will."

crm.69.t:0 "Ukraine Demands Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet"
crm.69.d:0 "The Ukrainian government suggested that they should keep Sevastopol as their base and also demanded the Crimean government to return the parts of the Black Sea Fleet that defected. While we can clearly see what they want from it, we can concede and perhaps even force Crimean Republic to comply with these terms. That would, however, deprive us from the direct access to the Crimea and the Black Sea, but we will save our more economically developed ally."
crm.69.a:0 "Offer these terms to the Russian government."
crm.69.b:0 "OUR terms must be accepted."

crm.70.t:0 "Germany Refused!"
crm.70.d:0 "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. We cannot threaten them, what if they have some sort of secret treaty with Russian and they will outright invade if we leave Reichspakt or just accept their terms."
crm.70.b:0 "Fine. We cannot risk our relations with Germans now."

The Extraordinary regional government of Krym wants to finally form a functioning, workable government for the next few years, but for this it is necessary to solve one main question - whether the already rather elderly Solomon should remain head of state, or resign, remembered by all Crimeans as a hero-liberator of Crimea from foreign influence, and appoint a younger, capable and energetic Crimean Tatar figure to the post of Prime-Minister of the Republic.\n\nThere are two candidates for the position of Solomon's successor. The first is Seidamet Jafer, an ideologue and one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar people in the initial period of the Civil War, Minister of War and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first government of the national hero of Crimea N. Celebijikhan and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Crimean regional government Sulkevich, until the resignation of the latter.\nThe second is Amet Ozenbashly, a candidate with a socialist bias in his views. He participated in the negotiations between the government of Sulkevich and the Hetman in 1918, and then did not emigrate and in 1920 became one of the founders of the agricultural organization "Shirket", which had branches in all regions of the Crimea and united members of the National Party. In addition, he became a member of the organization "Koch Yardim" ("Assistance to migrants"), which aimed to create favorable conditions for the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and the Bulgarian kingdom. Despite the fact that he stayed in Crimea after the occupation by Ukraine, it was only due to his patriotism and love for Crimea."

There are also two stripes: red in the upper part of the banner and yellow in the lower one.\n\nWe can adopt another flag, which will have only red stripes or another one, which will have only yellow stripes."

Everyone knows that the bourgeois press is one of the powerful weapons of the bourgeoisie. Especially at critical moments, when the new power, the power of the workers and peasants, is only being consolidated, it was impossible to completely leave these weapons in the hands of the enemy at a time when they are no less dangerous at such moments than bombs and machine guns. That is why temporary and emergency measures were taken to curb the flow of dirt and slander, in which the yellow and green press would willingly drown the young victory of the people.\nAs soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative influences on the press will be stopped, complete freedom will be established for it within the limits of responsibility before the court, according to the broadest and most progressive law in this regard. Taking into account, however, that the constraint of the press, even at critical moments, is permissible only within the limits absolutely necessary. The Council of People 's Commissars decides:\n\n1. Only press bodies are subject to closure:\n1) calling for open resistance or disobedience to the Workers' and Peasants' government;\n2) sowing confusion by clearly slanderous distortion of facts;\n3) calling for acts of a clearly criminal, i.e. criminally punishable nature.\n2.

crm.158.d:0 "Comrade Toilers! Remember that you yourself are now running the government. Unless you get together and take all affairs of the government into your own hands, no one will do it for you. Your Soviets are from now on all-powerful and all-decisive organs of government. Rally around your Soviets. Strengthen them. Take matters into your hands and don't wait for anyone to tell you what to do. Insist on the strictest revolutionary order.\nOrganize strict control over production and accountability for the products. Bring before the revolutionary tribunal everyone who dares to harm the cause of the people by sabotaging (spoiling, hindering, destroying) in industry, concealing grain and produce, interfering with transportation of grain, tearing up rail, post, and telegraph lines, or in other ways opposing the great cause of peace, of transferring the land to the peasants, and of assuming workers' control over production and distribution.\nComrade workers, soldiers, peasants, and all toilers! Take all local power into your own hands. Take and guard as the apple of your eye the grain, factories, implements, products, and transport--all these are from now on wholly yours; they are public property.\nGradually, with the approval and agreement of the majority of the peasants, guided by their practical experience and that of the workers, we shall move on firmly and resolutely to the victory of socialism, a victory which the advance guard of the workers of the more civilized countries will make secure and which is bound to give the people a lasting peace and freedom from all oppression and exploitation.\n\nD.

crm.159.b:0 "No!"

crm.160.t:0 "The Khazars"
crm.160.d:0 "For a long time, the Karaites were considered completely ordinary Jews who professed another branch of Judaism and who rejected Talmudic principles. However, since when the Crimea was annexed into Russia, the new theory has been developing not only in the hearts and souls of our people, but in the scientific circles as well. Today, with Seraya Shapshal's theory becoming more and more popular, we understand clearly our ancestry.\n\nWe are the descendants of the Khazars - a once-mighty group of Turkic Tatars that ruled a khanate that once spanned from Ukraine to Central Asia. Though our faith may be different and our traditions slightly altered, we are their descendants, and their glories as our glories. However, that also means the burden is now on us to untarnish their legacy and lead our shared Turkic race to glory.  We have much to do to revive the Khazaric traditions and finally get rid of any rabbinic influence that has been spreading into Crimea."
crm.160.a:0 "The truth has triumphed"

crm.161.t:0 "Shapshal's Doctrine of Dejudaization of Karaism"
crm.161.d:0 "Although we, the Karaites, and our religion are Jewish by faith, we are in no way ethnic Jews. We are not Ashkenazim or Sephardim, we are Turks, descendants of the Khazars!\n\nAccording to the doctrine of de-judicization of karaites by Seraya Shapshal, all the influence of Jewish ethnicity and non-Turkic culture should be eliminated from our religion and our identity so that we can be our own, unique and unsurpassed peoples. And despite the fact that this process may take a long time, we must begin the main transformations now - and the next generation of Karaites will never remember their false Jewish origin.\n\nAmong the main postulates of this doctrine, Shapshal singled out the following:\nKaraites are the indigenous ethnic group of the Crimea, which existed long before they adopted the teachings of Anan ben David.\nThe teachings of Anan ben David were close to early Christianity, and Jesus and Muhammad Karaites were considered prophets from time immemorial. The Karaites of Crimea adopted the law of Moses, but continued to adhere to ancient Turkic pagan beliefs."
crm.161.a:0 "Finally we have understood this."

crm.162.t:0 "Replacing the Names of Holidays and Months"
crm.162.d:0 "Within the framework of the doctrine of de-Judaization, it is necessary to Turkify the Karaite population, therefore Shapshal proposed to start by renaming traditional holidays from Hebrew roots to Turkic ones.\n\nFrom this day, the new names were adopted. 'Pesach' changes to Tymbyl Chydžy, 'the Post of the 9th Tammuz' - to Burunhu Oruč, 'Shavuot' - to Aftalar Chydzy, and others. Moreover, the new celebration was introduced in order to symbolize the beginning of the year - Jyl Bašy."
crm.162.a:0 "That will definetely spread Turkification policies!"

crm.163.t:0 "Our Bygone Religion"
crm.163.d:0 "One of the unique features of the doctrine of our great leader-reformer is the return of the great traditions of the pagan past of the Karaites-Khazars.\n\nThe relics of the archaic Karaite cults date back to paganism, shamanism, and Tengrianism. Although, according to Shapshal, "the Karaite clergy managed to transform the worldview of their co-religionists for a number of centuries," it is the ancient cults that are the original cultural heritage of the Crimean Karaites, requiring study, preservation and restoration. Among the native Karaite rituals to be restored: the cult of sacred oaks, ostrich eggs as a talisman and others.\n\nIn the near future, it is planned to restore the veneration of Sacred oaks, restore some pagan holidays and give them the features of traditional Karaite culture."
crm.163.a:0 "Interesting"

crm.164.t:0 "Militarization of Karaite History"
crm.164.d:0 "Militarization should occupy a significant place in Karaite history. Seraya Shapshal described in detail and stated the facts that the ancient Karaites were great warriors who served in the Polish-Lithuanian and Hetman army. Traces of the military history of the Karaites are reflected in the national symbols, including senek ('two-horned spear') and kalkan (shield).\n\nThe militarization of Karaite history also includes giving the theory of the great Karaite commander, Prince Elyaga Uzun official status, as well as the Karaite origin of the Pereyaslav colonel of the Zaporozhye Host, Ilyash Karaimovich.\n\nWith the publication of these facts, Seraya Shapshal hopes for the development of a sense of patriotism and nationality among our people and their readiness for a war for the revival of the great Khazaria."
crm.164.a:0 "We have always been warriors!"

crm.165.t:0 "Abolition of Hebrew Teaching in Schools"
crm.165.d:0 "Within the framework of the doctrine of de-Judaization of the Karaites, Seraya Shapshal abolished the teaching of Hebrew in schools, replacing it with the study of his native language - Crimean-Karaite. In addition, the Torah and other important documents were translated into the Karaite language, and the Karaite language became the official language in Crimea for political and public events, not counting events organized by other autonomies."
crm.165.a:0 "Speak Qirimkaraylar language!"

crm.166.t:0 "The Gakhan of the Khazaria"
crm.166.d:0 "The completion of the doctrine of de-Judaization of the Karaites was the official proclamation of the Seray Shapshal as the Gakhan of the Crimean Karaites and the new ruler of the Khazar Khaganate (Gakhanate).\n\nReplacing the word 'gakham' with the Turkic 'Gakhan', Shapshal seeks to emphasize the Turkic origin of the Karaites, because 'gakhan' etymologically comes from the Khazar 'kagan'. Despite the fact that Shapshal has long called himself Gakhan, today it was officially confirmed.\n\nIn addition, the Crimean state officially became known as the Khazar Khaganate, which allowed our leader to declare the revival of the great empire of the past."
crm.166.a:0 "The Khazaria has been revived!"

crm.167.t:0 "Legacy of Solomon Krym"
crm.167.d:0 "The national father of our independent Crimea, as well as a fellow Karaite, Solomon Krym, is perhaps the greatest modern figure of Crimea. He also sadly passed away, but this does not mean that his legacy should end there. Although he was not enthusiastic about our nationalist movement, the public does not need to know this. We will perceive Krym as the first Karaite hero of our time and a martyr, the herald of our new destiny. He will become a national hero of Crimea, and his image and legacy will become ideal tools that the state can use to win over the masses, because he was a man who united our people against foreign enemies and serious threats like no other."
crm.167.a:0 "The legacy of Solomon shall never perish!"

crm.168.t:0 "Denounce Rabbinic Judaism"
crm.168.d:0 "Although the Karaites technically descend from a rabbinic sect, we are in no way connected with their heretical ideas, despite our proximity to the Crimean Jews of Crimea. Although we would never harm our fellow Jews, we hereby officially condemn rabbinic Judaism and renounce any and all rabbinic ties, for our refined, purified and uniquely Turkic Karaite Judaism is the only true Jewish faith.\n\nOur proclamation has already become the object of fierce public discussion in Europe, especially among the Ashkenazi population, and many social movements demanded explanations from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which once again had to explain that there is nothing anti-Semitic or reprehensible in their actions, but only a statement of the fact of the Karaite past."
crm.168.a:0 "We determine our own destiny"

crm.169.t:0 "The Issue of Krymchaks"
crm.169.d:0 "Our fellow Crimeans profess Rabbinic Judaism, and in this regard, the question of their religious and national affiliation has become acute. Despite their small number (less than 1,000 people), the government proposes to create special conditions for the Crimeans so that they can preserve their national, ethnic and religious affiliation in the conditions of the new Kaganate. We can grant them autonomy and the opportunity to live according to their traditional customs, or simply leave everything as it is, which may lead to the speedy extinction of their people or assimilation."
crm.169.a:0 "We shall grant them autonomy."
crm.169.b:0 "Everything shall stay as it is."

crm.170.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Funds Karaite Minority"
crm.170.d:0 "Since ancient times, a large Tatar diaspora has lived in Lithuania, professing Karaism and coming from the lands of the Crimea. Now that the Karaites have become dominant on their territory and announced the creation of a new Khazar Khaganate, we learned that they actively sponsor the Karaite Lithuanian communities. Despite the fact that these actions are aimed at supporting the Karaite people, and are not aimed at any military and separatist sentiments, we can cut off these ties for our security."
crm.170.a:0 "Stop their funding!"
crm.170.b:0 "Perhaps, this will do no harm to us"

crm.171.t:0 "True Ashkenazi Origins"
crm.171.d:0 "Today we have become the object of state propaganda of the Khazar Khaganate, which began to distribute mainly among the numerous Ashkenazi population an article about the true origin of the Ashkenazim.\n\nTheir theory postulated that Ashkenazi Jews were primarily, or to a large extent, descended from Khazars, a multi-ethnic conglomerate of mostly Turkish people who formed a semi-nomadic khanate in and around the northern and central Caucasus and the Pontic–Caspian steppe.\n\nOf course, we understand that their propaganda is undoubtedly aimed at attracting our Jewish population to new lands in the Crimea, and we need to attract experts as soon as possible and publish official statements about the failure of their theory."
crm.171.a:0 "Madness!"

crm.172.t:0 "True Cossack Origins"
crm.172.d:0 "The Khazar Khaganate began to spread propaganda among our population about the true origin of the Cossacks. According to their theory, the origin of the Cossacks is exclusively Khazar, and that the Khazars were also a Slavic people. Despite the inconsistency of this theory, it began to gain popularity among our population and even gave rise to slogans about unification with the Khazar Khaganate.\n\nWe must officially renounce this theory or leave everything as it is, hoping for the consciousness of our people."

Not since Russia consumed the peninsula in 1783, breaking the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca after decades of tense relations and conflicts with the Ottomans, has Crimea been free, and now with the myriad peoples of the peninsula all breathing free air, the future of Crimea has never been more wide-open. As the newly independent state now settles its new foundations, the world looks to this small but vital hold on the Black Sea with curious eyes, for the people of Crimea claim to have big plans - even while the Ukrainians, Russians, and other opportunistic forces already begin to circle Crimea like hungry wolves."

Finally snuffed from existence in 1783 after the Russians marched into the peninsula and took Crimea for themselves, the Khanate stood for over 300 years before that with the aid of their Ottoman allies. As if history was destined to repeat itself, the Ottomans once again moved to tie themselves to the newly independent Crimea, and now, as if it were 1441, the Great Horde and Desht-i Kipchak rises again from the ashes of their old civilization. With the Khanate restored, the Crimeans have reaffirmed their centuries-old alliance with the Sultan of Islambol, and now together they seek to lead the Crimean Tatars to greatness."

Instead, it would seem that the newly independent state of Crimea has become the new heart of Bolshevik fervor, and a new vanguard of the Proletariat has risen to fill the shoes of the late Vladimir Lennin - and who better to take his place than his own brother! Standing as the new Premier of the Crimean Soviet Republic, Dmitri Ilyich Ulyanov - the younger brother to Vladamir Ilyich Ulyanov ‘Lenin’ - has announced his plans to restart the Russian Revolution, finishing what his beloved brother could not. Issuing the Great Decrees once more and rallying the disparate Crimeans to his side, many call Dmitri a madman grasping at old glories, but perhaps this aging revolutionary is the second-coming the Bolsheviks truly need. Nothing is for certain, though the world’s eyes are now glued to this tiny peninsula to see what transpires next."

crm.184.d:0 "Rising from the ashes like a phoenix reborn, the Khazar Khaganate stands anew on the Crimean Peninsula, ready to spread the one, true faith of Karaite Judaism to the old lands of Khazaria. Casting off their Rabbinic heritage and the Zionist notions of their distant relatives the Asheknazi, the Karaites have embraced their ‘true’ heritage has children of the Khazars, and now seek to restore the old khaganate to its former glories while united under the Karaite faith. Though many have called them zealots and heretics driven on by dubious historical accounts and false delusions of grandeur, the Karaites stand proud and poised to retake the lands of their supposed ancestors. For now, however, the world shall watch and wait to see what these strange Jews do next."

Though our faith may be different and our traditions slightly altered, we are their descendants, and their glories as our glories. However, that also means the burden is now on us to untarnish their legacy and lead our shared Turkic race to glory."

CRM_Dejudaization_Of_Karaites:0 "Dejudaization of Karaites"
CRM_Dejudaization_Of_Karaites_desc:0 "Though we Karaites and our religion are Jewish in faith, we are in no way ethnically Jews. We are neither Ashekenazi or Sephardic; we are Tatar! All influence of Jewish ethnicity and non-Turkic culture must be stripped from our religion and our identity so that we may be our own, unique, and unmatched peoples. We are no sons of David, for we are the sons of the great Khans of old!"

CRM_Militarization_Of_Karaite_History:0 "Militarization of Karaite History"
CRM_Militarization_Of_Karaite_History_desc:0 "We must paint our history and tradition in a martial legacy if we are to rally our normally peaceful people to war. We must teach each and every son of Crimea that they are the heirs to the old khantes and hordes of our Turkic ancestors, and that all they must do to seize this glory is to embody their martial legacy. Our history shall be painted in the red of blood and war, and we shall become the new champions of this new history."

CRM_Research_Pagan_Roots:0 "Research Our Pagan Roots"
CRM_Research_Pagan_Roots_desc:0 "According to the works and words of our glorious leader Seraya Shapshal, our Karaite faith has deep pagan roots. In his eyes, we are descended from pagans who adopted the law of Moses and Jesus and Mohammed as prophets while continuing to adhere to ancient Turkic beliefs. From the worship of old sacred oaks to the belief in a polytheisitic pantheon under Tengri, and even to our ancestors’ use of sacrifice, these revelations brought to us by Shapshal must be brought back to practice. We shall embrace these Pagan truths, bringing us closer to the faith of the old ones."

CRM_Turkification:0 "Turkification"
CRM_Turkification_desc:0 "In order to further our ‘dejudaization,’ we must instead start a program of ‘Turkification.’ We shall elevate, advertise, and promote everything that makes our people true-blooded Turkics, for that is what chiefly defines us and our race - not our religion. God’s chosen race is the Turkics, and we will abide by His wishes."

CRM_Abolish_Teaching_Hebrew:0 "Abolish Teaching Hebrew"
CRM_Abolish_Teaching_Hebrew_desc:0 "The Hebrew language and the texts written in it must be fully abolished from our faith. As non-Rabbinics, we deny any of the written-down oral traditions such as the Talmud or the Midrash as religious truth, but now we shall take it further. Any texts written in Hebrew are to be destroyed and Hebrew itself as a language and writing system shall be banned in all forms. No longer shall this Rabbinic trace taint our pure Karaite religion."

CRM_Accept_The_Title_Of_Gakhan:0 "Accept the Title of Gakhan"
CRM_Accept_The_Title_Of_Gakhan_desc:0 "The word ‘Gakhan’ is the Turkic alternative to ‘Gahkam’ which in itself is derived from the Khazar word ‘Kagan,’ at least according to Shapshal. The title holds immense weight, carrying on the glory and tradition of the old Khazar Khanate of old. Our leader has risen to take this title as his own, rising to become Gakhan Shapshal of the new Khazar Khaganate. Under his illustrious and stalwart leadership, the Karaites shall reach their destiny as the heirs to Khazaria."

CRM_Militarization_Of_Karaite_Reality:0 "Militarization of Karaite Reality"
CRM_Militarization_Of_Karaite_Reality_desc:0 "With our history repainted in a martial hue, it is now time to reflect that history in our current reality. We must modernize and militarize the nation and the industry behind it so that we can be prepared for any foe as we rise to reclaim the legacy of our ancestors. With new factories, new conscripts, and new weapons of war, we shall seize our destiny by force."

CRM_Make_An_Example_Of_Solomon_Krym:0 "Honor the ‘Real’ Solomon Krym"
CRM_Make_An_Example_Of_Solomon_Krym_desc:0 "The national father of our independent Crimea and a fellow Karaite as well, Solomon Krym is perhaps Crimea’s greatest contemporary figure. He is also sadly deceased, but that does not mean his legacy must end there. Though he was not fond of our nationalist movement, the public does not need to know that. We shall raise Krym as the first Karaite hero of the modern age and the martyred herald of our new destiny. He will become Crimea’s own national hero and his image and legacy will be perfect tools to utilize by the state to win over the masses, for he was the man who united our people against foreign foes and grave threats like none other."

CRM_Reject_Semitic_Origins:0 "Reject Semitic Origins"
CRM_Reject_Semitic_Origins_desc:0 "We are no sons of David or Abarham, for we are the sons of the Turkic Khans! Though we are devout in our Jewish faith, we have no links of blood or culture to the Semite and their widespread diaspora. Unlike these failed children of God, we shall reclaim our homeland and march to our destiny free of their disgraces as the true heirs to the Turkic Khazars."

CRM_Request_Entente_Economic_Support:0 "Request Entente Economic Support"
CRM_Request_Entente_Economic_Support_desc:0 "The Entente are our national allies in the coming struggle. We should reach out to their bloc and begin economic talks so that we can march into a prosperous and profitable future."

CRM_Join_The_IEDC:0 "Join the ISAC"
CRM_Join_The_IEDC_desc:0 "In order to deepen our ties with the Entente even further, we shall join their international science commission. Together, we shall coordinate and cooperate in order to foster closer relations and scientific advances for the good of the entire alliance."

CRM_Treaty_With_Egypt:0 "A Treaty with Egypt"
CRM_Treaty_With_Egypt_desc:0 "With our preparations for war slowly crescendoing to a showdown with the old Sublime Porte, it would be wise to establish diplomatic ties with Egypt. Through a new secret treaty, we shall affirm the cooperation between our two nations as we both prepare to bring down the hedonistic land of the Ottomans."

CRM_Organize_Weapons_Shipments:0 "Organize Weapons Shipments"
CRM_Organize_Weapons_Shipments_desc:0 "To fight the coming war, we will need every firearm and weapon of war we can muster. We must reach out to the international market, whether it be the White market or the Black, in order to requisition the gun shipments we will need to arm our military in full."

CRM_Denounce_Rabbinists:0 "Denounce Rabbinic Judaism"
CRM_Denounce_Rabbinists_desc:0 "Though the Karaites are technically derived from the Rabbinic sect, we are in no way linked to their heretical ideas despite our close proximity to the Krymchak Jews of Crimea. Though we would never bring harm to our fellow Jewish brethren, we hereby formally denounce Rabbinic Judaism and renounce any and all Rabbinic ties, for our refined, purified, and uniquely Turkic Karaite Judaism is the one, true Jewish faith."

CRM_Establish_Ties_With_Lithuanian_Karaites:0 "Establish Ties with Lithuanian Karaites"
CRM_Establish_Ties_With_Lithuanian_Karaites_desc:0 "Lithuania holds a small but vibrant population of fellow Karaites who emigrated there decades ago after a series of repressions done by the old Russian Empire. We should reach out to these distant kin and establish close ties with their community and businesses, fostering unity between all Karaites. Though they may be far from Crimea, they can still help our rising state prosper."

CRM_Spread_The_Khazar_Myth:0 "Spread the Truth of the Khazar Myth"
CRM_Spread_The_Khazar_Myth_desc:0 "The Khazar hypotheses for Ashkenazi and Cossack ancestry, called the Khazar Myth by its foolish detractors, states that both the Cossacks and the Askenazi Jews are descended from the Khazars, and as such, most European Jews and Cossacks are of our blood. Seraya Shapshal is a close adherent to this theory, and one of its loudest proponents. By his word, the so-called ‘Khazar Myth’ shall be revealed to be what it truly always has been - nothing but the truth!"

CRM_Revive_Khazar_Traditions:0 "Revive the Culture and Traditions of Khazaria"
CRM_Revive_Khazar_Traditions_desc:0 "The traditions and culture of Khazari must be revitalized to become the bedrock of our new khaganate. Though they have faded into the pages of history, we shall not let the noble great horde be forgotten, for it is our duty as their heirs to ensure that their memory and customs live on in perpetuity. Their culture shall become our culture, modified and modernized to fit the needs of our state."

CRM_Restoring_Our_Legacy:0 "Restoring Our Legacy"
CRM_Restoring_Our_Legacy_desc:0 "The time to cast off our shackles shall soon be upon us, for the time to restore the legacy of the Khazar Khanate is near. We will soon march into our bright new future under Gakhan Shapshal and bring honor and prosperity to the Karaites like never before. Let us charge into our destiny and restore our khaganate from the sands of time!"

CRM_Preemptive_Srike_On_Ukrainians:0 "Preemptive Strike on the Ukrainians"
CRM_Preemptive_Srike_On_Ukrainians_desc:0 "The Ukranians have been plotting their revenge since the moment we declared an independent Crimea. We must strike them before they strike us, for only through the element of surprise will we succeed. To war, and to Kiev!"

CRM_Bring_Cossacks_Into_The_Fold:0 "Bring Cossacks Into the Fold"
CRM_Bring_Cossacks_Into_The_Fold_desc:0 "The Don and Kuban Cossacks lie open and unsuspecting to our greater ambitions. There they sit, across the thinnest point of the Black Sea just East of the Kerch Strait, just ready for the taking. We shall march to Yekaterinodar and beyond, seizing the lands of the Northern Caucasus and beyond before we strike Russia."

CRM_Restore_Volga_Bulgaria:0 "Restore Volga Bulgaria"
CRM_Restore_Volga_Bulgaria_desc:0 "To the North, Russia lords over the Volga Bulgars - our linguistic and ethnic brethren. We will march into the icy lands of the Northern Bear and liberate these fellow Turkics, recreating the once-noble Volga Bulgaria as a buffer state between our borders and the wilds of Russian Asia and wider Europe."

CRM_Third_Arab_Khazar_War:0 "Third Arab-Khazar War"
CRM_Third_Arab_Khazar_War_desc:0 "Despite its confusing name, the third Arab-Khazar war is firstly named as such because of the previous two wars, fought more than a thousand years ago between Khazars and Khalifates of the Middle East, that precede it and secondly in order to stoke up more patriotic fervor with the masses by pulling on age-old grudges. Though it is not exactly the same foe, we are once again fighting against another powerful Muslim country - the Ottoman Empire! Now let us march to Istanbul and burn it to the ground!"

CRM_Pax_Khazarica:0 "PAX CHAZARICA"
CRM_Pax_Khazarica_desc:0 "Under our noble and pious hand, the lands of the Khazar Khaganate have been united under our regime. We are the heirs of Khazaria and the greatest, most noble practitioners of the Jewish faith on Earth. By casting off the last shreds of Rabbinic influence and uplifting our Turkic legacy, we have brought honor and prosperity to the Karaite people at last. An unprecedented era of peace has begun under the rule of Gakhan Shapshal, and now under his guidance we shall march proudly into our new golden age."


### Ideas ###
CRM_water_shortage:0 "Water Shortage"
CRM_water_shortage_desc:0 "The shortage of fresh water has existed on the peninsula at all times. The main reasons are considered to be arid climate and karst rocks. The problem was partially solved when, in 1931, the Bakhchisarai reservoir was built on the Egiz-Oba beam, filled with Kacha waters. However, the growth of the urban population complicates this problem. If we fail to solve it as the peninsula industrializes, we may face serious consequences."
CRM_water_shortage_tt:0 "§RWe will face a serious humanitarian and environmental disaster if we don't deal with water shortage timely§!"

CRM_severe_water_shortage:0 "Severe Water Shortage"
CRM_severe_water_shortage_desc:0 "We have exceeded the reserves of fresh water sufficient for the viability of the peninsula, and now we are facing serious problems with water scarcity. If we do not find water sources for our population in the near future, we will face a serious humanitarian and environmental disaster"

CRM_local_revolt:0 "Local Uprisings"
CRM_local_revolt_desc:0 "The local indigenous population of the Crimean Tatars began a large-scale agitation against our regime. And although their leadership, the so-called Crimean Tatar Kurultai, does not call for active protest actions, the local population is still dissatisfied. Minor uprisings are breaking out all over the peninsula, preventing us from effectively pursuing policy."

CRM_ukrainian_ascendancy:0 "Ukrainian Ascendancy"
CRM_ukrainian_ascendancy_desc:0 "The Ukrainians have been ruling over Crimea for too long, it is time to fight for its independence."

CRM_ever_present_russians:0 "Ever-present Russians"
CRM_ever_present_russians_desc:0 "Almost 40% of the peninsula's population consider themselves Russians. Russian Russians, unlike the rest of Ukraine, the situation here is particularly acute, since the Russian population here is an absolute majority, both in comparison with Ukrainians and in comparison with Russians. The policy of Ukrainization carried out over the past 15 years has only worsened the situation, and we have to constantly make concessions to the Russians. However, surrounded on all sides by anti-Russian countries and the sea, perhaps no one will save them in time."

CRM_khazar_revival_society:0 "Krymkaraylar Influence"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_desc:0 "Seraya Shapshal, or, as he is called, His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal, is a spiritual leader of the Tatar Karaims, a Jewish religious movement. Since 1911 he has been the hakham of the Tauride and Odessa Karaite spiritual board and under his patronage the Jewish rights of Crimeans were respected. The Hetman's rule changed everything, when the policy of Ukrainisation, even if it was not as harsh as Shapshal imagined, made him openly speak against King, criticize Hetman and start public discussion about Jewish autonomy in the Crimea. He is not as simple as he seems, and in the future he can become a serious problem."

CRM_khazar_revival_society_1:0 "Khazar Revival Society"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_1_desc:0 "With our republic finally becoming independent from the Ukraine, the Karaite influence and Shapshal's authority has grown a lot. In fact, to the extent where he proclaimed the restoration of Khazar Khaganate under his rule. This is a pure nonsense, but such influential person as Shapshal can turn the Jewish population against us."

CRM_khazar_revival_society_2:0 "Dreams of Khazar Khaganate"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_2_desc:0 "The Khazar Revival Society under His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal have seized power in Crimea, efficiently removing all non-Jewish from official positions. The dream of restoring the Khazar Khaganate is still in the air, and the desire of our nation to fight for it has grown as well."

CRM_crimean_tatar_rule:0 "Krymtatarlar!"

On the way to a multinational federation, we have to make concessions, but this definitely guarantees peace and prosperity for our region."

CRM_crimea_for_crimeans:0 "Crimea For The Crimeans!"
CRM_crimea_for_crimeans_desc:0 "The Government of the Crimean People's Republic has embarked on the Ukrainization and de-Russification of the peninsula.
