###Bio###
POLITICS_VASYL_DESC:0 "King Vasyl I von Habsburg-Lothringen is regarded by most ethnic Slavs, Russians and Ukrainians alike, to be a humiliating symbol of foreign dominance. In fact, with political polarisation growing so rapidly in Ukraine, a disdain for King Vasyl is perhaps the only commonality amongst Ukrainians. With such opposition, a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_NIKITA_KRUSCHEV_DESC:0 "Nikita Kruschev, authoritarian socialist, has become the premier of Ukraine. Kruschev, born to Russian peasants near the current Russian-Ukrainian border, harbours a deep disdain for the landowning Kulaks; he plans to eliminate the Kulaks as a social class through forced seizure and collectivisation of their land. Such measures, however, are unpopular among all but a small number of Ukrainians, which may force Kruschev to compromise."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC:0 "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo's support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Rada and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
POLITICS_LEV_II_DESC:0 "Count Leo Stefan was born to the Habsburg-Lorraine family on June 12, 1928. Being groomed to potentially succeed to the throne of a Eastern European state, Leo ended up gaining a lot of knowledge and respect for Ukrainian customs. Eventually he would be raised to this position as Lev II once King Vasyl was killed by a communist, he now tries his best to represent Ukraine. This knowledge and actual attempt to help Ukraine was noticed by some socialists who wished to keep the stability of the crown yet bring forth leftist ideals. Being entangled within these ideals, Lev the II now reigns Ukraine as the People’s King, representing and supporting their struggles against those that would keep the peasantry, and wider Ukraine down."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC:0 "King Daniil Skoropadsky, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Daniil however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadsky's death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."

POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BULGAKOV_DESC:0 "Mikhail Bulgakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kiev governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
POLITICS_DMITRI_DONTSOV_DESC:0 "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. His organisation, the OUN has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."

### Ideas ###
language_issue:0 "Issue of the Russian language"
language_issue_desc:0 "The centuries-long Russian dominance of Ukraine and suppression of the Ukrainian language has produced a sizeable Russian-speaking minority, or perhaps even majority, in Ukraine. With independence, the Ukrainian language has been reinvigorated, much to the chagrin of numerous Russo-Ukrainians, many of whom resist the Ukrainian government or even desire a return to Russian rule."
Hetman_army:0 "Hetman's Army"
Hetman_army_desc:0 "The Hetman of Ukraine, general Pavlo Skoropadsky, supported by Germany, undermined Austrian influence in Ukraine following the 1927 Austrian Ausgleich renegotiations. The political strife between the military, dominated by the Hetman, and the Ukrainian Rada, headed by the king, has left Ukraine's military in such disarray that even personal reconciliation between the Hetman and Rada would seem to be insufficient; the Ukrainian military is in dire need of reform."

### Events ###
ukraine.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
ukraine.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadsky, set the tone for Ukraine's future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasily, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadsky, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasily becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbinantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Syndicalists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
ukraine.1.a:0 "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"
ukraine.2.t:0 "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d:0 "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavel Skoropadsky does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine's problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
ukraine.2.a:0 "We shouldn't provoke the peasants!"
ukraine.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukraine.3.a:0 "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."
ukraine.4.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d:0 "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a:0 "We're still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"
ukraine.5.t:0 "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d:0 "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev, Mikhail Bulgakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a:0 "We really must protest!"
ukraine.6.t:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky returns from Africa"
ukraine.6.d:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky, a young and talented officer, has returned to Ukraine. He was a member of the voluntary Ukrainian division, which supported our German allies in regional conflicts in the Mittelafrikan bush. His books 'On the Banks of the Congo' and 'Safari' previously made him the most popular Ukrainian soldier and writer in the entire country. Chernyakhovsky has been promoted to the rank of Colonel and will soon become the commander of the 1st Cossack Division ('Serdyutskaya'), which ensures this popular figure will command an elite branch of the Ukrainian army."
ukraine.6.a:0 "Welcome home Ivan!"
ukraine.7.t:0 "Dmitri Dontsov Deported From Galicia-Lodomeria"
ukraine.7.d:0 "Dmitri Dontsov, an renowned ideologue of Ukrainian nationalism, has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the local Ukrainian minority to resist the Austro-Hungarian administration. He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that's why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a:0 "Welcome home I suppose..."
ukraine.8.t:0 "Khrushchev criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."
ukraine.8.a:0 "Extreme measures? This stinks of Bolshevikism!"
ukraine.9.t:0 "Our Future"
ukraine.9.d:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation's most important institutions. The King's grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."
ukraine.9.a:0 "Ukraine will stagger on as it always has!"
ukraine.10.t:0 "Khrushchev's Speech"
ukraine.10.d:0 "As one of the few social democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Khrushchev's popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."
ukraine.10.a:0 "Dismiss Skoropadsky and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.11.t:0 "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation's history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Khrushchev respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
ukraine.11.a:0 "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.11.b:0 "Arrest important pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.12.t:0 "National-Syndicalists Protest!"
ukraine.12.d:0 "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumsky oppose Khrushchev's decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in administrative institutions. They claim that this measure won't help to unify our country and that unopposed usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in Southern and Eastern Ukrainian."
ukraine.12.a:0 "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.12.b:0 "All right, all right. Restore the status quo."
ukraine.13.t:0 "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.13.d:0 "Leaders of the different pro-Russian movements have unfortunately managed to escape Ukrainian soil before they could be arrested. Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser's gaze turning west. Mikhail Bulgakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.13.a:0 "Another problem!"
ukraine.14.t:0 "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
ukraine.14.d:0 "Our decision to raise taxes on the Kulak landlords and spend this money on the poorest peasants has helped to stabilise our agriculture sector. 60-70% of the state and private farms are estimated to now be entirely self-supporting. As a result of our increased support from the villages and farms we can turn to other pressing issues with our faltering economy."
ukraine.14.a:0 "That's one fire extinguished."
ukraine.15.t:0 "Another Crisis!"
ukraine.15.d:0 "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation attempts have ended in a total failure, with agricultural yields from the new collectivised farms cumulatively less than the smallholdings that they replaced. Unbelievably the situation in Ukraine has managed to deteriorate even further!"
ukraine.15.a:0 "Proof that Syndicalism doesn't always work."
ukraine.16.t:0 "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"

A nervous King Vasily was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt.

ukraine.80.d:0 "Nikita Krushchev has been tasked with resolving Ukraine’s economic stagnation, in a speech to parliament Krushchev announced a new economic programme aimed at increasing profits for the state. Originally Krushchev had wished to collectivise the lands owned by Ukraine’s peasant landowners, the Kulaks, however facing much opposition within parliament he has been forced to take a more moderate stance. Instead increased taxation will be enforced upon the Kulaks whose large workforce and high yields will continue to fulfill the populace’s needs whilst generating additional profits."
ukraine.80.a:0 "Surely these farmers won't mind a few less pennies in return for their land."
ukraine.82.t:0 "Military Command Seized by Khrushchev!"
ukraine.82.d:0 "The Ukrainian Armed Forces have been infested by reactionary nationalists since its formation, these politically connected generals serve to promote ideas that conflict with Comrade Khrushchev’s  grand revolutionary plans. Therefore it is unacceptable to maintain the current military command structure, these reactionaries will be demoted and replaced will those loyal to our great Comrade, for the sake of stability and avoiding any possible outright insurgencies it has been advised not to completely purge these generals. For now at least..."
ukraine.82.a:0 "Loyalty has its rewards..."
ukraine.83.t:0 "Populyarnyy front"
ukraine.83.d:0 "The Popular Front is a common name used to refer to an unofficial coalition of left-wing forces, primarily composing of moderate social-democrats, socialists and vanguardists. Despite the conflicting views held by the factions they remain a united force primarily thanks to Khrushchev, whose cult like following amongst the peasantry has allowed himself and his allies to coerce the moderates into remaining loyal. For now Khrushchev has held back on previous radical promises such as the abolishment of the monarchy in order to appease the social democratic majority who wish for progressive change, his increasingly vague stances have helped maintain the Front’s unity whilst not completely rejecting the will of his hardcore supporters. The social-democratic majority also serves as a tool used by Khrushchev to appeal to Vasyl who would surely oppose co-operation had the vanguardists been given a larger platform."
ukraine.83.a:0 "Let us see how long this lasts..."
ukraine.84.t:0 "The New Ukraine"
ukraine.84.d:0 "Once defined by its peasantry dominated agricultural society, Ukraine was always a battle-ground between Russian and European influence and control. Previously lacking a respectable government that put the Ukrainian people first, the tryrannical German bootlicking monarchy is no more. The old backwards Ukraine is no more. Thanks to Comrade Khruschev the Ukranian state is rapidly industrialising and modernising. Although set back by Kulak resistance and mismanagement of collective farming, the nation has rebounded with a centralised economic plan based upon the ever growing factories that now dominate the farmland. The future of Ukraine is now!"
ukraine.84.a:0 "Without Comrade Khrushchev there would be no new Ukraine!"
ukraine.85.t:0 "The Coronation"
ukraine.85.d:0 "Due to the nature of Vasyl's death, his successor was unable to have a proper coronation. That was, until today when [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was crowned King of all the Ukrainians by Metropolitan Mykola Boretsky in the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Today is a great day for all Ukrainians as we finally rid ourselves of the legacy of the old Kingdom."
ukraine.85.a:0 "What an exciting event!"
ukraine.86.t:0 "Mikhail Bulgakov Arrested!"
ukraine.86.d:0 "With our recent crackdown against the terrorist organisation 'Faith and Nation' better known as ViN in full swing, our loyal police officers have raided a suspected ViN safehouse and arrested the organisation's leader, Mikhail Bulgakov. With him arrested, the organisation will likely crumble without any leadership."
ukraine.86.a:0 "Death to the enemies of the state!"

ukraine.87.d:0 "With our recent crackdown against the terrorist Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists better known as the OUN in full swing, our loyal police officers have raided a suspected OUN safehouse and arrested the organisation's leader, Dmytro Dontsov.

UKR_Our_Future:0 "Our Future"
UKR_Our_Future_desc:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, those loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, pro-Russian forces and Nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists mobilise their supporters all over the country..."

UKR_Invite_Khrushchev:0 "Invite Khrushchev Into Government"
UKR_Invite_Khrushchev_desc:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a well-known but controversial Ukrainian social-democrat, proposes the populist idea, very popular among the peasants, of the reorganisation of our agriculture. We have to admit, that that this proposition seems like it can help Ukraine in her time of crisis. Maybe we should invite him into government to implement these reforms?"
UKR_Popular_Front:0 "Popular Front"
UKR_Popular_Front_desc:0 "Though we have given Khrushchev free reign to reorganise the economy, many of our legislators in the Rada have prevented any attempt by Khrushchev to reduce the power of the Kulak landlords. That's why Khrushchev has announced a creation of the 'Popular Front', which will unite left members of the Supreme Rada and give him enough authority to change the laws."
UKR_Language_Issue:0 "Solve The Language Issue"
UKR_Language_Issue_desc:0 "The Russian language is widespread in Ukraine and the native tongue of many of our citizens, but it has never been an official state language. If we grant Russian a formal role in the Ukrainian state, it will allow us to gain popularity among pro-Russian citizens and solve one of the divisive issues our nation faces."
UKR_Exp_Kulaks:0 "Expropriate Kulak Holdings"
UKR_Exp_Kulaks_desc:0 "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are hated by the majority of the peasants, we can easily expropriate they lands and divide them between the poorest peasants in the country."
UKR_Tax_Kulaks:0 "Increase Kulak Taxation"
UKR_Tax_Kulaks_desc:0 "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are the only group of the farmers that are still able to fulfil our consumer needs, it would be wise to let them have their lands, but to impose an additional tax on them."
UKR_Coll_Prog:0 "Collectivisation"
UKR_Coll_Prog_desc:0 "After the latest agricultural crisis among the 'Kulaks', we have many new poor peasants all over Ukraine. Khrushchev proposes that they can work on new collective farms and produce goods for the state, which will provide them with farming tools and pay them a reasonable salary. This should hopefully, through pooling of resources, boost our total output."
UKR_Fate_Monarchy:0 "Fate of the Monarchy"
UKR_Fate_Monarchy_desc:0 "King Vasily has become somewhat of a laughing stock to the Ukrainian people. By handing major powers to Krushchev and seeing more issues solved in months than the King himself had resolved in years he has only highlighted his own irrelevance. A former Austrian puppet king with no Austrian backing, his position is being openly debated by Popular Front members."
UKR_Syn_Rev:0 "A Red Hetman"
UKR_Syn_Rev_desc:0 "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Nikita Khrushchev and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
UKR_Friendship_Nations:0 "Unite the People"
UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc:0 "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Khrushchev is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of unity amongst all citizens of this great nation!"
UKR_Khrushchyovka:0 "'Khrushchyovka'"
UKR_Khrushchyovka_desc:0 "'Khrushchyovka' is the unofficial designation for a type of low-cost, concrete-panelled three to five-storied apartment building developed at the request of our leader Nikita Khrushchev. Mass production of these structures should finally solve the housing problem in the rapidly expanding Ukrainian cities and will provide more employment and accommodation to the masses."
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev:0 "Purge Khrushchev"
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev_desc:0 "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Krushchev and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman's backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

UKR_comrade_devotion:0 "Comrade Devotion"
UKR_comrade_devotion_desc:0 "Ukraine is whole once more, the nation united in support of Khrushchev’s policies, this nation-wide strive for excellence has created an atmosphere of hard work. Across Ukraine in factories, farms, mines, ports, stores there are dedicated workers forging a new Ukraine!"
UKR_wealth_distribute:0 "Distribute Our New Wealth"
UKR_wealth_distribute_desc:0 "Profits gained from the new Kulak taxes will be distributed amongst the poorer labourers in order to decrease economic division. Providing workers with a higher income will boost popularity for Khrushchev and raise the living standards for many. Greed has polluted the nation, it is time for equality for all!"
UKR_new_society:0 "New Ukrainian Society"
UKR_new_society_desc:0 "A nation of true freedom, happiness and equality! A united proletariat represented both in the fields labouring and in the government dictating. Now we can declare the foundation of a new nation, one that is directed by socialism!"
UKR_peasant_army:0 "Revolutionary Peasants' Army"
UKR_peasant_army_desc:0 "The military of the Ukranian state was mostly composed of reactionary and nationalist commanders, when comrade Khrushchev seized power many of these generals refused to serve under a socialist republican. Therefore Khrushchev has restructured the military into a mass fighting force of proletariat, they may lack in experience whoever they are loyal comrades!"


UKR_Broad_Coalition:0 "Coalition With The Nationalists"
UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc:0 "Realising the scale of the Syndicalist threat, Hetman Skoropadsky decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'OUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadsky's regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
UKR_Rightist_Government:0 "Initial Administrative Reforms"
UKR_Rightist_Government_desc:0 "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are underway."
UKR_ViN_Russophiles:0 "Church and Nation"
UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc:0 "It seems that Mikhail Bulgakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
UKR_OUN_Nationalists:0 "Requisition Polish Farms"
UKR_OUN_Nationalists_desc:0 "A number of Polish landlords control land in Western and Central Ukraine for historical reasons. Since Poland is decidedly weak now, we can easily confiscate their estates, expel these Poles, and redistribute their lands among the Ukrainian peasants. This should also coincidentally appeal to nationalist supporters of both stripes that generally detest the Polish minority."
UKR_Abolish_Law:0 "Recognise Russian"
UKR_Abolish_Law_desc:0 "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mikhail Bulgakov is now able to abolish this language law."
UKR_Prosvita_Mov:0 "The Prosvita Movement"
UKR_Prosvita_Mov_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population use the Russian language despite the fact that the government doesn't recognise it at a state level for use in national institutions. To combat this, 'OUN' has proposed to invest in a 'Prosvita' ('Education') movement. The aim of 'Prosvita' is to spread Ukrainian language and culture throughout the country, as well as abroad."
UKR_Free_Trade:0 "Eastern Free Trade Area"
UKR_Free_Trade_desc:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
UKR_Resettlement:0 "Resettlement"
UKR_Resettlement_desc:0 "The Ukrainian nation is still divided, even though Ukraine itself has been an independent country for almost 20 years. We should address this situation by resettling peasants from Western Ukraine to the East, where they will become workers in the Donbass industrial region. This also will also serve to bring Ukrainian ideas and traditions into this unfriendly 'OUN' region."
UKR_Crisis_Coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc:0 "Though the Syndicalist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'OUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour. This situation cannot continue as the situation in Europe is quickly deteriorating."

UKR_Dissolve_Rada:0 "Dissolve the Rada"
UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc:0 "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadsky's policies as Hetman. The King has been shaken out of his legislative stupor to grant Skoropadsky the authority to dissolve the Rada and form instead a loyal State Senate, stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions."
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy:0 "Ukrainian Unity"
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc:0 "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
UKR_Army_Reforms:0 "A Professional Army"
UKR_Army_Reforms_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Ukrainian army is incomparable to the Russian and German behemoths, and yet it is still stronger than any neighbouring army. That's why Skoropadsky has proposed re-orientating our army towards a smaller professional force. It will help us maintain our security, and will allow us to reduce our costly defence spending."
UKR_Peasant_State:0 "Peasant State"
UKR_Peasant_State_desc:0 "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy. With extra money available from our reduced military spending, we can reduce taxes for the poor until our agriculture recovers from Black Monday and we will become the breadbasket of Europe once again."
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism:0 "Prohibit Syndicalism"
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism_desc:0 "We have reached an understanding with the pro-Russian circles, pacified the various Ukrainian movements and helped make the peasantry loyal to us. Now we have to deal with the Syndicalists. Our mass media will start a massive propaganda campaign, showing the Syndies as a malignant tumour on Slavdom. Our efforts will eventually enable us to ban many notorious left parties."
UKR_Federalisation:0 "Federalisation"
UKR_Federalisation_desc:0 "The Syndicalists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Supreme Rada, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."

UKR_New_Heir:0 "The Succession Question"
UKR_New_Heir_desc:0 "King Vasily, as vigorous in his production of heirs as in running the country, has left the royal succession up for debate. There are only two realistic contenders, Leo Stefan Habsburg or Daniil Skoropadsky. Neither are completely ideal but this question must be solved sooner rather than later."
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper:0 "Explosion on the Dnieper"
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper_desc:0 "The death of the King has come as a shock to us all, and now one question remains - in what direction will our nation travel in the aftermath?"
UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty:0 "Treaty of Pereyaslav"
UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty_desc:0 "With Russian nationalists in charge of the Ukrainian government, the option is now available for us to petition the Russian government for reintegration back into Mother Russia. There is no guarantee that they would risk incurring Germany's wrath by accepting us however."
UKR_OUN_Embargo:0 "Embargo Germany"
UKR_OUN_Embargo_desc:0 "With Ukrainian nationalists dominating the government, the time has come to put the Ukrainian people first - by taking a serious gamble. For too long our nation's economy and agricultural sector has been geared towards serving the Germany people at our own expense. This will end. Protectionism is the only way we can assert ourselves."
UKR_Grand_Coronation:0 "A Grand Coronation"
UKR_Grand_Coronation_desc:0 "With the Kingdom finally becoming stable once more it has been proposed that a second and grand coronation inside Saint Sophia's Cathedral be prepared. Unfortunately due to the political turmoil following Vasyl's death, [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was unable to receive a proper coronation. This will be rectified at once."
UKR_Ban_ViN:0 "Ban ViN"
UKR_Ban_ViN_desc:0 "The so-called 'Faith and Nation' organisation is little more than a front for russophilic traitors and if they were in power they would see us annexed into the old Empire. With Dontsov assuming the mantle of government it is time to permanently rid ourselves of these treacherous scum."
UKR_Ban_OUN:0 "Ban The OUN"
UKR_Ban_OUN_desc:0 "The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, often referred to as the OUN, has become something of a problem in recent years. With its fervent anti-German rhetoric, they could become a dangerous enemy and the most simplest way to deal with them is ban them and crack down on their operations."
UKR_New_Scientists:0 "New Scientists"
UKR_New_Scientists_desc:0 "The main aim of our government has always been stability. With a new atmosphere of relative calm descending on the nation our young people are moving into the sciences and many companies are investing into research. We can only support this process."
UKR_Extend_State_Powers:0 "Extend The Executive Powers"
UKR_Extend_State_Powers_desc:0 "The executive powers have always been a bit too weak and this allowed the left-leaning Rada to dominate state affairs. But with the new government in place it is time to extend them so as to create a greater and stronger Ukrainian state."
UKR_Discredit_Democrats:0 "Discredit Moderate Republicanism"
UKR_Discredit_Democrats_desc:0 "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine have attacked and criticised our rule for various reasons and harken back to the short-lived people's republic. Their influence must be curbed and the legacy of the UNR slandered in the minds of all Ukrainians."
UKR_State_Companies:0 "State Backed Companies"
UKR_State_Companies_desc:0 "As the economy begins to grow again we can begin investing in state-backed companies to further our already healthy industrial output and sheild the economy from any further downward trends."
UKR_Secret_Police:0 "The Bureau Of Special Investigations"
UKR_Secret_Police_desc:0 "With the last few years being tumultous at best it has been decided that a new kind of police force must be established. One that will strike from the shadows and monitor those extremists in the syndicalists who would see our state crumble."

UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery:0 "Begin Ukrainian Recovery"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc:0 "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Syndicalist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
UKR_First_Loan:0 "German Loan For Electrification"
UKR_First_Loan_desc:0 "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods. They must understand that the situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help us, since we secure German interests in the East."
UKR_First_TaxHike:0 "Taxes For The Electrification"
UKR_First_TaxHike_desc:0 "We must use our own resources and raise taxes, since there is no other way to get investment for the programme of the electrification of the villages in the Central Ukraine. We hope that our peasants will understand us."
UKR_Electrification:0 "New Resources"
UKR_Electrification_desc:0 "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Now we also need more resources, to fuel our nation's recovery and create the tools to do it."
UKR_Second_Loan:0 "German Loan For Industrialisation"
UKR_Second_Loan_desc:0 "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it's time to do something in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. But we need investment and technological support from our ally in Berlin!"
UKR_Second_TaxHike:0 "Taxes For The Industrialisation"
UKR_Second_TaxHike_desc:0 "Electricity is available all over the Central Ukraine - now it's time to rebuild industry in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. And that's why we have to raise taxes. Again."
UKR_Kharkov_Industry:0 "Kharkov Industrial Zone"
UKR_Kharkov_Industry_desc:0 "Kharkov has always been one of the most populated cities in Ukraine, but we have never used this advantage in our economy. Now is a perfect time to launch the formation of a new industrial region in the Kharkov region and finally make our industry strong!"
UKR_Revive_Agriculture:0 "Revive Agriculture"
UKR_Revive_Agriculture_desc:0 "Our main aim was to turn Ukraine into the breadbasket of Europe and an indispensable partner to Germany and the Reichspakt. On the contrary, we became even more dependent on German goods after Black Monday and our trade deficit widened significantly. Now we must reconstruct our national agriculture market, using our industry and new agricultural tools, to end this sorry state of affairs."
UKR_Donbass_Industry:0 "Rejuvenate Donbass Factories"
UKR_Donbass_Industry_desc:0 "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable, and we have a good chance to continue reforms. Our long-term aim is to develop industry in the East of Ukraine. Thanks to the Tsarist regime, we just have to re-open old Donbass factories and modernise them a little or launch the formation of a new industrial region."

UKR_Stab_econ:0 "Stabilisation"
UKR_Stab_econ_desc:0 "Thanks to our elaborate measures, we revived our economy and mitigated the consequences of the Black Monday for Ukraine. We can hope that our economy will soon prove itself to be competitive throughout Europe."

UKR_Reorg_army:0 "New Ukrainian Army"
UKR_Reorg_army_desc:0 "The army of Ukraine is in as poor condition as the Kingdom itself. Although the Black Monday crisis made us reduce the military budget, we still have enough money to launch new reforms, which will allow us to reorganise the Ministry of Defence. It's time to assert our independent military might and secure our borders from Ukraine's numerous rivals."
UKR_Mobile:0 "Chernyakhovsky Plan"
UKR_Mobile_desc:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky is an young ambitious colonel who has already understood that future wars would be won by heavy industry and machines.

UKR_Mobile_Forces:0 "Trucks For The Fatherland"
UKR_Mobile_Forces_desc:0 "Trucks are very important for any modern army - that's why we have to use our industry and build a new model of truck. This should allow us to end our dependence on horse cavalry and cease to be a laughing stock to our major regional foes."
UKR_Tank_Forces:0 "Tanks of the Steppe"
UKR_Tank_Forces_desc:0 "One tank can replace more than ten soldiers on the battlefield - that's why we have to build as many tanks as we can to create one of the strongest armies in Eastern Europe. The wide plains of Ukraine are the perfect environment for their use. We cannot pass this opportunity up."
UKR_Grand_Battle:0 "An Encircled Nation"
UKR_Grand_Battle_desc:0 "Unfortunately, due to our geographical position our enemies are unlikely to disappear as swiftly as 'water in the Sun' as our national anthem states. Despite this we can still be ready for an any unfriendly action if we prepare our battle plans beforehand. Let's do it!"
UKR_Firepower:0 "Thunder and Lightning"

UKR_Doct1_desc:0 "A number of wars have happened since the proclamation of our independence in 1918. Russia, China, Central America, Afrika and Brazil. Now is the time we must rethink the lessons these campaigns can teach us to understand our own army's failings and possible remedies."
UKR_Art1:0 "Support Artillery"
UKR_Art1_desc:0 "Artillery is very important for any modern army, but its integration into infantry divisions is vital. We have to do everything we can to analyse the advantages that artillery can bring to the Ukrainian army."
UKR_Massive:0 "A Peasant Army"

UKR_Massive_inf1:0 "A Gun For Every Man"
UKR_Massive_inf1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg led to the invention of many arms that revolutionised warfare. However, they must be improved and sent to our soldiers as well as the new cheap, but rapid firing rifles and carbines."
UKR_Massive_inf2:0 "A Man For Every Gun"
UKR_Massive_inf2_desc:0 "We have already spent a lot of time creating equipment for various purposes. But our army claims that the equipment is still not perfect for the needs of the soldiers and officers."
UKR_Massive_doct:0 "Troop Doctrines"
UKR_Massive_doct_desc:0 "We have many soldiers and many rifles. Some might argue that such an army is weaker than a modern military resplendent with tanks and artillery galore. This could be true, but we will definitely find out which is superior on the battlefield."
UKR_New_Army_UKR:0 "A Reorganised Army"
UKR_New_Army_UKR_desc:0 "Finally, the army of Ukraine has been reorganised by the Ministry of Defence and our General Staff. It seems that the army which had been formed after 1918 to maintain the independence of Ukraine has finally come into its own."

UKR_Newforpol:0 "A Global Ukraine"
UKR_Newforpol_desc:0 "Ukraine has made great strides towards rebooting its frail economy and political systems, and now is the time to pay attention to reorientating our foreign policy.

UKR_Ostwall_focus_desc:0 "Our role in the Reichspakt has been, and always will be, to help secure the Eastern flank of the alliance. It has become increasingly clear that we can't do that alone.

Irrespective of this hard truth we still have our brave and numerous citizens, who stand ready to work hard and defend Ukraine from the various enemies who want to enslave them!

UKR_Fra_cooperation:0 "Commune Cooperation"
UKR_Fra_cooperation_desc:0 "The Commune of France is the torch of progress and liberty in Europe. Fortunately Nikita Khrushchev understands that the future belongs to this young and free nation.

UKR_Fra_alliance:0 "Solidarity Forever"
UKR_Fra_alliance_desc:0 "With Ukraine finally free from German capitalist oppression we can now freely decide our stance towards the international community. The immediate alliance with other Syndicalist nations can be very profitable for us, and will finally secure Ukraine from the aggression of the Germans, who don't want to forget about the fail of their puppet king. We should ask France for an alliance."
UKR_Fra_claims:0 "Red Liberation"
UKR_Fra_claims_desc:0 "Lots of the Ukrainian lands are still under control of various regimes which don't always respect all the rights of the Ukrainians in their countries.

UKR_RUS_friendship:0 "Northern Wind"
UKR_RUS_friendship_desc:0 "We didn't forget our brothers in the north. Though the traitors in 1918 tried to tear apart our ties with Russia the people of Ukraine did their best to restore them.

monsocukr.1.d:0 "This morning at 8 sharp, King Vasyl I was shot and killed during his daily morning walk. Long preferring to walk alone without his usual accompaniment of guards, the fact something like this did not happen early is a bit shocking. The assassin, apprehended as soon as the shots were heard, was a member of the banned Communist Party of Ukraine, led by one Nikita Khrushchev, long an opponent of our regime. Despite this, the King's death could not come at a more opportune time. Although supportive of our reforms, the King had yet to fully embrace the rebirth of the revolution. With his death, Leo Stefan von Habsburg, not yet even a teenager, has been chosen by our government to replace the late King. Due to him still having years before he can fully take on his responsibilities, Leo Stefan, now King Lev II, is a perfect match, as he can be shown the truths of our ideals and policies. The Kingdom may mourn the death of her late King, but with his death comes a new dawn for the nation, under the dual rural of the Monarchy and the People's Government."

Charged with conspiracy to assassinate the late King, the trial is a forgone conclusion. While all will get a chance to speak, present evidence and defend themselves, all know that  the Khrushchevites are doomed to swing.\n\nThe trial itself was a simple affair, and hearkened back to the various show trials that the Bolsheviks carried out in the final days of the Soviet uprising.  Each and every man was convicted of treason, with the rope waiting for Khrushchev and others. What's more, the KMS has been formally banned, it's assets seized and turned over to the People's Government. While this was a small step, it is a necessary one, for to truly revitalize the nation, the rot must be purged out."

Wishing to build a syndicalist state within a revived Ukraine is the gist of the their policy, and the similarities between our own program is quite striking. Seeing as how we both find ourselves adrift in a sea of hostile ideologies, it has been agreed that both of our parties should merge, allowing us to implement our programs all the easier. Mykhailo Yalovy, our foreign minister, is a personal friend of Shumsky, thus making the merger all the easier.\n\nThis merger is, of course, not just for convenience, it also allows us to keep a closer eye on Shumsky, as he is seen as a threat to our rule.

Be it promotion of events featuring famous works of art, state sponsored food expos, or funding the arts in general, we shall not rest until Ukraine's culture is revived! While this may draw the ire of Russiphiles in the East and the Poles in the west, we know our cause is just.

Be it the subjaction of our people, the attempts to force us to become Russians or even the near-destruction of our culture, we have suffered more at the hands of the Russians then anyone else. No Longer! With a government that truly cares for the people finally in power within Ukraine, we shall reverse the table. Those Russians foolish enough to our lands shall be forced out, and driven back to 'Mother Russia.' Our Eastern lands shall be purified, and the same horror they inflicted on us will be inflicted upon them. When the time finally comes for us to stand against the Bear, we shall hold the line, for we know that a truly free Ukraine, by the People for the People, lives and dies with us!"

monsocukr.6.t:0 "To Arms for Ukraine!"
monsocukr.6.d:0 "In the history of our great nation, figures such as Vladimir the Great stand out as true heros to the national cause, These figures are known to every true son of Ukraine, and their model still serves as perfect examples for our armed forces. Bohdan Khmelnytsky is one such man. Fighting against the oppressive rule of the Poles, Khmelnytsky's might established a free nation that we are the inheritors of such. In emulation of his legacy, and the government's own promotion of men such like him, various militias of peasants have formed, and have begun attacking and seizing land from Polish nobles that inhabit the west of our country. While these raids have been fairly tame, it cannot be said they don't show what a rallied up people can do. Within the sized lands, the former palaces of the landowning Poles have been transformed into massive schools, greatly increasing education within our rural population. What's more, the land sized has actually been handed over to government control by the people, giving us the chance to see it divided up correctly. With more raids planned or ongoing, it seems the people have finally found an outlet for years of oppression."
monsocukr.6.a:0 "A victory for the masses!"

monsocukr.7.t:0 "Terrorist Activity in Bessarabia!"
monsocukr.7.d:0 "Bessarabia has long been one of most contested areas of land, claimed  by both the Russians and Ukrainians, thus it is no surprise that both have hungrily eyed the land since the end of the Weltkrieg. While both have waited for a moment of weakness, waiting for us to slip up so they could size Bessarabia out from under us. It seems however, that this period of relative peace has ended. Over the course of the past few days, a string of terror attacks, carried out by what appears to be a contingent of Cossacks fighting what they claim is a 'modern day Yasir for the Ukrainian population in Bessarabia.'\n\nWhile we have no evidence besides hearsay, it is believed these Cossacks are agents of the 'Monarcho-Socialist' government in Kiev. Seemingly confirming this, Kiev has offered to subdue these terrorists, in exchange for 'temporary authority' over Bessarabia. In other words, they are demanding we hand over Bessarabia or the attacks will continue, if not all out war between our two nations. While such a war would no doubt be easily won, many within our government are calling for us to cave to Ukraine and to focus on reclaiming the rest of Greater Romania, saying we can always get the land back later. Whatever our choice, we must do something quickly, before even more lives are lost. "
monsocukr.7.a:0 "It will take more then terrorists for us to hand over our land!"

monsocukr.8.t:0 "Failure of Operation Muromets"
monsocukr.8.d:0 "Despite our best attempts, our convert efforts to get Romanian to hand over Bessarabia peacefully, also known as Operation Muromets, has failed. Despite having no direct evidence to link our government to the various terrorist attacks and cells that formed as a result of our actions, the Romanian government clearly seems to know it was us, and has issued a stern 'warning' that any attempts to restore order within Bessarabia by our troops would be seen as an act of war. While the Operation was clearly a failure, that doesn't mean we can't capitalize on the chaos that reigns in Bessarabia to quickly seize it from Romania will a small war. Regardless, the operation was a failure, and the only remaining avenue to capture the land is by war, if that war comes sooner or later remains to be seen however."
monsocukr.8.a:0 "Death to Romania! We march for Greater Ukraine!"
monsocukr.8.b:0 "They've won this round, we'll be back..."

monsocukr.9.t:0 "An Offer from the South"
monsocukr.9.d:0 "Much like ourselves, the government of Ukraine has recently taken a great leap forward, emerging as a predominant People's Government under the watchful eye of their King. Just like us, they have fallen adrift in a sea of conflicting ideologies and movements, however unlike when we first took up the mantle of the King and the People, a grouping of like minded nations exists, that of course being us and our Union of People's Crowns. Seeking to latch onto a nation that shares ideals, the Ukrainian Government has formally petitioned to join the Union of People's Crowns. Promising access to their vast grain resources, the Ukrainian delegation has promised that there is nothing to lose by granting them membership in the Union. Despite this, many wonder if they have alternative motives in this request, thus bringing their motivation for  joining into question."
monsocukr.9.a:0 "Of course! Long live the People's Crowns!"
monsocukr.9.b:0 "What has Ukraine ever done for us? Rejected!"

monsocukr.10.t:0 "A Disappointing Response"
monsocukr.10.d:0 "Much to our disappointment, the People's Government of White Ruthenia has denined our request to join the Union of People's Crowns. While unexpected, this is expected to have little effect on the nation overall. Despite this, we once again find ourselves alone, with our backs to the wall. May God protect the Union, for we cannot."
monsocukr.10.a:0 "A setback for sure, but one we can recover from."

monsocukr.11.t:0 "The East Ablaze" 
monsocukr.11.d:0 "As predicted, the Russians and Russophiles who inhabit the east of our nation have not taken kindly to our efforts to remove their perfidious influence. What started as a series of spontaneous protests against our anti-russian policies has turned into riots, and in the worst case, all out insurgency. While this violence has no chance of succeeding in anything more then property damage,  it is a sign of just how deep the Bear was able to sink it's claws into our nation. The armed forces are already preparing a plan to pacify the East; Those who rebel will be given two choices, return home and accept the righteous of the King and the People's Government, or be driven to Russia, where they can finally be united with the 'Motherland'. Those who resist even this most generous offer will face our full wrath, knowing what it means to face the People's justice. Either way, by the time we are done, Ukraine shall finally be free of the Russian Bear, after so long a time."
monsocukr.11.a:0 "Resistance is futile."
