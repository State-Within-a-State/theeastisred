At the time of its organization, disagreements had already risen on the necessity of peasant support for the revolution. Such differences would be exacerbated by the imprisonment of many of the leaders of the party after the 1931 Labor Day. When pardons were eventually accepted by the imprisoned leaders, a new party would be formed, led by peasant organizers and worker-intellectuals who had studied the works of Marx and their peasant associations and unions.§!"

PHI_skadal_revolt_legacy_desc:0 "Founded as a peasant movement in the late 1920’s & early 1930s, the Sakdalista movement was a relatively popular movement during the insular government years. With independence in 1935, the group would support the National Socialist Party in the first national elections. With the loss of the 1935 election. On May 2nd 1935, with the alleged support from foreign actors like Japan, the Sakdalistas would attempt a revolt thinking that the rest of the nation would help their cause in creating an independent Philippines. But this would not be the case, as the movement would be crushed by the government forces, forcing its leader Beningo Ramos into exile. Despite crushing the movement, its rapid growth shows the strength of dissatisfaction among the population. Some sort of action must be taken, to prevent the growth of another movement that might grow using the same causes."

rd_phil.0.title:0 "A Path Towards Independence"
rd_phil.0.desc:0 "The Philippines were a Spanish colony until late 1898, when the United States claimed them as a war prize from Spain. Years of violent struggle for independence followed, and as the economic and political crisis in America began to worsen, they finally bore fruit. The Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act would face a lengthy journey that would eventually be rejected by the Philippine Senate. In 1934, after the 1932 United States presidential election failed to create an electoral majority, the Tydings-McDuffie Act would be passed, and then accepted by the Philippine Senate, creating the Commonwealth of the Philippines with an elected government and a constitution based upon that of the United States, while Washington retained control of the country's foreign affairs and military. More importantly, it stipulated that after ten years of transition, the archipelago would become a fully independent republic. But storm clouds are gathering over America. Will the Philippines achieve independence sooner than expected, and will that lead to them becoming prey for yet another major empire? Only time will tell..."

rd_phil.17.desc:0 "How can we then, as God fearing people, combat communism and its evil influences? Satan, the father of all evil and his co-workers started communism and it will take the God of all that is God of all that is good to pave the way to combat communism and that God is none other than Our Master EQUI FRILI BRIUM. General Moncado has served as a beacon to his followers. He has taught us to love God for God is love and has shown us the ways and means of combating Satan's evil influences, namely communism. It is wonder then, that we look upon him as our Master, Our Living God, Our Living Philosopher, Our Living Hero? Through Our Master's help and guidance, we have found that through idleness Satan's influences can penetrate the human mind and control your whole being. For this reason, Our Master have taught us never to be idle but always to be on the alert both mentally and physically and consequently we have turned to golfing to help us lead clean and wholesome lives.\n\nBy possessing general confidence, general ego, and general conceit, the golf player can consider himself ruler of the situation and with the golf club as his or her gun, the golf ball as his ammunition and the golf course as a battlefield, he is ready for action. It is important in actual warfare for our soldiers of battle to be on the position he takes. The way he handles the golf club or gun as well as his aim, are the determination factors of battle. General Moncado's principles are EQUALITY, FRATERNITY, and BROTHERHOOD. He learned these principles while studying in the college of Mystery in India at the age of six years. These are also the binding forces which united the 50 states called United States of America. These divine principles brought into being the famous Constitution, the highest law of the land into the life of every American which in the process of time developed the precious American Way of Life. Under Moncado's philosophy, golfing is one of the many ways to fight and defeat communism. He believes that communism begins in every individual person. Therefore, the battle against it must begin from that individual. He defined communism as a disease, ills, germs, vices, etc. If one wishes to be successful in his fight against communism, he must free himself from all forms of vices which are destructive to his physical fitness. If we go under the sun all the time, our physical bodies, mental bodies will all have the power to defeat any type of disease, germs, or other forms of ailments. Through golfing, we are always breathing fresh air, which is essential to maintain good, healthy bodies. Also, golfing brings man closer to nature and other elements who man owes so much for his struggle to live. Nature is obedient to God. Remember, man lost his life and status in God's paradise through disobedience. The only way to regain what he had lost there is to live with nature and let her guide him.\n\nThese moral principles we have learned from General Moncado through golfing can also be applied to our country's physical, social or political existence. We all know that our government is a Democracy. And that democracy, as we understand is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Above all, Democracy means that there is God. Communism means that there is no God. Therefore, under the leadership of General Moncado, his thousands of followers in the United States of America, Alaska, Philippines and Hawaii, everyone of them is behind the General in his fight against Communism and all forms of evils that will destroy the American Way of Life. As a student of geometry and physics in colleges and universities in the United States, and because he wants to contribute something to the field of the sports toward the perfection of golf, he painfully spent time in analyzing toward the types of swings in golf, as applied to the principle of geometry and physics. He finally catalogued under the title "360 degrees Power Swing" four swings. Isn't it true that par is associated with golf? Par is equal or an equality in value or standing. In golf, if a player made a par, it means he is equal to green or to the course requiring the same number of strokes. Therefore, in golfing the members learned not only the Way of Equality, but also the truth of Fraternity, and the life of Liberty, and these are the principles of Christ, Our Lord, according to the record: He said, "I am the Way, the truth, and the Life." If Jesus Christ were still alive today, he would encourage his disciples and followers to play golf because it is a game that teaches EQUALITY. One more thing. Why is a golfer given a handicap? Because it is possible that the expert and the less able among themselves, play on the same course. In golfing, where the principle of 360 degrees Power Swing is involved the members are learning the value of good sportsmanship and the highest consideration for others. They have also found that you alone must master yourself in attaining its fullest pleasures and benefits of the game. Communism means evil. Evil means vices. Vices means disease. Disease means death. Therefore, we are fighting communism or disease through golfing, so that this beautiful instrument of God in his wisdom shall live and continue to live as a human mechanism. Life is the reward of those who accept and believe the Man's Moral Concept that man and God are equal. "Fighting Communism through golfing" became the battle cry of every member of the Moncado Crusaders Golf Club since its inception. It may sound strange for a golf club to adopt such a phrase but it reminds them always of the big struggle between democracy and communistic ideology. Also, it inspires them to fight for American-style Democracy and to defeat the godless Communism. If these godless creatures happen to be on the golf course, the Crusaders are ready to face them."

rd_phil.18.title:0 "The Shining New City of Jerusalem" 
rd_phil.18.desc:0 "Under General Moncado's philosophy, Equifrilibricum is a man; man who believed that there is God on earth. The American people or the Filipino people are men who both believed in an Equifrilibricum which means equality, fraternity, and liberty. Because of these principles, Patrick Henry, the great American was inspired to speak fearlessly before his compatriots his glowing, famous, and everlasting phrase, " Give me liberty or give me death."\n\nMan made in the image and likeness of his Creator - God, is willing to die for his principle. His principle provides him with unlimited protection, making him One and Equal with God. "I and my Father are One or Man and God are equal," when fully realized, no one could destroy or overcome him. Because of the principles of Equifrilibricum, the American founding Fathers were inspired that in our Constitution we find those immortal phrase...... "that under God men are created equal.\n\nEquifrilibricum is the foundation of a true democracy in the world. A true democracy is a form of government of the people by the people, and for the people. Equifrilibricum was the principle of the American people, by the American People and for the American people. Yet, the American people failed principles as the words of Satan grew in the hearts of evil. But Moncado is standing by America and he is with America and for America. In other words, the United States of America is the "Human Mechanism of God Christ in his wisdom and serving the world for the love of humanity." As long as America lives, Moncado also lives, because Moncado loves America and the American Way of Life. Yet its legacy has been stained and the American Way of Life has also destroyed by the Godless people so that the world is no longer fit for man to line in. We will all become like Animals fighting, killing, and eating one another. Even as Equifrilibricum has grown on our islands, Moncado still wishes to bring America back from its recent Godliness, to make America live up to the ideals of God that its founding Fathers sought to uphold."

rd_phil.22.title:0 "Flight of the Manananggals!" 
rd_phil.22.desc:0 "A recent arrival to the scene of Philippine organized crime, the Bahala-na Gang, has taken advantage of the chaotic political and economic climate to muscle its way into the scene of racketeering, contract killing, and movement of illegal weapons and drugs. The gang's leader, Divino Talastas, having recently won a power struggle following the violent death of his brother Emong at the hands of Manila police, has held a particular vendetta against the police - somewhat understandable despite his violence as events leading up to his brother's life of crime were marked by constant harassment by the police. President Racuyal has been sympathetic to such stories, and is working tirelessly to root out corruption and undue aggression in nationwide police forces - but all the same, crime is crime, and the president isn't about to stop his crusade for anything. Today, in the muggy pre-dawn hours of Manila's Sampaloc neighborhood, the hub of Bahala-na activity, a swarm of buzzing VIBLANDI helicopters roused residents from their sleep. Surprised by the sudden arrival of police from the sky, the members of the Bahala-na Gang were caught off-guard and disarmed with a surprising lack of violence. Premises were entered and searched, and a number of firearms and narcotics were seized. Most notable to bystanders, and the gang members themselves, was the surprising lack of brutality on the part of the police, which left the members dumbstruck - until the seeming explanation revealed its-, or him-, self to them: President Racuyal. Having made good on his promise to attend the helicopter raids himself, President Racuyal has been insistent (apparently, according to police brass, to an annoying degree) on police restraining their conduct, and catching more flies with honey than vinegar as it were. Overall, confusing as the operation was, it has been declared a success by the president, and even the police have to admit the surprise of the raid worked in their favor. They have also been forced to admit that the restraint in their conduct, and the personal outreach of the president to many of the gang's members, was the most successful element of the raid, with the gang's activity overall decreasing in severity, and some members even beginning to regularly attend therapy sessions at the new nationwide clinic network."

rd_phil.23.desc:0 "Another day, another racketeer or gangster to bust. Pascual Racuyal and the police, riding high off the success of the first helicopter raid, have wasted no time assembling their forces and equipment for a second operation. This time, their target is a familiar face to Luzon, but a new arrival to organized crime: Faustino Fabros. Born in Ilocos Sur on the west coast of Luzon, Fabros is a former serviceman in the Filipino constabulary who would find himself an auxiliary in the American military actions in the Caribbean, and then in Salinas, California, where he would form a racketeering association with several Filipino compatriots. With the crisis setting in the United States, Fabros and his compatriots found themselves under constant assault by various political militias. Though they could have, at great cost, maintained their presence and power in Salinas, the outfit would see better fit to relocate to the greater Manila region, where they would indeed find themselves well suited to carve out their niche among the feuding hacienda families and petty street gangs in the region. So it was for several years, until today, when the president's swarm of VIBLANDI helicopters and police descended from the sky to put a stop to them. Indeed, it was considered a great success! The Ilocono Ring had been locked out of the local information loop due to their standoff with traditional hacienda players, the raid ended with the arrest of all the ring's leaders, and the gang's rank and file and muscle were all but completely disarmed in one fell swoop. There was a black mark upon an otherwise clockwork mission however: the president nearly died. VIBLANDI helicopters have, so far, been effective, but there have been more than a few incidents in training for these missions which have resulted in a number of injuries, and three fatalities when an officer lost control of his VIBLANDI and killed himself and two compatriots by flying into a telegraph line outside of Manila. The pilot of the helicopter President Racuyal rode in did not crash his craft, however the president, eager as he was to land and jump from the craft to confront the ner-do-wells, was flung from the craft's open door during a brief bout of turbulence, and had to be bodily hauled back in by a quick thinking officer. Naturally, the president was rattled, but undeterred. The police, and Pascual's own compatriots, have, however, promised to continue his MO of lighting raids with limited violence, but only if the president himself no longer joins the raids. Reluctantly, President Racuyal accepted, but deep down he hopes to join the raids again someday. Maybe after his time in office is over, he'll become a police officer..."

###Leader Descriptions###
POLITICS_MANUEL_QUEZON_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 19 August, 1878, in Baler,  El Príncipe, Captaincy General of the Philippines\n§YPolitical Career: §!Quezon was born on 19 August 1878 in Baler in the district of El Príncipe then the capital of Nueva Ecija. In 1899, Quezon left his law studies at the University of Santo Tomas to join the Filipino war effort, and joined the Republican army during the Philippine–American War. He was an aide-de-camp to Emilio Aguinaldo. Quezon became a major, and fought in the Bataan sector. After surrendering in 1900, he returned to university and passed the bar examination in 1903. Quezon worked for a time as a clerk and surveyor, entering government service as treasurer for Mindoro and (later) Tayabas. He became a municipal councilor of Lucena, and was elected governor of Tayabas in 1906. Quezon was elected in 1907 to represent Tayabas's 1st district in the first Philippine Assembly under the Nacionalista Party ticket during the 1st Philippine Legislature, where he was majority floor leader and chairman of the committees on rules and appropriations. Quezon told the U.S. House of Representatives during a 1914 discussion of the Jones Bill that he received most of his primary education at the village school established by the Spanish government as part of the Philippines' free public-education system. Serving two terms from 1909 to 1916, he lobbied for the passage of the Philippine Autonomy Act. Quezon returned to Manila in 1916, and was elected senator from the Fifth Senatorial District. He was later elected Senate President and served continuously until 1935 (19 years). Quezon, along with Sergio Osmena, headed the first independent mission to the U.S. Congress in 1919, though, would face a split with his former ally Sergio Osmena over in 1921 following a financial crisis in 1921. This would result in Osmena’s and Quezon’s split. In 1935 Quezon was elected as the 1st President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in a landslide victory under the Nacionalista Party after a success in unifying the separated Nationalista with Osmena. Though Quezon is on edge, since Osmena and himself seem to be reaching a new impasse, potentially splitting the Nacionalista."
