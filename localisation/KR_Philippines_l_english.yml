PHI_totalist_party_long:0 "Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas\n§LPhilippine Communist Party§!\n§LPartido Comunista Filipino§!\n§gThe Philippine Communist Party would come from an ideological difference among the progressive forces that made up the Progressive Workers Party. At the time of its organization, disagreements had already risen on the necessity of peasant support for the revolution. Such differences would be exacerbated by the imprisonment of many of the leaders of the party after the 1931 Labor Day. When pardons were eventually accepted by the imprisoned leaders, a new party would be formed, led by peasant organizers and worker-intellectuals who had studied the works of Marx and their peasant associations and unions.§!"

With the trade union federation having ties to France, revolutionary syndicalist messaging, led by Crisanto Evangelista, soon gathered enough supporters to bring a radical reorganization plan to the union convention.

PHI_skadal_revolt_legacy_desc:0 "Founded as a peasant movement in the late 1920’s & early 1930s, the Sakdalista movement was a relatively popular movement during the insular government years. With independence in 1935, the group would support the National Socialist Party in the first national elections. With the loss of the 1935 election. On May 2nd 1935, with the alleged support from foreign actors like Japan, the Sakdalistas would attempt a revolt thinking that the rest of the nation would help their cause in creating an independent Philippines. But this would not be the case, as the movement would be crushed by the government forces, forcing its leader Beningo Ramos into exile. Despite crushing the movement, its rapid growth shows the strength of dissatisfaction among the population. Some sort of action must be taken, to prevent the growth of another movement that might grow using the same causes."

rd_phil.0.desc:0 "The Philippines were a Spanish colony until late 1898, when the United States claimed them as a war prize from Spain. Years of violent struggle for independence followed, and as the economic and political crisis in America began to worsen, they finally bore fruit. In 1934, The Tydings-McDuffie Act was passed, creating the Commonwealth of the Philippines with an elected government under Manuel Quezon and a constitution based upon that of the United States, while Washington retained control of the country's foreign affairs and military. More importantly, it stipulated that after ten years of transition, the archipelago would become a fully independent republic. But storm clouds are gathering over America. Will the Philippines achieve independence sooner than expected, and will that lead to them becoming prey for yet another major empire? Only time will tell..."

###Leader Descriptions###
POLITICS_MANUEL_QUEZON_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 19 August, 1878, in Baler,  El Príncipe, Captaincy General of the Philippines\n§YPolitical Career:§!Quezon was born on 19 August 1878 in Baler in the district of El Príncipe then the capital of Nueva Ecija. In 1899, Quezon left his law studies at the University of Santo Tomas to join the Filipino war effort, and joined the Republican army during the Philippine–American War. He was an aide-de-camp to Emilio Aguinaldo. Quezon became a major, and fought in the Bataan sector. After surrendering in 1900, he returned to university and passed the bar examination in 1903. Quezon worked for a time as a clerk and surveyor, entering government service as treasurer for Mindoro and (later) Tayabas. He became a municipal councilor of Lucena, and was elected governor of Tayabas in 1906. Quezon was elected in 1907 to represent Tayabas's 1st district in the first Philippine Assembly under the Nacionalista Party ticket during the 1st Philippine Legislature, where he was majority floor leader and chairman of the committees on rules and appropriations. Quezon told the U.S. House of Representatives during a 1914 discussion of the Jones Bill that he received most of his primary education at the village school established by the Spanish government as part of the Philippines' free public-education system.  Serving two terms from 1909 to 1916, he lobbied for the passage of the Philippine Autonomy Act. Quezon returned to Manila in 1916, and was elected senator from the Fifth Senatorial District. He was later elected Senate President and served continuously until 1935 (19 years). Quezon, along with Sergio Osmena, headed the first independent mission to the U.S. Congress in 1919,though, would face a split with his former ally Sergio Osmena over in 1921 following a financial crisis in 1921. This would result in Osmena’s split from Quezon’s party. In 1935 Quezon was elected as the 1st President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in a landslide victory under the Nacionalista Party after a success in unifying the separated Nationalista with Osmena. Though Quezon is on edge, since Osmena and himself seem to be reaching a new impasse, potentially splitting the Nacionalista."
