PHI_totalist_party_long:0 "Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas\n§LPhilippine Communist Party§!\n§LPartido Comunista Filipino§!\n§gThe Philippine Communist Party would come from an ideological difference among the progressive forces that made up the Progressive Workers Party. At the time of its organization, disagreements had already risen on the necessity of peasant support for the revolution. Such differences would be exacerbated by the imprisonment of many of the leaders of the party after the 1931 Labor Day. When pardons were eventually accepted by the imprisoned leaders, a new party would be formed, led by peasant organizers and worker-intellectuals who had studied the works of Marx and their peasant associations and unions.§!"

With the trade union federation having ties to France, revolutionary syndicalist messaging, led by Crisanto Evangelista, soon gathered enough supporters to bring a radical reorganization plan to the union convention.

PHI_skadal_revolt_legacy_desc:0 "Founded as a peasant movement in the late 1920’s & early 1930s, the Sakdalista movement was a relatively popular movement during the insular government years. With independence in 1935, the group would support the National Socialist Party in the first national elections. With the loss of the 1935 election. On May 2nd 1935, with the alleged support from foreign actors like Japan, the Sakdalistas would attempt a revolt thinking that the rest of the nation would help their cause in creating an independent Philippines. But this would not be the case, as the movement would be crushed by the government forces, forcing its leader Beningo Ramos into exile. Despite crushing the movement, its rapid growth shows the strength of dissatisfaction among the population. Some sort of action must be taken, to prevent the growth of another movement that might grow using the same causes."

Though this has led to signification profiteering from export production, yet the profits from these exports have not significantly changed the living conditions of the population meaning that even at the best of times, the living standard and consumption has been low within the country."

rd_phil.0.desc:0 "The Philippines were a Spanish colony until late 1898, when the United States claimed them as a war prize from Spain. Years of violent struggle for independence followed, and as the economic and political crisis in America began to worsen, they finally bore fruit. In 1934, The Tydings-McDuffie Act was passed, creating the Commonwealth of the Philippines with an elected government under Manuel Quezon and a constitution based upon that of the United States, while Washington retained control of the country's foreign affairs and military. More importantly, it stipulated that after ten years of transition, the archipelago would become a fully independent republic. But storm clouds are gathering over America. Will the Philippines achieve independence sooner than expected, and will that lead to them becoming prey for yet another major empire? Only time will tell..."
