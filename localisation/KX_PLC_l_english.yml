PLC_under_becks_eye:0 "Under Beck's Watchful Eye"
PLC_under_becks_eye_desc:0 "Jozef Beck, the self-proclaimed Saviour of the Commonwealth, has taken the reins of the infant Commonwealth. With plans as ambitious of Pilsudski's, Poland must be ready - and must not be lost. He has much to do as Marshal of the Commonwealth. Both Poland and Lithuania see Beck as a good man for the job, as a long-time associate of Pilsudski. But we all know he will lead Poland to glory!"

PLC_solidify_poland:0 "Solidify the Commonwealth"
PLC_solidify_poland_desc:0 "Beck only came into power because of the deteriorating situation in the Commonwealth, dispirited Lithuanians ready to break from the Crown aleady. Beck now must reel in these dissident Lithuanians, and convince them that a Commonwealth is a thing of beauty, a machine to fear, and a beast to fight."

PLC_guide_her_carefully:0 "Guide Her Carefully"
PLC_guide_her_carefully_desc:0 "Poland-Lithuania, in these trying times, must be handled with utmost care - a small slip could send our beautiful nation into a downwards spiral. We must learn to deal with our neighbors, the Germans and the Russians, who always want more of Poland. Poland is not yet lost!"

PLC_show_her_dark:0 "Show Her the Darkness"
PLC_show_her_dark_desc:0 "Our baby nation does not know what will happen after it dies. Beck knows. Horrible, horrible things will happen - a Fourth Partition. Any Pole's worst nightmare... and any Lithuanian's worst nightmare too. Poland must know why it is to fight, what to fight against!"

PLC_show_her_light:0 "Show Her the Light"
PLC_show_her_light_desc:0 "While death is a terrifying thing, we must see what life ahead will be. The Commonwealth of the Future will be grand - a land of peaceful coexistence and mutual cooperation. This is what Poland-Lithuania will fight for. The future, the people, the independence. Poland-Lithuania stands ready, and even against the biggest beast, will fight to the end."

PLC_show_her_the_destiny:0 "Her Destiny"
PLC_show_her_the_destiny_desc:0 "And yet Poland does not know what its destiny is. Beck knows this too - it is to be a vast great power, spanning from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, encompassing lands of Poles, Germans, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Ukrainians, and Romanians. The Intermarium it will be christened, and the Intermarium will never be partitioned."

PLC_rally_commonwealth_workers:0 "Rally the Workers of Poland-Lithuania"
PLC_rally_commonwealth_workers_desc:0 "Marsz, Marsz, Warszawo! The workers of Poland-Lithuania fight for a better tomorrow, and their wages will be sufficiently increased. The workers are the lifeblood of all nations, whether right or left - with no workers no work is done, thus no productivity. Poland-Lithuania's workers are prized possessions, and they shall know it."

PLC_night_in_vilnius:0 "A Night in Vilnius"
PLC_night_in_vilnius_desc:0 "A tour in Vilnius is to be taken - to interview the Lithuanians and ask them on matters of the Commonwealth. We'll scan for room to improve, while glorifying the future Commonwealth and promoting the ascension of the nation. The Lithuanians, if any are still wary of the Polish, will be bound once again, not just in arms, but in minds, too."

PLC_a_bound_military:0 "Poland and Lithuania, Brothers in Arms"
PLC_a_bound_military_desc:0 "Poland and Lithuania long coexisted under the predecessor Commonwealth. Yet again, we are united under a Commonwealth, and we will make no mistake on telling the people of the unification. The military is not Polish, nor is it Lithuanian. It is Polish-Lithuanian. There is no majority."

PLC_intermarium_dreams:0 "Follow Pilsudski's Footsteps"
PLC_intermarium_dreams_desc:0 "Jozef Pilsudski, Beck's higher-up, always advocated for concept between the seas. The Intermarium was to be a massive multicultural nation. Beck shall fulfill Pilsudski's wish, and show the world the fury of Poland and Lithuania's oppression and suppression."

PLC_enemy_in_the_west:0 "Enemy in the West"
PLC_enemy_in_the_west_desc:0 "The Germans are no friend of ours. They hold Polish land, Polish people, and much of Polish pride. To defeat Germany is equivalent to showing the world Poland's real strength, among taking revenge for the years of suffering."

PLC_one_sided_alliance:0 "A One-Sided Relationship"
PLC_one_sided_alliance_desc:0 "While we are allies with Germany - we must make it a secret that we are not their friend. Special operations and German technology will be used for Poland-Lithuania's interests, and not Germany's, whether they like it or not. Poland is independent, and it will prove that!"

PLC_enemy_in_the_east:0 "To Euthanize the Bear"
PLC_enemy_in_the_east_desc:0 "The Russians are another great enemy. An intricate design must be etched in order to defeat the Russians, even when the odds are against us. Catherine will cry in Hell, where she belongs. Russia will never rule Poland-Lithuania again. Never! And we'll ensure it, through sweat, toil, tears, and blood."

PLC_entente:0 "Diplomacy with the Exiles"
PLC_entente_desc:0 "Canada, like us, harbors territorial ambitions against nations far stronger than it. Mutual interests could draw us together, and aid in the final defeat of Germany. We'll perform diplomacy in both Warsaw and Ottawa. Poland-Lithuania will not stand alone, not again. And we know that the Canadians have no reason to betray us."

PLC_assert_diplomatic_independence:0 "Assert Polish-Lithuanian Foreign Policy"
PLC_assert_diplomatic_independence_desc:0 "All the world shall know Poland-Lithuania's ambitions. We are too small, too insignificant, for any of the great powers to even think about taking us seriously, but we are serious. Our armies will prove it on the battlefield. And no other nation shall dictate our policy; Poland-Lithuania is independent, and we have proof! We aren't lost!"

PLC_old_poland:0 "The Old Poland"
PLC_old_poland_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Poland that preceded the predecessor Commonwealth was of grand size. We look up to them - we shall bring Poland's extent back then to our time. The lands of old Poland are Polish property, and we will prove it if need be. But we shouldn't need to prove that, right?"

PLC_old_lithuania:0 "The Old Lithuania"
PLC_old_lithuania_desc:0 "The Grand Duchy of Lithuania that preceded the predecessor Commonwealth was of grand size. We look up to them - we shall bring Lithuania's extent back then to our time. The lands of old Lithuania are Lithuanian property, and we will prove it if need be. But we shouldn't need to prove that, right?"

PLC_southern_strike:0 "Dig Into Galicia"
PLC_southern_strike_desc:0 "Galicia used to be Polish. In our hearts, it still is. The strike southwards shall commence, and Poland-Lithuania will be in Lemberg with time, and in Vienna if God smiles upon us. And he does, for we know God sympathizes with the beaten."

PLC_heir_to_moldavia:0 "Undo Time's Work"
PLC_heir_to_moldavia_desc:0 "The old vassal state that was Moldavia will be refitted into Poland, with Romanian approval. We will gain this approval by the destruction of their armed forces. Romania will be on its knees when we enter Bucharest, and they will be at our whim. Fury stops none, and destiny stops even less."

PLC_westwards_reclamation:0 "Campaign to Berlin"
PLC_westwards_reclamation_desc:0 "Berlin is the heart of Polish-Lithuanian dread - where the Prussians came from to tell Poland-Lithuania it was to be cut down yet again. This time we will be the ones partitioning, and Germany will be at the mercy of Poland-Lithuania and Pilsudski's boot. They are but one of three, though..."

PLC_attack_WHR:0 "Divide White Ruthenia"
PLC_attack_WHR_desc:0 "White Ruthenia is both Polish and Lithuanian. The Commonwealth will dig into the Ruthenians, and bring them into the fold - and they will like it, for in the end their (new) country will be stronger both militarily and economically than White Ruthenia ever was."

PLC_into_russia:0 "Shoot the Poison Dart"
PLC_into_russia_desc:0 "The blowdart is ready to be pricked into Russia. All we must do is blow, and the Russians will become sleepy, and fall to our feet - and we will tenderly care for the new Russians, as some may want to return to "their" Russia, but we know better than they. Diplomacy is needed to convince such terrible schools of thought otherwise."

PLC_knocking_north:0 "Come Knocking Northwards"
PLC_knocking_north_desc:0 "Knock knock, Latvia & Estonia! It's the Commonwealth, ready to integrate you! It will not hurt - rather, it shall feel good, knowing that you are in a prosperous and powerful nation, a rising star on the world stage. Be proud, for Poland-Lithuania will cherish you too!"

PLC_ukrainian_debut:0 "A Match in Ukraine"
PLC_ukrainian_debut_desc:0 "Finally, we shall take some coast into the Black Sea. It will be a fight, sure, but the art of propaganda and furthermore the arts of war and peace will tell Ukraine that integration is their best choice. By assimilating Ukraine, we can only expect good, for our masterful government will tell all of the good Commonwealth and the evil enemies abroad, and Poland-Lithuania's desire to see greatness."

kxplc.2.t:0 "Canada Denies"
kxplc.2.d:0 "The Canadian Government has shot down our diplomatic approaches by stating that they are not considering letting us into the Entente. A foolish decision; they will never beat Germany, then.\nMeanwhile, this will make it harder for us to gain all that we desire. There are no other opportunities, if there were, we would have taken them. It seems that Poland-Lithuania will fight alone, but nevertheless we will come out on top."
kxplc.2.a:0 "Foolish indeed."

kxplc.3.t:0 "Poland-Lithuania wishes to join the Entente"
kxplc.3.d:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian government has shot a request towards us, telling us of their intention and wish to join our alliance. It's always nice to have new allies, right? This will also give us more of a power base in Eastern Europe."
kxplc.3.a:0 "Of course!"
kxplc.3.b:0 "Not now."

kxplc.4.t:0 "Jozef Beck Promises to Follow Pilsudski"
kxplc.4.d:0 "Jozef Beck, close associate and friend of the late Jozef Pilsudski, has promised to uphold Pilsudski's dream of an Intermarium. A strange aspiration, but Beck has started lobbying support for a multicultural Intermarium, that stretches from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Pilsudski surely smiles upon his soul, but will we ever see it realized?"
kxplc.4.a:0 "Curious."

kxplc.5.t:0 "Jozef Beck applauds the Commonwealth"
kxplc.5.d:0 "The creation of the Polish-Lithuanian is noted by Jozef Beck as a "great first step towards the Miedzymorze." While we weren't even trying for such a creation, his support is appreciated, and as a rising figure in Polish-Lithuanian politics, will have some effect on our populace. The immediate effect, though, is a little more power to the political machine."
kxplc.5.a:0 "Interesting."

kxplc.6.t:0 "Forewarning from Jozef Beck"
kxplc.6.d:0 "Jozef Beck, influential Polish politician, has warned  the government that our increasing pro-Polish policies and actions will result in a collapse of the Commonwealth if we do not reverse of change our course of action. The Lithuanian side of politics agree with his statements, as do some of the Polish, and many are requesting some reform to prevent a Lithuanian secession."
kxplc.6.a:0 "He may be right."

kxplc.8.t:0 "Jozef Beck starts campaigning against the government"
kxplc.8.d:0 "It seems that the government supporter and ally Jozef Beck has abandoned his supporting stance towards the Commonwealth, and has turned tail and started mobilizing his supporters against us. He says that we have failed in our duty to protect Poland-Lithuania and that [ROOT.GetLeader] and his cabinet will not die with the Commonwealth alive. Beck asserts that he would be a better ruler, nevermind the validity of that statement. He's certainly causing a ruckus amongst the populace, though."
kxplc.8.a:0 "Worrisome."
kxplc.8.b:0 "Arrest him."

kxplc.10.d:0 "Things have come to a head today, with Jozef Beck and armed, experienced military supporters have marched on the Palace housing the Head of State, and to much rioting and scuffling, have entered open conflict with the loyal police units. It seems that a coup is in progress... and after a couple tumultuous hours, the dust settles, and..."
kxplc.10.a:0 "Beck routs the garrison and declares himself the Marshal!"
kxplc.10.b:0 "Beck's soldiers are halted and beaten!"

kxplc.11.t:0 "A Night in Vilnius"
kxplc.11.d:0 "Beck and the government have taken a trip to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, to view and admire it. And that they did - to much staring by the citizenry. Vilnius's headlines in the morning were all about Beck's journey through Vilnius and his positive comments about it, praising Lithuanian culture and expressing interest in it. Obviously, this visit will garner him untold amounts of support from the Lithuanian people of Poland-Lithuania."
kxplc.11.a:0 "Delightful."

kxplc.12.t:0 "A Dinner with the Government"
kxplc.12.d:0 "A formal dinner was arranged for tonight, with not just Beck, but with him, the entire government, and their wives. The great dinner was marked by lavish food, exquisite food, and curious food, from all things Eastern Europe. It was quite the success - while costing lots of money to arrange and play out, the experience was enjoyed by all participants."
kxplc.12.a:0 "Delicious."

kxplc.13.t:0 "Ignacy Moscicki and Defense"
kxplc.13.d:0 "Ignacy Moscicki, Minister of Defence of the Commonwealth, has suggested an expensive plan to emplace anti-air fortifications all around the nation, from remote forests to dense cities. The anti-air would protect us from future air raids in any war we may fight later on. Some people support it, due to the prospect of extra defense, while others do not due to the cost of doing such a thing. And Beck has the final say - what does he say to this proposal?"
kxplc.13.a:0 "Good proposal!"
kxplc.13.b:0 "No need to spend more money."

kxplc.14.t:0 "Polish-Lithuanian Propaganda"
kxplc.14.d:0 "Propaganda artists hired by the state have attained us plentiful amounts of support for incoming wars that we do or do not start. The artists have received favorable masses of cash for their efforts in helping the state. Meanwhile, on the public side, people rally for Beck and his government, with support far and wide all over the Commonwealth."
kxplc.14.a:0 "Onwards!"

kxplc.15.t:0 "PPS rallies workers"
kxplc.15.d:0 "The Polish Socialist Party, with support for Beck, has told of their support to the country, and rallied Polish and Lithuanian workers alike to the cause of the Intermarium. It was a strange move, according to many, but a welcome one. The support for war is up even more, arguably an all time high for Poland and furthermore a high score for the Commonwealth. Our justified wars will bring Poland to stardom!"
kxplc.15.a:0 "Rise, for the Commonwealth!"

kxplc.16.t:0 "The Haunting of the Palace"
kxplc.16.d:0 "Beck himself has felt suddenly cold at times, and many attribute it to the wandering spirit of Jozef Pilsudski. It seems his spirit is restless, but it has caused no damage or paranormal experiences yet, if it even exists. Beck wonders if the spirit of Pilsudski will be put to rest once the concept between the seas is realized. Which, obviously, in time, will be."
kxplc.16.a:0 "Pilsudski's ghost will be at rest soon."

kxplc.17.t:0 "Polish Military Itching to Fight"
kxplc.17.d:0 "The enthused soldiers of the Commonwealth have been chattering like birds day and night, wondering when they will get to test their mettle on the battlefield. Generals and other military officials tell them soon, but give vague answers on how soon "soon" is. Military exercise, however, is showing quicker benefit than usual."
kxplc.17.a:0 "Soon."

kxplc.18.t:0 "The Between the Seas Concept"
kxplc.18.d:0 "Jozef Pilsudski had a dream, a dream of a multicultural nation from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. It was to be formed upon Germany's defeat in the Weltkrieg, but as everyone knows, Germany did not lose the Weltkrieg. Now, though, the idea is revived by Jozef Beck, and will not be hampered by Germany's loss in war."
kxplc.18.a:0 "We'll do it, Pilsudski."

kxplc.19.t:0 "Lithuanians Cheer for Beck"
kxplc.19.d:0 "A tour around Lithuania was met with cheers and whoops for Beck by the Lithuanian inhabitants. The Lithuanian members of government said they supported him, but here's concrete proof! Beck was very pleased by the experience and was showing off to the Lithuanians just how good of a leader he was, and that he only had more planned."
kxplc.19.a:0 "Great news."

kxplc.20.t:0 "Memories of the Partitions"
kxplc.20.d:0 "The three Partitions of Poland were a nightmare to Poles and Lithuanians alike, with their statehood stripped away by foreign powers who understood nothing about them. The memory of the partition is still a sore in this new Commonwealth, but with Beck's wildly popular government, the wounds are beginning to heal, and as long as Poland and Lithuania are not lost, the statehood of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth will only be strengthened and healed further."
kxplc.20.a:0 "Poland-Lithuania is not yet lost!"

kxplc.21.t:0 "Meals Localized"
kxplc.21.d:0 "Top chefs of the Intermarium have made the decision that in order to get the freshest meat and plants possible, importation of foreign livestock and greens will be minimized and instead replaced with farms directly housed inside the Intermarium. Strangely, a lot of this livestock comes from the north, in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, where a prominent farming oligarch under the name Heinrich Himmler has monopolized meat production. While some disagree with Himmler's morality in slaughtering, they all can concede that the meat Himmler and his associates produce is the best in all of the Intermarium. Himmler's meat production is now directly going to the dinners of lavish parties of Beck and the government, which is sure to only give him more of a boost. We'll just have to keep an eye on him, lest he get a little too ambitious...\n\nOn the green side, farms have seen a decrease in inedible plant growth and an increase in herb, vegetable, and spice growth. The increase has seen an influx of cookbooks and numerous other culinary items into the households of the Intermarium.\nSurprisingly to the chefs, the decision was popular among the government and even the lower populace to an extent.\nOf course, we'll still be importing food, but not at the level we were before.\nMaybe we'll earn some prestigious chefs sometime, too?"
kxplc.21.a:0 "I wonder if Himmler will try to go green as well?"

kxplc.22.t:0 "The Intermarium Offers Membership"
kxplc.22.d:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian led Intermarium has offered our nation membership in the Intermarium, telling us that we will be represented just as well as the Poles, the Lithuanians, the Romanians, the Ukrainians, Latvians, and Estonians - all of them. A perfectly equal union, they say. We'll give up our independence, but will it be for a better cause?"
kxplc.22.a:0 "We'll join, sure!"
kxplc.22.b:0 "Never in a million years!"

kxplc.23.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Denies!"
kxplc.23.d:0 "[From.GetName] reportedly has no intention to join the Intermarium, however foolish such a thing is. Now the time comes to make a choice regarding this unfortunate news: do we simply move in to annex them anyway, or leave them be, and maybe even try and build up relations?"
kxplc.23.a:0 "Too bad."
kxplc.23.b:0 "Let it rest..."
