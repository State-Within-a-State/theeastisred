POLITICS_BOKASSA_EMPEROR_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa. Born in 1921, the young Askari Jean-Bédel Bokassa took the destiny of Ubangi-Shari in his hands, leading a fanatical group of veterans and recruits against the dying German colonial machine. With his victory earned and the people of Bangui at his back, the young Bokassa has taken the reins of this former colony and has begun to forge it into a mighty empire - the first of its kind in post-Collapse Africa. Though he has already begun to receive criticisms for his peculiar appetites and violent tendencies, the people still adore their savior and hero in Bokassa. Taking the full title of ‘His Imperial Majesty Bokassa the First, Apostle of Peace and Servant of Jesus Christ, Emperor and Marshal of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people, united within the national political party, the MESAN’, this young soldier-turned-rebel-turned-emperor shall lead the lands of Ubangi-Shari and beyond into a new dawn as the rightful Emperor of Central Africa."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_LEADER_DESC:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, though young and inexperienced in any form of statecraft or leadership, has defied the odds and helped lead his people to independence. Though only born in 1921 and taking up the honored role of an Askari auxiliary just a few short years ago, Bokassa has proven his tenacity and cunning, if also sadism, in his brutal war against the German colonizers. With their colonial monstrosity of Mittelafrika burning, Bokassa has begun to be seen as a new unifying figure and national father to the dispersed and disparate peoples of Ubangi-Shari, and as he endeavors to bring stability to this war-torn land, he shall create a newly independent state of which the people of Africa have never seen."

### Ideas ###
CEA_split_larp:0 "Who to Idolize?"
CEA_split_larp_desc:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, our national father and savior, has been torn between two competing influences. Long fascinated with monarchism and with strong imperial figures, the young Bokassa has fervently modeled his practices on both Napoleon Bonaparte, first French emperor, and Frederick the Great, the most honored Prussian king. Divided between these two identities, the young ‘Emperor’ must soon pick a path to follow and a titan to emulate, lest his regime drift aimlessly without direction."

CEA_inferiority_complex:0 "Desire for Greatness"
CEA_inferiority_complex_desc:0 "Despite his young age and inexperience when it comes to ruling a nation, Bokassa has nevertheless come to control all of Central Africa. From his base of power in Ubangi, this young Emperor now requires an empire to rule over. This greatness shall not be denied to him, and he is willing to cut through anyone and anything to earn his prize."

CEA_emperor_without_empire:0 "An Emperor with No Empire"
CEA_emperor_without_empire_desc:0 "With our borders secured and the foundations of the Bokassa regime now cemented, the young Emperor has begun to look outward for new worlds to conquer. Eyeing up the Kamerunians to the West, who have long been embroiled in a never-ending stalemate, Bokassa believes he has found a perfect target to serve as the site for our first imperial expansion."

CEA_fresh_meat:0 "Fresh Meat"
CEA_fresh_meat_desc:0 "While many in the remains of Mittelafrika face the looming possibility of starvation and famine, the people of [CEA.GetNameDef] have to deal with no such fears. Our proud leader, Jean-Bedel Bokassa has secured a large supply of fresh and hearty; albeit strange tasting meat to feed our populace. The source of this protein is still a mystery, but with a fed populace and a nourished army, the question of this meat’s origin is of little importance.\n After all, what you don’t know can’t hurt you... right?"

#bet you didnt think Central Africa had events eh?
### events ###
cea.1.t:0 "An Empire of Ubangi-Shari?"
cea.1.d:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, former Askari conscript of Bangui turned impromptu officer and rebellion leader, has completely seized control of the city following the collapse of the chain of command in the wake of Mittelafrika’s demise. He and his native Askari loyalists have the support of the native African population at his side, for long has this colony chafed under the rule of the Germans and French before them. Under this young revoltee, the lands of Ubangi-Shari have been freed from the clutches of vile imperialists and colonizers, and now Bokassa seeks to advance his own ambitions. \n\nLong has this charismatic, inexperienced soldier dreamed of an empire of his own as he grew up in the shadow of the Kaiser, and now with the region’s capital in his hands and the will of the people behind him, Bokassa can do just that."
cea.1.a:0 "A new empire rises as another collapses and decays."

cea.2.t:0 "A Palace Fit For an Emperor"
cea.2.d:0 "If we are to legitimize our rule as Emperor of Central Africa, we surely need a palace worthy of such a title. In the ruins of the old German fort that once lorded over the city of Bangui, a new complex shall be constructed for our new Emperor. Decorated in the finest and most lavish decor and finery we can get our hands on and constructed in a similar style to the great palaces and mansions of the Ottomans, Egyptians, and Europeans, this new construction shall serve as the center of Bokassa’s regime and as his new favorite place in the nation. From atop its towers or within its pelt-lined and marble-walled sanctums, the honorable Bokassa I shall rule over all of Ubangi-Shari and all who reside within it."
cea.2.a:0 "An estate to rival the Kaiser’s!"

cea.3.t:0 "The Birth of a Dynasty"
cea.3.d:0 "As Bokassa sat in the exquisite and opulent study of his new palace, smoking a cigar and enjoying the sunlight filtering in from the massive stained-glass window of himself, one of his meek and quivering advisors entered his chambers to discuss an urgent matter. \n\n‘My lord, surely, as a newly crowned Emperor, many matters and responsibilities demand your attention. However, we must make sure that we do not fall into a dynastic crisis when you eventually pass on…’, the advisor trailed off, not wanting to anger His Majesty. ‘Thus, the idea of establishing a formal harem of local women for you, sire, has been brought up in many meetings’ he began again, shaking as the nerves of talking to his flippant Emperor rocked him to his core, ‘and as such I felt it prudent to deliver the suggestion to you. They would surely be honoured to meet you.’ \n\nBokassa had sat, quietly and unmoving, at this sudden interruption, but could not help but to be delighted by the end of the trembling servant’s advisal. Though he wanted to execute this fool upon his entry, his soothing and wise words have allowed cooler heads to prevail. ‘Make it so’, the Emperor decreed before going back to his lounging.. As the servant left to make the arrangements for his Emperor’s new haram, Bokassa leaned back in his chair once more, took a drag from his cigar, and thought to himself..."
cea.3.a:0 "’...It's good to be the Emperor.’"

cea.4.t:0 "Egypt's Helping Hand"
cea.4.d:0 "My Emperor, we have to ensure that our efforts to cement your rule are not in vain. Thus, we must seek a treaty with the Kingdom of Egypt, our powerful neighbours who have greatly helped us so far. By sending a delegation to their capital, we shall formally reach out an olive branch to this fair kingdom - the only other honorable and sovereign monarchy in Africa besides our own. Together, false kings such as the Selassies and the Sultan shall fall to our swords and your splendor."
cea.4.a:0 "Make it so!"

cea.5.t:0 "The Emperor of Chari Proposes a Treaty"
cea.5.d:0 "Shortly after German control broke down over Africa, a Central African Askari officer by the name of Jean-Bédel Bokassa had proclaimed himself Emperor of Ubangi-Shari and all of Central Africa. With no small amount of support from locals and his men alike, who wished public order to be maintained first and foremost, this ‘Bokassa I’ has become infamous throughout the region for his antics and eccentricities. However, this madman still has established a somewhat-stable dominion of his lands, and now he proposes to join our alliance. Such a deal would greatly strengthen our Sub-Saharan position, and allow us to further increase our influence in the former German colonies."
cea.5.a:0 "Reach out to this ‘Emperor’ and accept his deal."
cea.5.b:0 "Why would we need a treaty with a jumped up mutineer?"

cea.6.t:0 "The Kamerun Conflict Bleeds into our Borders"
cea.6.d:0 "As if the collapse of Mittelafrika hadn’t triggered enough bloodshed, the once great colonial state of Kamerun has collapsed into anarchy and civil war. On one hand, socialists and weaker democratic elements fight ferociously with tooth and nail for their shot at freedom and self-determination, while on the other hand, the last vestiges of the Kaiser’s colonial rule in the area hold on with their dying gasp, desperately clinging to the failing idea of German imperialism. With our foundations secured, we must choose a side to support in this conflict -  a difficult choice to pick the lesser of two evils. \n\nSiding with the Socialists would greatly increase their chances of winning, relieving us of another colonialist holdout, yet strengthening the vile hold of Socialism in Africa. Alternatively, siding with Germany seems insane after just freeing ourselves from their yoke, but many within our regime closely hold dear the sentiment that it is ‘better to be dead than Red.’ The final choice is, of course, up to our young leader Bokassa, but a choice must be made soon while the fires of war are still fresh."
cea.6.a:0 "Though we despise their ideology, the Socialists are Kamerun’s best hope at freedom."
cea.6.b:0 "The Germans, though our old vile oppressors, are preferable to the Reds."
