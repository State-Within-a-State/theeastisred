INC_entrench_the_party_constitution:0 "Entrench The Party Constitution"
INC_entrench_the_party_constitution_desc:0 "Marxism-Leninism was founded by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and V. Lenin on the inheritance of selective scientific achievements, human ideological values and culture. Their ideology is a system of scientific views and methodologies based on the study of human history and capitalist economy. Its goals are to liberate people and societies and to bring about a life of prosperity, freedom and happiness for all as well. Marxism's transcendent ideological values are not only the theory of the proletarian revolution but also the dialectical and historical materialist methodologies. It depicts the method of examining phenomena’s developments (including history and societies) in the struggle between the two opposites as well as the interaction between infrastructure and superstructure. These relationships depend on both objective norms and human subjective activities. Grounded on the Marxism-Engelsism ideology, Lenin comprehensively developed the revolutionary theory in the imperialism, deepened the argument on the revolution of national liberation and Socialist construction skipping capitalism. Lenin confirmed that the oppressed could possibly carry out revolution of national liberation from the imperialist domination... and "to defeat capitalism..., it requires the alliance and unification of the proletariat and the oppressed all over the world."\nThe relationship between Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought is dialectical. Historically, Marxism-Leninism was introduced to our People by Nguyen Ai Quoc - President Ho Chi Minh. This was written in "The way that led me to Leninism" - "At that time...I admired Lenin because he was a great patriot who had liberated his countrymen... Gradually, I understood that only socialism and communism could free the oppressed people and laborers from slavery." He also referred to "Marxism-Leninism as a miracle handbook", which provided the solutions for people to ride out the storm. In terms of political ideology, the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought is dialectical in both theory and methodology. He emphasized that "studying theory is not aimed at turning you into doctrinaire conservatives but putting the Marxist-Leninist methodology to good use in our revolutionary practice.”"

Cadres and party members, “if loyal and honest, always give the first priority to the common benefits of the Party, the revolution and the people. Revolution morality is also “the determination to civilize and liberate human race from being oppressed and exploited”. Ho Chi Minh affirmed that “Nothing is more glorious than the improvement of revolutionary morality to make significant contribution to the cause of building socialism and liberating humankind”. Revolutionary morality in Ho Chi Minh’s thought is to work for the common benefits of the Party, the nation and the human race, not for individual fame or partial benefits. It is the root and the source of invincible power of revolutionaries, being the foundation for cadres and party members to fulfil their mission."

Such qualities are the courage, perseverance, and absolute loyalty to the revolutionary goals and ideals; diligence, frugality, integrity, uprightness, public-spiritedness and selflessness; closeness to, faith in and love for the people, and the willingness to learn from and forge a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses; and whole-hearted dedication to the Fatherland and the people.

His ideology on three-component armed forces was developed and became our Party’s unique, creative model of military organisation, suitable to Indochina’s military art, thus effectively tapping on all-people strength in the fight against the enemy; combining guerilla warfare with regular warfare, operational activities of regular army corps with uprisings of the masses; creatively and flexibly applying operational methods to annihilate the enemy at anytime, anywhere, and by any weapons."

INC_entrench_the_party_constitution_desc:0 "Marxism-Leninism was founded by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and V. Lenin on the inheritance of selective scientific achievements, human ideological values and culture. Their ideology is a system of scientific views and methodologies based on the study of human history and capitalist economy. Its goals are to liberate people and societies and to bring about a life of prosperity, freedom and happiness for all as well. Marxism's transcendent ideological values are not only the theory of the proletarian revolution but also the dialectical and historical materialist methodologies. It depicts the method of examining phenomena’s developments (including history and societies) in the struggle between the two opposites as well as the interaction between infrastructure and superstructure. These relationships depend on both objective norms and human subjective activities. Grounded on the Marxism-Engelsism ideology, Lenin comprehensively developed the revolutionary theory in the imperialism, deepened the argument on the revolution of national liberation and Socialist construction skipping capitalism. Lenin confirmed that the oppressed could possibly carry out revolution of national liberation from the imperialist domination... and "to defeat capitalism..., it requires the alliance and unification of the proletariat and the oppressed all over the world."
\nThe relationship between Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought is dialectical. Historically, Marxism-Leninism was introduced to our People by Nguyen Ai Quoc - President Ho Chi Minh. This was written in "The way that led me to Leninism" - "At that time...I admired Lenin because he was a great patriot who had liberated his countrymen... Gradually, I understood that only socialism and communism could free the oppressed people and laborers from slavery." He also referred to "Marxism-Leninism as a miracle handbook", which provided the solutions for people to ride out the storm. In terms of political ideology, the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought is dialectical in both theory and methodology. He emphasized that "studying theory is not aimed at turning you into doctrinaire conservatives but putting the Marxist-Leninist methodology to good use in our revolutionary practice.”"

Cadres and party members, “if loyal and honest, always give the first priority to the common benefits of the Party, the revolution and the people. Revolution morality is also “the determination to civilize and liberate human race from being oppressed and exploited”. Ho Chi Minh affirmed that “Nothing is more glorious than the improvement of revolutionary morality to make significant contribution to the cause of building socialism and liberating humankind”. Revolutionary morality in Ho Chi Minh’s thought is to work for the common benefits of the Party, the nation and the human race, not for individual fame or partial benefits. It is the root and the source of invincible power of revolutionaries, being the foundation for cadres and party members to fulfil their mission."

His ideology on three-component armed forces was developed and became our Party’s unique, creative model of military organisation, suitable to Indochina’s military art, thus effectively tapping on all-people strength in the fight against the enemy; combining guerilla warfare with regular warfare, operational activities of regular army corps with uprisings of the masses; creatively and flexibly applying operational methods to annihilate the enemy at anytime, anywhere, and by any weapons."
