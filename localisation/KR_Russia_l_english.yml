russia.1.d:0 "After the October Revolution Anti-Bolshevik forces started to consolidate across the former Russian Empire, leading to a massive rebellion against the Soviet Republic in Siberia, and the Don and Kuban steppes during the middle of 1918. The White movement made considerable gains, but could not defeat the well placed Red Army, which still dominated the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. The war changed when the German Empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, intervened on behalf of the Whites in exchange for recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By January 1920, both Moscow and Petrograd had fallen to the White forces. The majority of White leaders decided to hold the Constituent Assembly, and, as a result, a new Russian Republic was established in the former Imperial capital. For the past fifteen years the leading political parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under president Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. Today Russia is becoming increasingly unstable, and other political forces are growing. They consider that it is now time for change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."

russia.1017.t:0 "A Troubled History: First Years"
russia.1017.d:0 "In 1920, a Constituent Assembly was held, the elections to which, as in 1918, were won by the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. In the absence of the Bolsheviks in the elections, the liberal party of the Kadets and the social democratic party of the Mensheviks, respectively, took second and third places by some margin.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly, elected in this way, decided that Russia is a democratic federal parliamentary republic, with universal suffrage. The Parliament consisted of two chambers: the State Council and the Duma. The State Council, renamed the Senate in 1925, became a bastion of reactionary conservative forces in the young republic, as it was formed in a somewhat authoritarian way.\n\nIn 1920, according to the Constitution, the Senate elected the first president of Russia - Alexander Kerensky. He became a compromise candidate, had no special power, but symbolized the unity between the Socialist-Cadet parliament and the conservative Senate. The real disaster was the first term of Kerensky's government and the Fifth State Duma. After the civil war, the country faced an economy in ruins, peasant uprisings, and famine, mostly caused by the Bolshevik's 'Black Redistribution'. In the course of the "black redistribution", a few of the most efficient estates were destroyed, in which landowners or rich merchants farmed according to advanced European methods, and the yield in such estates could exceed the yield on peasant lands by up to 50 %. Kerensky never solved the land issue completely, canceling the 'Black Redistribution' and returning lands in the urban areas to the landlords. The famine that seized the Volga region and the southern regions led to a decrease in the population and an increase in discontent. This was also facilitated by the Japanese occupation of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk.\n\nIn 1922, just two years after the ratification of the Minsk Treaty, there was an uprising in Karelia. Thanks to German mediation, the East Karelian national revolt was quelled with the signing of the Treaty of Tartu, which awarded the Parishes of Repola and Porajärvi to the Kingdom of Finland, but prevented a full-scale war and kept East Karelia under Russian rule. Thanks to Kerensky's diplomatic efforts, Russia managed to establish good relations with most of the new countries that emerged from the Civil War."

russia.1018.t:0 "A Troubled History: Consolidating Power"
russia.1018.d:0 "In the following years, the Government managed to get rid of many of the consequences of the Civil War. The economic crisis was coming to an end, and the industry began to develop slowly. This was largely determined by its vulnerable position in the face of German domination. German business was introduced into the territory of Russia, displacing domestic production and putting Russia in a position dependent on the Empire. Flirting with the German Empire destroyed Kerensky's image as an independent compromise candidate. Russian industry was developing belatedly, and the loss of Western territories rich in human and industrial resources further slowed this process. In addition, the democratisation of the regime threatened the conservative strata of society, including the Cossacks, wealthy businessmen and aristocrats.\n\nDiscontent with the Kerensky regime and anti-German sentiment grew and reached a climax in the final months of 1924, in the event, known as the Kolchak Putsch."

russia.1019.t:0 "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.1"
russia.1019.d:0 "The various Cossack Hosts likewise grew increasingly wary of the government in Petrograd, fearing that a SR majority would strip them of their traditional rights and privileges on behalf of their territories' vast, non-Cossack populations.\nDespite the Putsch's eventual moniker, Alexander Kolchak was a late addition to the conspiracy, as he had been largely content to sit on his laurels in the aftermath of the Civil War. He was, however, the natural figurehead for an anti-German, anti-Kerenskyist coup, as he had already proven himself as a Russian Cincinnatus, who had made hard choices in war-time before relinquishing them in peace. Feeling assured that the Russian military would overwhelmingly side with him over Kerensky, Kolchak signed-on enthusiastically with the plotters.\n\nThe Cossacks, despite their key role in the coming uprising, had diverse and often unclear motivations. Ataman Pyotr Krasnov, despite a well-known reputation for his cooperation with the Germans during the Civil War, signed on with his Kuban counterpart, Nikolay Bukretov, out of shared concerns for the safety of Cossack privileges, as well as continuing resentment over their treatment by fellow White generals in the past. Much the same could be said of Ataman Dutov of the Orenburg Cossacks and Ataman Semyonov of the Transbaikal Cossacks, who valued their past service with Kolchak, and shared concerns over the Russian government's rapprochement with the Central Asian Turkic peoples and Buryats over the Cossacks' concerns.\n\nThe Czechoslovak Legion was the final part of the puzzle, and its concerns were driven overwhelmingly by hatred for the Central Powers, who continued to occupy their homelands, and while some Legionnaires had returned clandestinely over the years, the majority remained in exile in Russia, at the threat of facing trial as traitors back home."

russia.1020.t:0 "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.2"
russia.1020.d:0 "The date for the Putsch was set for November 14th, 1924, and it began without issues. Kolchak-aligned Russian and Czechoslovak soldiers surrounded the Winter Palace and other key locations of Petrograd, and telegraph offices were seized to announce the immediate arrest of Kerensky on charges of treasonous profiteering and corruption from deals made with the Germans. Meanwhile, the Cossack forces of Atamans Krasnov and Dutov deployed across Southern Russia and Central Asia, chiefly as a show of force to inspire confidence among the rest of the Russian military.\n\nThe response, however, shocked Kolchak and his backers. Rather than rally to his side, the overwhelming majority of Russian enlisted soldiers and even officers refused to join the putsch, and while they refused to open fire on the putschists, no help was extended from that corner. Kolchak immediately laid the blame for this on the shoulders of General Lavr Kornilov, who, despite himself having launched a coup against Kerensky in 1917, refused to help Kolchak out of lingering resentment for not being chosen as White commander-in-chief during the Civil War. More plausibly, Kornilov and the rest of Russia's military high command likely realized that antagonizing the Germans while Russia was in such a weak state would simply make the situation worse, and that Kerensky was a necessary evil to moderate the demands of the still-strong Socialist presence in the country.\n\nRegardless of their motivations, Russia's military largely stood by and watched as the Putschists tried to seize power. Though Kerensky would claim credit for it in later years, it is unlikely any of his statements from the besieged Winter Palace had made it out to the wider world before mass demonstrations paralyzed Russia's cities. Countrywide strikes were called, and those Putschists outside the major cities found themselves stranded as railroad workers sabotaged their attempts to move. The Putsch in Petrograd would last less than 48 hours, as loyalist military units and public protest convinced Kolchak's supporters to lay down their arms peacefully in exchange for amnesty."

russia.1021.t:0 "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.3"
russia.1021.d:0 "Within two weeks, the Cossacks had also all agreed to stand down, albeit with great trepidation for the future. Ataman Dutov was too well ensconced in Central Asia and too beloved by his men to be peacefully removed, and so he was left alone. Much the same could be said of Krasnov and his supporters in the south, who rallied the threat of radical Cossack independence to forestall rash action by the Russian government. Nevertheless, it was likely the German government's own guarantee of a peaceful resolution in southern Russia which saved Krasnov's and Bukretov's regime and establishing a secured border at the Don and Volga rivers, as Mitteleuropa had much to gain with the lingering threat of a Cossack quasi-states.\n\nAs for Kolchak himself, the Admiral and his closest supporters fled east to the Japanese-backed Transamur, the last bastion of "Entente" controlled Russia, wherein he would lay claim to the title of legitimate ruler of Russia. Backed by the Transbaikal Cossack and Eastern Siberian Federalists, the borders were move as far as the Baikal lake and Irkutsk.\n\nKerensky had no choice but to accept what had happened as a fact. The newly formed states were protected by the German and Japanese imperialists, and the country was not ready for a full-fledged war, not yet recovered from the horrors of civil war and with poorly developed industry. Of course, relations with Germany and Japan were damaged, but Russia was still forced to comply with the terms of the Minsk Treaty. Instead of war, Kerensky chose peace, but he also realized the weakness of his power, so it was the following years that shaped Russian reality as it is now."

russia.1022.t:0 "A Troubled History: New Rules"
russia.1022.d:0 "Kerensky's second term was marred not only by the Kolchak campaign, but also by the rise of radicalism in society and the creation of new parties and organizations that demanded radical changes. The bloc 'New Bolsheviks', created by Rykov and Bukharin, took shape as a political party - the NSP and began to promote its ideas of a gradual transition to socialism. And after the Kolchak coup and the loss of the Kuban and Eastern Siberia in the wake of anti-German sentiment, Boris Savinkov, relying on the peasant electorate, creates a huge bloc of right-wing parties - the People's Republican Party of Russia.\n\nAlready in 1925 Kerensky's reaction followed. He began his transformation and strengthening of his own power. The State Council was renamed the Senate, and the procedure for election to it was changed. It became an institution composed of 150 senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations, 50 of whom are appointed by the regional legislatures, 50 - by the president and 50 - elected by the people with sufficient age (30 years) and higher education or social status (former aristocracy) or personal wealth.\n\nBy becoming a stronghold of conservative forces, the Senate guaranteed the blocking of any radical Duma bills aimed at changing the status quo, and at the same time guaranteed the irremovability of Kerensky's power. Kerensky consolidated his power, but a sharp shift toward authoritarianism increased resistance to his rule in the Duma. The leader of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, Chernov, agreed to maintain the coalition only for the sake of stabilizing the situation, hoping for free elections and that sooner or later the Socialist-Revolutionaries would be able to implement their policies."

russia.1023.t:0 "A Troubled History: Stabilisation and Decay"
russia.1023.d:0 "After the upheavals of the Kolchak putsch and the radicalization of society, however, the situation has somewhat stabilized - both in the village and in the city. Yields increased, German technology brought mechanization and new fertilizers, and large cities began to develop industry. In 1927, the Social Revolutionaries won the elections again and re-formed a government with the Kadets, and in 1928 Kerensky was again re-elected president. The status quo persisted.\n\nThis idyll and hopes for further stability were overshadowed by several factors. The first of these was the unfinished land reform, which continued to sow unrest among the peasants. The second is economic dependence on Germany due to the Minsk Agreement and high tariffs. The third is the authoritarian bias of Kerensky, who had to make more and more concessions to the Senate.\n\nWith the hope of reducing dependence on German capital, the conservatives suggested that Kerensky should begin a policy of protectionism aimed at developing domestic production. The state reduced trade with Germany, which in the short term led to a rapid growth of industry, but soon turned into a failure due to the reduction of important supplies of German equipment. In an attempt to combat German influence, the government began inefficient and expensive imports of basic necessities from the United States.\n\nThis policy eventually led to the closure of most German businesses and increased unemployment. In 1929, the economic crisis in the United States led to the fact that short-term loans issued to Russian companies were withdrawn. This led to the collapse of the Russian economy, which was now left without most of the German enterprises and without American loans. Kerensky had no choice but to return to negotiations with Germany. At the Berlin Conference of 1930, Kerensky literally begged for the new loans from Germany, further strengthening German influence than before the policy of protectionism. All this, in general, led to a sharp increase in the popularity of Bukharin's NSP and Savinkov's NRPR."

russia.1024.t:0 "A Troubled History: Radicalization"
russia.1024.d:0 "Bukharin's People's Socialist Party was in a semi-legal position. On the one hand, fearing any manifestations of socialist discontent, Kerensky did not prohibit the activities of the 'New Bolsheviks'. On the other hand, the high threshold for passing to the Duma prevented the presence of any noticeable number of deputies from the NSP.\nThe popularity of the NPRP was very high. They had no flaw in their connection with the Bolsheviks, like Bukharin, and Savinkov was a respected figure during the Civil War.\n\nThe 1932 elections marked the beginning of the end of Kerensky's rule. Savinkov's party was able to overtake the Socialist-Revolutionaries in terms of the number of votes, and only a coalition of Kadets and Socialists-Revolutionaries, once again lobbied by Kerensky, was able to save the situation.\n\nRealizing the power of his influence, Savinkov began to actively promote his own ideas. Being a revolutionary and a supporter of terrorism, he creates the paramilitary wing of the party - the Combat Squads of the NPRP, aimed at a radical solution to the 'Kerensky problem'.\n\nOf course, this could not please the other parties in the Duma, who now saw Savinkov's party as a direct threat to democracy, nor Kerensky and the Senate, who saw Savinkov's party as a direct threat to their power.\n\nThe last years of the republic from 1932 to the present were largely devoted to the fight against radicalism within society: mass events were banned, and Kerensky strengthened anti-terrorist measures. The actual declaration of war was the violent dispersal of an anti-government demonstration of the people's Republicans by the police on the anniversary of the February Revolution in 1934. Attempts on senators and ministers became more frequent, and Kerensky began to think seriously about dissolving the Duma and banning Savinkov's party. However, to do this, he needed the help of the army - and with the commander-in-chief, Lavr Kornilov, he had strained relations, not to mention the more conservative officers who were still convinced monarchists. In 1935, workers ' strikes and clashes between socialists and People's Republicans became more frequent. In November 1935, Kerensky survived an armed attack, and who knows - maybe it will happen again."

russia.2.t:0 "The Russian Constitution of 1920"
russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1920, after the end of the Russian Civil War and three years after the February Revolution, the Constitution of the Russian Republic is a scar of the fractured White movement which saw its adoption. According to the Constitution, Russia, the Russian Democratic Federative Republic, is a democratic parliamentary federation of both national and territorial autonomous oblasts.\nThe legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate.\n\nIn some ways, the Constitution is an updated version of the Tsarist constitution of 1906 - the upper house of the Parliament, the Senate, is the main example of this authoritarian heritage. It is an institution composed of 150 senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations, 50 of whom are appointed by the regional legislatures, 50 - by the president and 50 - elected by the people with sufficient age (30 years) and higher education or social status (former aristocracy) or personal wealth. The lower house, the State Duma, is elected and holds most of the legislative power in the country. The presence of the unelected Senate curbs democratic process in the country, however.\n\nThe executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every four years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers. The Prime-Minister is the head of government, chosen by the Parliament and appointed by President. The Speaker of the Senate is chosen by the Senate and becomes acting president should the President become unable to serve. The new President is elected only after the term of the elected President comes to end.\n\nThe President is the primary actor in executing legislative acts and represents the Republic in foreign affairs. He also has access to the infamous Article 48 of the Constitution, which allows the President to take emergency actions without the approval of the Duma. President Alexander Kerensky has grown fond of using this power to bypass the increasingly fractured legislature and thus pass decrees and laws.\n\nDrafted under the guidance of the White Generals, the Constitution can only call itself a protector of democracy when its articles are not used against it."

russia.2017.t:0 "The Russian Economy"
russia.2017.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War in early 1920's, the Kerensky government attempted to recover the economy using a mix of socialist economic theories and the propositions of the Kadets and its supporters among the Russian capitalists. Kerensky recognised the de-facto redistribution of the land among the Russian peasants and restored private land ownership. Using the gold reserve of the Russian Empire, which during the Civil War was under Kolchak's control and later was transferred to Petrograd, Kerensky introduced a new currency and launched new economic policies which allowed him to recover the Tsarist industry, including military plants, and involving American investments in the various branches of the Russian economy. However, the reforms were not enough to fully industrialize the country and the slowing growth of the economy as well as the intensification of the confrontation between the right and left parts of the Russian establishment led to the recession in 1933. It is clear that the Russian industry still has great potential, which can strengthen the economy as well as the international position of the country."

The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than to impose harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support. Our citizens were already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets and Socialist Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Alexander Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."

russia.4.d:0 "With the stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions for our citizens during 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash. The only available option to amass sufficient capital to help our economy, was to force the Russian state to prematurely repay the remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Berlin conference in November 1935 president Alexandr Kerensky, together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov, were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastic austerity measures the Russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."

He suggests that Russia should rely on our huge numbers to win any future wars, but also insists that a motorisation of our forces is necessary. Wrangel, while not as widely respected as Denikin, is still popular with some parts of the military. He believes in discipline and is respected far and wide for his administrative abilities. With extensive planning and a general motorisation, he believes he can make the Russian army the greatest in the world! Shatilov is a veteran from both the front lines and the staff quarters. While not the first choice of the Military command he does have a circle of close allies who all advocate theories of overwhelming firepower, hammering enemy positions with artillery before attacking. Additionally, more initiative and responsibility needs to be given to the officer at the front-line. And finally, no one doubts the talents of Markov, put to display in every war since the Russo-Japanese one. During the Weltkrieg he was a close assistant to Denikin.

The same reform has been made by Bolsheviks in their \"The Decree On Land\" and later by Kerensky. However, the reform was not brought to a conclusion, as most of the land in Siberia belongs to the state and in Central Russia it is mostly private in hands of wealthy landowners. When the power is  in the hands of true PSR officials, we can carry it thorough finally."

An already unstable situation in Russia can become even more unstable and lead to armed conflicts with workers or nationalists.

russia.110.d:0 "The Duma is nothing but a strange mix of people with radically different views that argue how should our president govern the country. Kerensky was one of the first to understand that parliamentarism is an alien value, imposed by failed Canadian and French governments. Their parliamentarism led to socialist revolutions. With the dissolution of Duma as an useless holdover from the old days, we should empower the Senate - assembly of nobles, aristocrats, academicians and the most prominent Russian citizens."

russia.111.d:0 "All the power has been finally consolidated in the hands of one man - the only deserving candidate - President Kerensky. With the Duma dissolved, martial law invoked and state of emergency declared, nothing can stop Kerensky from achieving the ultimate goal - becoming the eternal president. Every sensible citizen understands - that both socialists and nationalist will ruin the country or drag it into war; and parliamentarism will lead to constant debates about simple solutions. While almost handling the power of an absolute Tsar, Kerensky will wisely govern, continuing to keep order in a falling apart Empire."

Now the government sees two real threats: underground organisations of Bolsheviks, wishing to establish soviet power again and NRPR Paramilitaries. Not only Savinkov's party is the second largest in Duma, but also we suspect them of terrorism, considering the past of their leader.

The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders.

We have to open our eyes to the fact that Bolshevism is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. That's exactly the reason why we should identify all its supporters and limit their influence to the life of the Russian Republic.' - with these words the main ideologist of the Russian "National Renewal" Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy explained the revocation of the right to vote as well as the part of the other civil rights for the members of the Bolshevik party and some former Soviet officials. With this measure, Boris Savinkov and NRPR are going to improve the situation in the Russian society and get rid of all these elements, who undermine the stability of Russia.\n\nThe October putsch, called a Revolution by some, left Russia changed forever. This means that it is very easy to blame Russia's faults and weaknesses not on inaction, not on the failures of the current government, but on the Bolsheviks who supposedly ruined it all - and the NRPR is sure to take advantage of this myth. History textbooks are being amended, a mass propaganda campaign started, and the message sent that the Bolshevik uprising was not just an ordinary uprising. An international conspiracy, one which sought to destroy holy Russia and make sure it never rises again, was responsible for funding the Bolshevik Party and supplying their uprising across central Russia, and were it not stopped by force of arms, it would have left Russia broken, destroyed and shattered. These textbooks make sure to note the fact that Vladimir Lenin had been sent to Petrograd by the Germans, and that many of the leading members of the Bolshevik Party were not Russian - Caucasians, Balts, Poles, and especially Jews."

It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the 'vox populi' about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."

I believe that this struggle will be continued and our Vozhd will revenge for all these young heroes, who were cowardly killed by the lefts. This struggle must finish with our victory.' - Ivan Shmelyov, Russian conservative writer, whose unarmed son was killed by the Reds at the end of the civil war, demands that Russian government should continue to fight against the left movements, such as Left SRs and Mensheviks not only in Moscow and Petrograd, but also in the various Russian regions. Though these parties were incredibly weakened by special government measures after Savinkov's rise to power and the killing of Maria Spiridonova and Boris Kamkov, their leaders in Russian regions definitely should be arrested and even executed, if necessary."

Enemies still lurk at every corner to him and the Syndicalists may come for his head any moment now. This is where one of the rising stars in the National Republican Party and the Deputy Minister of Interior, Viktor Abakumov, stepped in to offer a solution. To ensure that the Vozhd's rule is forever solid and his regime lasts a thousand years, the Russian nation must learn to fear, and above all else, its enemies must learn to fear.\n\nAbakunov's brainchild is a purge not from the top down, done via orders to arrest this dissident or that dissident, but instead from the bottom up. All regional governors need to be given quotas of "enemies of the state" they need to find, extract, and purge. Those who do not deserve a bullet to the back of the head should work off their debt instead - the Tsarist Okhrana laid the groundwork for deporting thousands of dissidents to Siberia, but this system can be modernized, industrialized, and turned into an archipelago of destruction. Even those who are not plotting against Russia must know their place - Abakunov offers to incentivize ratting out possible enemies of the state in workplaces, schools or even families, creating an atmosphere of worry and uncertainty under which the masses will flock to the only thing which can keep them safe, loyalty to the Vozhd.\n\nEven fellow members of the NRPR believe that Abakumov's proposal is...crazy, but Savinkov has taken personal interest in the proposal."

This movement of local nationalists became famous as the 'Left Separatists'. Though Boris Savinkov has accepted the new national policy, which should regulate and improve the relations between Russians and the Russian minorities, including groups disloyal to Petrograd, he cannot forget about the problem of the Left Separatists, which still exist even after the proscription of the Russian Left SR party and its allies.

In order to please the peasants and socialist supporters and voters, he passed the Land Socialization Bill, which originally should have abolished any private property considering land ownership. However, in order to appease the other side of the political spectrum, the liberals and conservatives, the Bill was adopted with some adjustments: while land in the most fertile lands was in a public ownership of special agricultural councils, private property over land was still legal in other areas of Russia. This, however, still led to various problems, including rising support for more radical parties in the country, rough going industrialization and difficulties with building new infrastructure.

RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1921 the All-Russian Constituent Assembly declared Russian Democratic Federative Republic. Since then the country has been ruled by an uneasy coalition of PSR-Kadets, maintained by Alexander Kerensky's leadership. By 1936 Kerensky has been ruling Russia for 15 years already, and different radical parties, such as Bukharin's NSP and Savinkov's NRPR gain power. Will Russia suffer great changes or will it maintain its fate as bastion of Eastern European Democracy?"

POLITICS_GORGULOV_DESC:0 "A Kuban Cossack writer and political ideologue, Pavel Gorgulov, otherwise known infamously as 'The Green Vozhd', became widely known for murdering Russian ex-president, Alexander Kerensky. During the Civil War, Pavel Gorgulov was engaged in subversive anti-bolshevik actions and got acquinted with Boris Savinkov. Gorgulov's views were influenced by Russian avant-garde poetic movements, such as New Peasant Poets, Imaginists and late Symbolists. Though his view became highly esoteric and even his subordinates aren't sure whether he is...sane. His emphasis on the peasantry culminates in his messianic belief that "wild, primitive, and Scythian" Russian civilization will prevail over Western civilization and establish a new order across the world.\n\nAfter Savinkov's takeover of Russia, Pavel Gorgulov was pardoned and subsequently released from jail. However, with the help of the Green Army, Pavel Gorgulov managed to overthrow Savinkov and install his own dictatorship. He will try to transform Russia into one of his dreams - a radically nationalist peasant agrarian state." 
POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC:0 "A terrorist, a revolutionary and a dictator is just a few of many labels given to Boris Savinkov, the leader of the People's Republican Party of Russia. Throughout his colorful life, he has assassinated and bombed many as a part of the Combat Organization of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, before moving on to becoming a pragmatic schemer behind Alexander Kerensky's back - as Assistant War Minister in 1917, he nearly assumed dictatorial power in Russia from the shadows, and only the collapse of the Kornilov coup led to his downfall. However, he rehabilitated himself by organizing the Union for the Defense of the Motherland, an underground resistance organization in Moscow which prepared the soil for the city's fall in 1919.\n\nSavinkov may have once been a socialist, but he has long since abandoned the weak Socialist Revolutionaries in favor of a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced him over the years - all of which merge into a system of totalitarian dictatorial rule, agrarian Socialist-Revolutionary policy, Orthodox Christianity and a concept of palingenetic rebirth: like an eagle rising from the ashes, the Vozhd shall restore the glory of the Russian state and transform it into a hegemon of reaction." 
POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_TSAR_DESC:0 "Among Russian generals of Baltic German birth, of which there are many, Pyotr IV Wrangel is perhaps the most famous. A talented cavalry officer from a family which gifted several commanders to the Imperial Russian Army, Wrangel distinguished himself during the Brusilov Offensive, where he showed himself as an aggressive yet trustworthy commander. For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Wrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist. And no matter what he might do, his officers will follow him regardless - to this day, junior officers in the Army ask themselves "If Tsar Pyotr was here, what would he do?""
POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Born to a Russian father and Polish mother, Anton Denikin chose to embrace the patriotism of the former, and tied the rest of his life with the Imperial Russian Army. By the Great War, he was a major general and a chief of staff in Kiev Military District, and a prolific writer who analysed the shortcomings of the Russian army. A second in command to Lavr Kornilov, he escaped to Southern Russia alongside him and helped form the Volunteer Army which would ultimately put an end to the Bolshevik revolution. It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment. Politics are the last thing on his mind, but should he end up in power one way or another, Denikin's experience in the Russian chief of staff will lead to him commanding the nation like he used to command his regiment."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexandr Fyodorovich Kerensky, born 1881 is the First and only President of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic so far. To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Alexander Kerensky, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerensky sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks.\n\nKerensky returned to power in 1921, as the first President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerensky marks his fifteenth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerensky established land reform, though never fully finishing it, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the new economic program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerensky has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition.\nIn case of trouble, unknown forces could attempt to remove Kerensky from power and seize control of Russia."

POLITICS_IRAKLIY_TSERETELI_DESC:0 "A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakliy Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognize the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."
POLITICS_VIKTOR_CHERNOV_DESC:0 "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasiliy Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1921, Chernov and Kerensky formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last fifteen years. While Kerensky was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."
POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerensky's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Alexander Kerensky. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."
POLITICS_NIKOLAI_TRUBETSKOY_DESC:0 "Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy represents a new generation of Russian nobility, an educated, ideologically driven upper class which is opposed to radicalism from the right and from the left. A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Eurasianist Party", a conservative party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pyotr Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

POLITICS_PAVEL_BERMONDT_AVALOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Bermondt-Avalov is a talented Russian general, who unlike the majority of White officers was a leader of Pro-German forces during the Civil War. An anti-soviet organisation he created during the Civil War was called the West Russian Voluntary Army or Bermontians. In 1919 he proclaimed West Russian Government in the United Baltic Duchy, however, was unrecognized by the Government of Kolchak. The German Intervention in 1920 was headed by Bermondt-Avalov and after the defeat of Soviets, he became famous for signing the Minsk Treaty along with President Kerensky, Foreign Minister Milyukov and Chief of Army Kornilov. Since then Bermondt-Avalov has been a leading figure in the Russian pro-German movements. However, it is unlikely that he will be able to make Russia a German puppet."

POLITICS_VASILY_MAKLAKOV_DESC:0 "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasiliy Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defense of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticized Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigoriy Semyenov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1921 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."
POLITICS_TYRKOVA_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the VNS. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalized her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead. \n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Eurasianist Party. Russia's first democratically elected female head of state has a deeply conservative society to resist against, but she is no pushover, and will not shy away to assert Russia's role as the harbringer of Eurasia."

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect. \n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armored train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armored vehicles and maneouvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."
POLITICS_LAVR_KORNILOV_DESC:0 "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerensky's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_SHLIAPNIKOV_DESC:0 "Born from a family of poor Old Believers, Alexander Shlyapnikov worked in various factories in Petrograd since he was thirteen and grew to become an ardent revolutionary. Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labor for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticized their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern. \n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Alexandera Kollontay, he founded the Trade Unions Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."
POLITICS_KARL_RADEK_DESC:0 "Karl Radek would struggle to count the number of socialist movements he's had a hand in over the years. Born in Austria-Hungary to a Jewish Litvak family, he joined the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and participated in the Revolution of 1905 in Warsaw - only to get expelled a few years later as a part of an anti-semitic and anti-Leninist campaign within the party. Briefly, he worked for the German SPD, before getting expelled as well. He worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did not stay in Russia either, however - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser. \n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life, however - instead of executing him like what the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans and was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through use of extensive state planning, in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."
POLITICS_ALEKSEY_RYKOV_DESC:0 "Born from rural Russian peasantry, Aleksey Rykov was an early member of Social Democratic Labour's Bolshevik faction and a supporter of Vladimir Lenin over his political rivals in the movement. After returning from exile in Siberia in 1917, he joined the October Revolution, although he disagreed with the radical inclinations of the Bolshevik movement, and was put in charge of the fledgling Soviet state's industry. During this period, he organized the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

Her leftist sympathies began when she was sent to Western Europe to distance her from a relationship with a poor fellow student, and she started reading into radical leftist literature during the exile. During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Alexander Shlyapnikov. \n\nKollontay was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."
POLITICS_NIKOLAI_BUKHARIN_DESC:0 "Born in a middle class family in the capital of Russia, Bukharin has been a member of the Russian far left for the last three decades. He was an early member of Social Democratic Labour and its Bolshevik faction, convened the conference which founded its youth movement, the Komsomol, and maintained contact with the rest of the party while in exile in the West. There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Alexander Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik. \n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organized the right faction of Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party. Wary of possible bureaucratization and "military-feudal exploitation" of the peasantry, Bukharin endorses a moderate approach of cautious industrialization and an alliance between the proletariat and peasantry, as well some elements of market economy."

Though educated as a cavalry officer, he graduated with a report how the cavalry is growing obsolete in the face of motorized forces. He served dutifully in the Weltkrieg and participated in the Brusilov Offensive, but his attitude changed when the February Revolution broke out. An avowed monarchist, Kappel remained silent at first, hoping for a restoration of the Romanov order once the situation stabilizes, but soon began to plot with other future White generals. When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade. After the end of the Bolshevik uprising, Kappel remained in the army and became one of the most important generals in its infantry corps.

He graduated at the top of his class from the prestigious Pavlovsk Military School and fought in the Russo-Japanese War as an officer in the Life Guards Regiment, where he remained on the front lines despite injury and received several decorations for heroism. In the years that followed, he tried several prospective careers, including submarines and aircraft, but ultimately decided to stick to ground forces. His real career began after the February Revolution, when he was the first to denounce the authority of the republican government in Moscow and disobeyed orders. Stationed in Romania, he watched the Bolshevik takeover from afar and formed a military unit of his own, the Drozdovites, which marched off to join Mikhail Alekseyev's Volunteer Army in the Don.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he gained the reputation of a talented and strict, if reckless commander, who always made sure to assert that he was fighting for the holy House of Romanov. Though the dynasty was not restored, Drozdovskiy continues to harbor hopes that the throne will be assumed by a righteous monarch of noble blood one day, and until that day comes, he has crafted a complex plan for the reform of the Russian army to bring it to modern standards."

Loyal to Lavr Kornilov, he joined the Volunteer Army in the Don and became a commanding officer in the high command. This is where he gained the nickname of the "Bad Luck General". Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovskiy stood by the Republic. His undiplomatic character means that he's been delayed in promotions, but his talent in warfare cannot be mistaken - he is a capable artillery commander and an expert in firepower concentration."

The tight-lipped, mild-mannered, apolitical general has kept his former sympathies towards the Bolshevik Revolution under wraps - not long after Lenin's death at the hands of Fanny Kaplan, he defected from the Red Army, returning to demobilization once again and rejoining the Russian army in 1923. Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare. \n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilization never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilization and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war.

After the Civil War, he returned to the Kuban Host, hoping to serve among his countrymen and keep them loyal to the new regime in Moscow. A few years later, however, Pyotr Krasnov raised the banner of rebellion and Naumenko was one of the few notable Cossack leaders who openly resisted him. In battles across the steppes, however, Naumenko was eventually routed and the remnants of his unit escaped to Tsaritsyn.

Even at a young age, he did not lack ambition - once the Weltkrieg began, he proudly declared that he will either be a general at thirty or dead by then. After showing skill and bravery in the Eastern Front, Tukhachevskiy fulfilled this goal - but not in the way he anticipated. He joined the Red Army as a volunteer and rapidly rose in rank, becoming a close associate to Leon Trotsky and achieving the rank of General not long after Lenin's assassination. The Fifth Army he commanded was one of the Red Army's finest units and pioneered the concept of motorized concentration warfare, but was ultimately defeated by Vladimir Kappel.\n\nAlongside several high ranking Bolsheviks and Red Army leaders, Tukhahevskiy escaped to France, a nation he was already familiar with, and offered his service to the newly established Commune. In the following years, he dedicated his time to essay after essay on the reforms which he believed the French army needs - his close associates said that he owns over a hundred volumes on military tactics and has read every single one. Tukhachevskiy expressed dismay at the decentralized, Syndicalist structure of the Commune, believing it unfit for modern warfare, and proposed the creation of a unified, centralized, apolitical army. Because of this, he came into constant conflict with the Faure government, but the CGT could not simply remove him from the academy - even they understood that Tukhachevskiy was the best general which the Internationale has available.\n\nTo resolve this, he and the other Bolsheviks were sent to Patagonia to lead a military mission to help the Argentinean Revolution."

Early in his life, he got drawn to Georgian nationalist poetry and enrolled in the Tiflis Seminary, but abandoned his previous calling when he came into contact with socialist literature. He dedicated himself to Marxism, joined the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, and raised money for the revolution with protection rackets, counterfeiting and bank robberies. He was a loyal follower of Lenin and represented the party in the public by running the newspaper 'Pravda', and his articles there helped make a name for himself as well.\n\nDuring the fateful months of 1917, Dzhugashvili helped organize the July Days uprising and the October Revolution, and gained a seat in the Sovnarkom. He, Lenin and Trotsky formed the informal troika which controlled the state - as a result, Dzhugashvili was sent to Tsaritsyn to organize resistance against the Whites, where he showed himself as an okay, if reckless commander. Once Lenin was assassinated in August 1918, it was Trotsky who took charge and not him - but the Soviet state was not one to last, eventually collapsing. Dzhugashvili, unlike Trotsky, managed to escape, making his way to France with the rest of the Bolshevik remnants, and helped reestablish the Party in exile.\n\nTo support the Patagonian Syndicalist revolution, Dzhugashvili was sent to the Southern Cone alongside a mission of other Bolsheviks, and alongside Tukhachevskiy, he is one of the highest ranking Internationale officials in Patagonia, albeit unlike Tukhachevskiy, representing the political interests of the Internationale.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Aligned with the Communist faction."

RUS_Spearhead_Doctrine:0 "Reform the Army: Markov's Plan"
RUS_Spearhead_Doctrine_desc:0 "No one doubts the talents of Markov, put to display in every war since the Russo-Japanese one. During the Weltkrieg he was a close assistant to Denikin.

Still, Russian tank armies, swift strikes through enemy lines! What a thought!"

RUS_Local_Training_Barracks_desc:0 "Every city, every town, every hamlet should hold their own army barracks, where low ranking officers train the local men into militia formations.

RUS_War_Under_The_Sea:0 "Reform the Navy: Monastyriov Plan"
RUS_War_Under_The_Sea_desc:0 "While carriers and battleships may be the future, it may not be realistic for our young republic to focus on these massive ships. Building a large navy is expensive and [RUS.GetNameDef] does not have the dockyards nor the resources to produce a fleet of that size. Instead we should focus on the cheaper but equally deadly submarines to harass enemy shipping lanes."

RUS_The_Invisible_Navy:0 "The Invisible Navy"
RUS_The_Invisible_Navy_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg taught us that it isn't always the biggest naval gun that wins the war. Cheap, silent and deadly submarines can bring entire empires to their knees. With our shipbuilding capacity limited by Brest-Litovsk, focusing on these types of vessels will allow us to quickly regain an offensive capacity in the deep oceans."

RUS_Coastal_Defences:0 "Coastal Defences"
RUS_Coastal_Defences_desc:0 "Because our naval capacity has historically been less than that of our natural rivals, many of our naval theoreticians are advocating for a defensive stance against the enemy. By focusing on mining the seas, we could limit their movement at sea and cause losses to their fleets while exposing ourselves to minimal risks."

RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada:0 "A Destroyer Armada"
RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada_desc:0 "Destroyers are the backbone of every navy. Considering the fact that the Reichspakt's dominance in the Baltics, this will be doubly true for us.

RUS_Fleet_Protectors:0 "Fleet Protectors"
RUS_Fleet_Protectors_desc:0 "Until we finish our naval expansion program every ship is valuable and difficult to replace.

RUS_Commerce_Raiders:0 "Commerce Raiders"
RUS_Commerce_Raiders_desc:0 "Modern cruisers have proved very effective in the past as commerce raiders by combining good mobility with great firepower. Given their potential and our need to strike at the arteries of our enemies, we should devote more resources towards maximizing their effectiveness in this particular role."

RUS_Fleet_Vanguards:0 "Fleet Vanguards"
RUS_Fleet_Vanguards_desc:0 "Striking a middle ground between larger battleships and smaller screens, cruisers are a versatile type of ship that can strike hard without being a 'white elephant' for the enemy to strike down. By modernizing their offensive gunnery we'll effectively turn these ships into pocket battleships, hard-hitting ships able to stand up to capital ships in a fight."

RUS_Naval_Infantry:0 "Naval Infantry"
RUS_Naval_Infantry_desc:0 "Landings against fortified enemy islands or beaches carried out by regular infantry without special training and equipment is a disaster waiting to happen.

RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships:0 "New Tactics for New Ships"
RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships_desc:0 "Modern ships are barely any more useful than the ships of the last century if we don't update our naval doctrine as well.

RUS_Modernise_The_Petrograd_Dockyards_desc:0 "With Petrograd being the largest port city in western Russia it's only natural that it will serve as the linchpin for any fleet expansion project.

RUS_Modernise_Murmansk:0 "Modernise Murmansk"
RUS_Modernise_Murmansk_desc:0 "As a gateway into the Barents Sea, Murmansk could be turned into a pivotal strategic location for our northern navy. Though its facilities are as of yet under-developed, expanding them could allow us to move submarines and other ships into the North Sea and beyond into the Atlantic, bypassing any western navies in the Baltic Sea."

RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints:0 "Recover Foreign Blueprints"
RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints_desc:0 "As a result of the decades lost to turmoil, we've fallen significantly behind several of our competitors. With the right resources and connections, however, we could learn from their efforts to speed up our own naval research program."

RUS_Submarines_In_Kamchatka:0 "Submarines in Kamchatka"
RUS_Submarines_In_Kamchatka_desc:0 "The loss of Vladivostok primed a generation of naval reformers to focus on smaller and more cost-effective ways to safeguard the Pacific.

RUS_Repair_Sevastopol_desc:0 "With Crimea once again under Russian control we finally have a warm water port to the south and a permanent foothold in the Black Sea.

RUS_Battleship_Development:0 "Battleship Development"
RUS_Battleship_Development_desc:0 "From the carracks of old to the contemporary dreadnoughts, capital ships have been the centerpiece of every major navy for countless centuries. Building these mighty warships isn't just a massive boon to our navies, but also a clear sign to the rest of the world that we have overcome the injustices of Brest-Litovsk once and for all."

RUS_Carrier_Development:0 "Carrier Development"
RUS_Carrier_Development_desc:0 "While the old guard speaks fondly of battleships, a new generation of naval theoreticians speak of the potential of the aircraft carrier as the future centerpiece of our navies. Each of these floating airfields can carry an armada of fighters and bombers directly into the heart of our foes, giving us unmatched power projection potential."

rusfor.2.d:0 "Russia has recaptured the positions in the Caucasus their Empire has held before. This, and the recent surge of Arabian nationalism, originating from Egypt and Hashemite Arabia, puts our state and its foreign interest in grave danger. To have any hope to survive the approaching struggles with our hostile Arabian neighbours, we must quickly stabilise our eastern borders. The Sultan plans to send Prince Nihad to propose a non-aggression treaty with Russia."
rusfor.2.a:0 "Send the Prince!"

rusfor.3.t:0 "Non-Aggression Pact with the Ottomans"

Both sides of the pact are to recognise the current state of the border between the Ottoman Empire and Russia. How shall we respond to this proposal?"
rusfor.3.a:0 "We need security too, sign the pact!"

rusfor.6.t:0 "Non-Aggression pact with Ottomans was signed"

It's a grand success for Russian diplomacy!"
rusfor.6.a:0 "Hooray!"

rusfor.7.t:0 "The Crimean Peninsula"
rusfor.7.d:0 "For years now our naval chiefs have lamented our lack of presence in the Black Sea, a sea once dominated by the Russian Navy. Our new Ukrainian allies are very grateful to us for liberating them from foreign domination, and they may be willing to lease us the Crimea as a naval base in exchange for Russian technical expertise and financial compensation."
rusfor.7.a:0 "Try to lease the Crimea."

Or perhaps - act tricky and demand our presence at the Congress."

rusfor.16.t:0 "The Answer from Russia"
rusfor.16.d:0 "The Russian refused our advances, saying that we are not Slavs to participate in the congress. We should get our troops ready and increase the amount of police officers in the Slavic-majority cities and get ready for anything."
rusfor.16.a:0 "Damn Russians!"

rusfor.17.d:0 "The Russians suprisingly agreed to give us voting rights at the Panslavic Congress. Perhaps, they believe to solve the problem peacefully, or they think that they will outnumber us."

rusfor.20.b:0 "Vojvodina is Croatia"

rusfor.21.t:0 "Unite South Slavs?"

rusfor.1088.d:0 "The Japanese are not happy that we are interfering in Transamur's internal politics and have warned us that it is rightfully a Japanese protectorate. However, they have other military concerns at the moment and may not be willing to risk a two front war to protect a colony of minimal importance."

rusfor.1236.d.defeat:0 "The forces of the resurgent Russian state have begun moving against us in earnest, seeking to reconquer Bessarabia; and as valiant as our efforts may be, ultimately it was in vain. Our forces put up a good fight but were pushed aside, and now the country is holding its breath in anticipation of the hardships of a Russian invasion. There may be hope however, if we sue for peace and cede Bessarabia, the Bear's wrath may be abated just enough to save our country."

rusfor.1237.d.defeat:0 "Disaster! Our attempt to march into Bessarabia and reclaim that which is ours has been met with far more resistance than we originally envisioned! Not only have the Romanians held off the brunt of the initial assault, but they have also managed to repel us for quite some time by now! If this embarrassment continues, our military machine will become the laughingstock of the world! Our foreign ministry recommends we accept their terms, although this may not be seen in the best light by our people..."

rusfor.1265.d:0 "White Ruthenia was occupied by the Germans in 1918 and later Berlin installed a loyal regime with the German prince on the top. Now however, the White Ruthenian economy is unstable and weak. We can reach an agreement about the purchase of almost all their state bonds, and if they agree with it, we will be able to control their economy, their government, and maybe eventually fully incorporate the country."
rusfor.1265.a:0 "Let's buy them!"

rusfor.1266.b:0 "Maybe the Germans will be able to help us."
rusfor.1266.c:0 "We don't need the Russian money!"

rusfor.1267.t:0 "White Ruthenia agrees!"
rusfor.1267.d:0 "Good news from Minsk! The government of White Ruthenia has decided to sell their state bonds to us! Finally the former kingdom is under our direct control and we have become closer to the reunification of the Russian lands!"

rusfor.12677.d:0 "Bad news from Minsk! The government of White Ruthenia has rejected our offer to sell their state bonds to us. What shall we do?"

rusfor.12677.b:0 "Back down..."

rusfor.1268.t:0 "Integration"
rusfor.1268.d:0 "The former kingdom of White Ruthenia was long enough under our control. Should we finally reincorporate it into Russia?"
rusfor.1268.a:0 "Yes, of course!"
rusfor.1268.b:0 "Leave them with autonomy"

rusfor.1269.t:0 "White Ruthenia needs our help!"
rusfor.1269.d:0 "The government of White Ruthenia wants our support, because Russia is going to buy their state bonds to control the economy of this small country. It seems that if we don't intervene, White Ruthenia will be soon annexed by the Russians!"
rusfor.1269.a:0 "Warn Russia, they must turn back!"
rusfor.1269.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1270.t:0 "Germany supports White Ruthenia!"
rusfor.1270.d:0 "The Germans don't allow us to buy White Ruthenian state bonds. It seems that the Germans are ready to defend their sphere of influence in the Eastern Europe. What should we do?"

rusfor.1271.a:0 "Let's cooperate with the Russians!"
rusfor.1271.b:0 "We will fight alone!"

rusfor.1272.t:0 "White Ruthenia is alone!"
rusfor.1272.d:0 "The German government doesn't want to protect White Ruthenia. But White Ruthenia isn't going to sell us their state bonds. Maybe we should take back our lands, using our army?"
rusfor.1272.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1272.b:0 "We don't need White Ruthenia."

rusfor.12722.t:0 "Russia is threatening our hold on White Ruthenia!"
rusfor.12722.d:0 "Russia offered our puppet White Ruthenia to buy some of its state bonds and is now going to control most of its economy. Unfortunately the White Ruthenian government accepted this offer and Russia is now closer than ever from annexing White Ruthenia to their empire for good. Should we intervene?"
rusfor.12722.a:0 "Unacceptable! We'll take back our puppet!"
rusfor.12722.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1273.t:0 "Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia."
rusfor.1273.d:0 "After the annexation of Central Asia, we got many new Muslim citizens, who were ruled before by the local obscurantist priests and preachers. It is obvious, that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."
rusfor.1273.a:0 "Create a new Spiritual Administration."
rusfor.1273.b:0 "Orenburg Assembly will deal with it!"

rusfor.1274.t:0 "Problems in Central Asia."
rusfor.1274.d:0 "Though we have established a new Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia, but it is still controlled mainly by the same priests, who had been playing a significant role in Central Asia since the Civil war till the annexation. Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."
rusfor.1274.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusfor.1275.t:0 "Pacification of Central Asia."
rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
rusfor.1275.a:0 "That's great!"

rusfor.1276.t:0 "Control over Azerbaijan"
rusfor.1276.d:0 "Since we have given our guarantees to Azerbaijan, the Russian business uses the profits of the cooperation between two countries. Maybe now it is the best time to expand our control over this Caucasian country and strengthen our positions in the Caspian region?"
rusfor.1276.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1276.b:0 "We don't need it."

rusfor.1277.t:0 "Restoring control over the Northern Caucasus."
rusfor.1277.d:0 "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a:0 "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."
rusfor.1277.b:0 "Continue Krasnov's policy - support the Terek Cossack Host and its nations."
rusfor.1277.c:0 "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1278.d1:0 "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transfered the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has begun to recover very quickly, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.d2:0 "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.d3:0 "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations. But in the non-Russian parts of the region only some Christian nations support our army, while in some Muslim villages the local people try to start a guerrilla against Russia. No doubt we will stop it and punish the criminals, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is restored."
rusfor.1279.d:0 "More than six months have passed since we had retaken Don-Kuban Union. We could finally restore control over the whole region and set up a new local authorities, which help us to pacify Northern Caucasus. The local Russians and other Christian nations have strengthened their positions and are finally free from raids and attacks of the hostile tribes, rebellious nations accepted our rule and the criminals who fought against us either died or immigrated. The new era of the prosperity in the Russian South finally starts!"
rusfor.1279.a:0 "Perfect!"

rusfor.12800.a:0 "Perfect!"

rusfor.12810.t:0 "The Ottomans are Collapsing!"
rusfor.12810.d:0 "As the War in the Desert reaches a climax, it seems the Ottoman Empire has reached a point of complete collapse, and their forces are in full retreat from Mesopotamia and the Levant. This is a perfect opportunity for us to regain the provinces of Greater Armenia, as the alternative for them is to declare war on us."
rusfor.12810.a:0 "Give the order!"
rusfor.12810.b:0 "This is too risky."

rusfor.12820.t:0 "Russia Seizes Greater Armenia!"
rusfor.12820.d.OTT:0 "Russia has taken advantage of our weakness to occupy our Eastern provinces. With our military in tatters following the war with the Cairo Axis, it would be suicidal to try and stop them."
rusfor.12820.d.other:0 "Russia has taken advantage of the Ottoman weakness to occupy their Eastern provinces of Kars and Ardahan, considered part of Greater Armenia."
rusfor.12820.a:0 "We will remember this."
rusfor.12820.b:0 "Not our problem."

rusfor.1280.t:0 "What do to with Kuban?"
rusfor.1280.d:0 "The lands of the Kuban Cossack hosts at the Black Sea, was historically a part of the Russian Empire until, during the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution and ensuing Civil War and German Intervention. Russia seems ready to reincorporate this petty state into the Motherland. How shall we proceed? Whatever course of action we take, we must be prepared for a conflict of interests with Ukraine, as they will certainly not take lightly our ambitions, especially towards a state friendly to them."
rusfor.1280.a:0 "Start consulting with Ukraine."
rusfor.1280.b:0 "Start sending agitators."

rusfor.1281.t:0 "Russia wants to seize Kuban"
rusfor.1281.d:0 "The Russian ambassador has approached the minister of foreign affairs about the [KUB.GetNameDef]. If we withdraw support for the Cossacks and allow the annexation Russia would be much more eager to cooperate with us. Let's remember that Russia has many means of interfering in Don-Kuban so even if we refuse to talk the situation in the Caucasus can change."
rusfor.1281.a:0 "The Russians are right, it's a part of their country."
rusfor.1281.b:0 "[KUB.GetNameDef] is our partner! Never."

rusfor.1284.t:0 "Kuban surrendered!"
rusfor.1284.d:0 "They are coming back to the Motherland."

rusfor.1285.t:0 "Ukraine refuse to give up on Kuban"
rusfor.1285.d:0 "Despite our best efforts the Ukranians have refused to withdraw their guarantee of independence of the Kuban Host. We must think about other ways of seizing the Cossack state."
rusfor.1285.b:0 "Leave them be for now."

rusfor.1286.t:0 "The country is thrown into chaos!"
rusfor.1286.d:0 "Russian agitators has fuelled popular opinion against the Cossacks. The Russians in our countryside and in our cities have rebelled. The Country is in chaos, what will happen next?"

rusfor.1288.t:0 "Status of Kalmykia"
rusfor.1288.d:0 "A nation, populated by buddhists and Astrakhan Cossacks was once a great Khanate, but now it is a pawn before the queen. Kalmykia gained its independence recently and is an unrecognized state so there will be no problem in crushing it."

### Events ###
rusd.1.t:0 "Political Bombings"
rusd.1.d:0 "The Anarchists, Socialists, Syndicalists and Bolsheviks are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, one of them assassinated a famous General. God only knows who they will kill next time!"
rusd.1.a:0 "I want the head of the bomber on my desk!"

rusd.3.t:0 "Failure of a Bombing Plot"
rusd.3.d:0 "The Anarchists, Socialists, Syndicalists and Bolsheviks are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, they caused a panic in one of the major Russian cities when an assassin tried to kill a famous government representative. Thankfully the bomb went off too early, killing only a few people."

rusd.4.t:0 "Peasant Unrest"
rusd.4.d:0 "Throughout Russian history the peasants' living conditions has always been hard, even during periods of peace and prosperity. Even the emancipation reforms of 1861, which led to the abolition of serfdom, did not improve the situation all that much. Local peasant protests against their grim position, as well as landowners' illegal actions, were common."
rusd.4.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.5.t:0 "Agitation in the Countryside"
rusd.5.d:0 "With the situation in the countryside growing increasingly unstable, the peasants are becoming easy to influence, with various agitators taking advantage of the unrest. One such situation has recently taken place; a charismatic activist visited a number of villages calling for open revolt against our regime. How should we react to this potential threat?"
rusd.5.a:0 "Let him agitate, we have more important business."
rusd.5.b:0 "Eliminate the agitator!"

rusd.6.t:0 "Major Peasant Unrest"
rusd.6.d:0 "Agitated by various groups, the impoverished peasantry has risen up. The local administration is powerless against the mob and it seems that the only way to solve the crisis is to use force. Alternatively we can always attempt to negotiate, although satisfying the peasants' demands may turn out to be quite expensive."
rusd.6.a:0 "Send the army to eliminate the threat!"
rusd.6.b:0 "Attempt to negotiate and fulfil some of their demands."
rusd.6.c:0 "Fully agree to the peasants' demands."

rusd.7.t:0 "Workers' Demonstrations"
rusd.7.d:0 "Even though technological advancement resulted in a slow but steady improvement of working conditions, the workers remained very vulnerable to Socialist agitation. Demonstrations in cities were organised from time to time, their demands varying depending on who was pulling the strings."
rusd.7.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.8.t:0 "Workers' Strike"
rusd.8.d:0 "Some workers in one of our cities have organised themselves and began to strike, completely disrupting all industrial production within the city. They demand higher salaries and enforcement of labour regulations preventing unfair treatment of the workforce."
rusd.8.a:0 "Fulfil their demands."
rusd.8.b:0 "Ignore their demands."
rusd.8.c:0 "Send in the army to pacify them!"

rusd.9.t:0 "Negotiating with the Strikers"
rusd.9.d:0 "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. All political forces in the country closely watch the meeting, and some are hoping that the strike will become an impulse for further reforms in Russia."
rusd.9.a:0 "Stall the negotiations."
rusd.9.b:0 "Reach an agreement, but keep the reforms to a minimum."
rusd.9.c:0 "Reach a thorough agreement."

rusd.10.t:0 "Harsh Measures"
rusd.10.d:0 "The commander of a local army garrison has proposed that we use brute force in order to disperse the strikers and force them to go back to work."
rusd.10.a:0 "Why not? It's quicker than those negotiations!"
rusd.10.b:0 "No, we must not be too harsh."

rusd.11.t:0 "The Strikers give up!"
rusd.11.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The workers, seeing little success in their efforts, are about to call off the strike."
rusd.11.a:0 "Splendid!"

rusd.12.t:0 "The Workers Return to the Factories"
rusd.12.d:0 "With the crisis resolved, the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
rusd.12.a:0 "Excellent!"

rusd.13.t:0 "General Strike"
rusd.13.d:0 "Workers organisations all over the Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike. Even though the response to their initiative has been rather limited so far, it is very possible that more and more workers will join the strike, should the situation continue to deteriorate."
rusd.13.a:0 "Damned Socialists!"

rusd.14.t:0 "General Strike expands"
rusd.14.d:0 "Workers from other factories have joined the general strike. The situation is on the brink of eruption."
rusd.14.a:0 "We must be prepared for the worst!"

rusd.19.t:0 "Blackhundreds Overthrow The Government"
rusd.19.d:0 "The rigging was suspected and the RNSMA has overthrown the government with the help of pro-monarchist officers. The arrests of socialists have already started and it seems that the situation is bad for the republican forces. Now they have the only way to escape or to accept the new regime."
rusd.19.a:0 "Long Live Monarchy!"

rusd.20.t:0 "Blackhundredists restore the monarchy."

rusd.21.t:0 "Revolution!"
rusd.21.d:0 "The Bolshevik workers are demanding a return to the proletarian government, the peasants are seizing lands from the state and the Internationale is heard once more on the streets of the capital! A council of Soviets has been formed and is claiming political authority equal to our government!"
rusd.21.a:0 "The Constitution forbids such a thing!"

rusd.22.t:0 "Senate Seizes Power"
rusd.22.d:0 "It's been almost 6 months since the political crisis in Russia has started. Today several high senators proclaimed the Senate's sovereignity in Russian Republic. Moreover, they argue, according to the constitution, as Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov is current acting president of Russia, it is his supreme duty to restore the control in the country. The Senate, due to the Duma's unability to form a coalition and elect the government, proclaims Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov an incumbent President of the Russian Republic."
rusd.22.a:0 "Another Romanov?"
rusd.23.d:0 "PSR was unable to secure its weak power across in Russia. Today several high military commanders, under the leadership of Lavr Kornilov, with the help of Russian Army have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities. NSP members have been arrested and are going to be judged for treason against the Motherland."

rusd.24.t:0 "Military coup d'etat"
rusd.24.d:0 "PSR was unable to secure its weak power across in Russia. Today several high military commanders, under the leadership of Lavr Kornilov, with the help of Russian Army have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities."
rusd.24.a:0 "Kornilov shall save Holy Russia!"

rusd.25.t:0 "Rumors of a plot"
rusd.25.d:0 "There are rumors that some high military generals are planning a coup against our government. We have a choice to purge them, however our army is in weak position and purging talented generals can only make the things complicated."
rusd.25.a:0 "Purge them."
rusd.25.b:0 "We'll try to bring them over"

rusd.26.t:0 "Riot in Petrograd!"
rusd.26.d:0 "Today there is an armed riot in Petrograd. At first, workers have organized a strike, but it quickly exploded in a mass unrest. The most worrying is however that some of the officers refused to disperse a crowd and joined them. The situation is getting out of control and we should make an important decision."
rusd.26.a:0 "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."
rusd.26.b:0 "Try to negotiate with their leaders."

rusd.27.t:0 "The riot expands!"
rusd.27.d:0 "We were unable to negotiate with their leaders and now the riot has expanded to the neighbouring regions. The similar situation is in Moscow and other large industrial cities. We should do something now, or else the rebels can seize the control of the government."
rusd.27.a:0 "Shoot them."

rusd.28.t:0 "Victory of Revolutionaries!" 
rusd.28.d:0 "Military Junta was unable to secure its weak power across in Russia. Today several high military commanders, led by Zhukov, have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities. Kornilov's government has been arrested, while some White generals escaped to Transamur. However, the Siberia is still uncontrolled by us, and Kolchak is likely to capture these territories."
rusd.28.a:0 "Red Army is the Strongest!"

russia.1946.t:0 "Parts of the Russian Navy defects"
russia.1946.d:0 "Ships that were loyal to the rotten capitalist Russian state have now joined us in an effort to bring the ideals of Lenin to the remaining parts of Russia."
russia.1946.a:0 "A new Red Navy!"

rusd.30.t:0 "[TRM.GetName] Seizes More Land!"
rusd.30.d:0 "We are unsuccesful in reaching our territory so far away from the capital. The [TRM.GetAdjective] government used the panic in the region to capture it."
rusd.30.a:0 "We must act quickly!"

rusd.31.t:0 "Seize Eastern Karelia?"
rusd.31.d:0 "[RUS.GetName] is now in a weak position. A chaotic revolution led to insurgency in Siberia and strengthening of Transamur. We can take an advantage of the situation and capture Eastern Karelia - the land that is ought to be ours!"
rusd.31.a:0 "Capture Karelia."
rusd.31.b:0 "Better not provoke the Russians."

rusd.32.t:0 "[FIN.GetName] Seizes Eastern Karelia!"
rusd.32.d:0 "Finnish Nationalists have taken advantage of our yet weak power and have invaded Eastern Karelia, cutting us off our naval base in Murmansk. We can intervene now and secure our Northern Base at a risk of losing land to Don-Kuban or Transamur."
rusd.32.a:0 "Secure the Murmansk!"
rusd.32.b:0 "Focus on Siberia!"

rusd.33.t:0 "Russians Abandoned Murmansk!"
rusd.33.d:0 "After our invasion of Eastern Karelia, new Russian government has decided to abandon Murmansk. We have nothing but to receive this gift with open hands!"
rusd.33.a:0 "Invade Murmansk."

rusd.34.t:0 "Install puppet government in Karelia?"
rusd.34.d:0 "Our success in seizing Karelia is not only caused by weakness of Russian socialist government, but also by fellow Karelians who wished to be a part of Finland. We might grant them autonomy for their assistance."
rusd.34.a:0 "Give Karelia autonomy"
rusd.34.b:0 "Aren't they happy without it?"

rusd.35.t:0 "Status of the Orthodox Church"
rusd.35.d:0 "Article 5 of the Constitution of the Russian Republic states that 'Russia is henceforth a state in which no faith or belief can have privileges and rights which other faiths do not share, and religion does not have a say in government'. For a country which, up to that point, was built upon the Russian Orthodox Church, this was a rather shocking change in policy which many people could not agree with. In 1927, the Church saw a new Patriarch rise - Kirill, who has since been vehement in his crusade to amend the Fifth Article and grant the Church a prestigious status in the Russian republic. Now that Kerenskiy is gone and new people are in charge, he has officially petitioned the government to amend the Constitution and elevate the Church to the status of a state religion."
rusd.35.a:0 "Repeal Article 5."
rusd.35.b:0 "Russia shall stay secular!"
rusd.35.c:0 "The Church must have a role in the government"

rusd.36.t:0 "The Liberals Criticise the Clergy"
rusd.36.d:0 "It seems that the liberal elements of our society consider it rather unwise to maintain such strong bonds between the Church and the state. During a small demonstration in the capital, they have demanded more religious pluralism and secularisation of the government."
rusd.36.a:0 "Let them shout!"

rusd.37.t:0 "The Clergy criticises our Government"
rusd.37.d:0 "A number of priests have voiced their disagreement with our policy of a secular and modern state. Even though this fact has little importance, we must keep in mind that religion plays a huge role in common people's lives."
rusd.37.a:0 "Progress cannot be stopped!"

rusd.38.t:0 "The Patriarch criticises our Government"
rusd.38.d:0 "Seeing increased displeasure among the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state. Even if we try to turn a deaf ear on the clergy's demands, we cannot easily ignore a character so influential and powerful such as the patriarch."
rusd.38.a:0 "Everything shall stay as it is!"
rusd.38.b:0 "Encourage a national debate on religious matters."
rusd.38.c:0 "He is right, declare Orthodoxy our state religion!"
rusd.38.e:0 "Root out these narrow minded elements!"

rusd.40.t:0 "End the state of emergency"
rusd.40.d:0 "The political crisis is gone and it seems that all radical factions have been eliminated. Now it's time for snap presidential elections."
rusd.40.a:0 "Kerensky retires, KSR is dissolved."
rusd.40.b:0 "Kerensky stays."

rusd.41.t:0 "New Constitution"
rusd.41.d:0 "With the monarch in place we would need a new constitution which clearly outlines the amount of influence the monarch should have in comparison to the Senate and the Duma. This is a time of change and many voices wish to be heard."
rusd.41.a:0 "Adopt the Constitution of [GetYear]!"

rusd.42.t:0 "Imperial Benevolence"
rusd.42.d:0 "The idea of the Tsar being a feared tyrant is a thing of the past. Our Tsar is beloved and benevolent, like a stern but loving father who looks after us all."
rusd.42.a:0 "Long Live the Tsar!"

rusd.43.t:0 "Eurasianists in the Government?"
rusd.43.d:0 "The concept of Eurasianism, created by Nikolai Trubetzkoy and Pyotr Savitskiy, is very popular amongst Russian citizens. After the betrayal of Entente, the humiliation of Central Powers, we are very dissapointed with European powers. They have never seen us as equal, but perhaps we are not Europeans at all - as Eurasinists state. We might focus on cooperation with Asian powers instead and turn Europeans' back or we might still try to establish good relations with Entente."
rusd.43.a:0 "Invite Eurasianists into the government."
rusd.43.b:0 "Eurasianists are too eccentric. We are Europeans."

rusd.50.t:0 "Kornilov Consolidates His Rule"
rusd.50.d:0 "It has been a while since Lavr Kornilov and his loyal military generals have seized power in Russia. This week military junta has been consolidating its rule, destroying the opposition and purging socialists. Now it's time to reform the government to satisfy our needs."
rusd.50.a:0 "Russia has only two friends: army and fleet"

rusd.51.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
rusd.51.d:0 "The prime minister is one of the most important officials in the Russian Republic, who can define Russian internal policy. Currently, we have 4 candidates to choose. The first one is to leave Felix Yusupov, best friend of Dmitriy Pavlovich and current prime minister. THe second one is to choose Vasily Shulgin, leader of the VNS party, white general. The third one is to choose popular amongst conservatives Anton Denikin, a bit too authoritarian, but experienced general. The last choice is to elect the leader of the Natsional-Demokraty Faction, Nikolay Trubetzkoy, the least famous, but a prominent politician."
rusd.51.a:0 "Yusupov, President's Closest Friend."
rusd.51.b:0 "Vasily Shulgin, a Russian nationalist and monarchist."
rusd.51.c:0 "Marshall Denikin, Authoritarian Militarist."
rusd.51.e:0 "Mr. Trubetzkoy, National-Democrat."

rusd.53.t:0 "Forming Cabinet of Ministers"
rusd.53.d:0 "Kornilov has consolidated his junta, but to increase efficiency of his rule, he now should decide on a ministers' cabinet. Boris Savinkov, a former terrorist and socialist turned populist and nationalist and protector of the Russian peasants in the Duma, a talented writer, as well as the leader of the Combat Squads in the different Russian cities and towns, Savinkov is ready to accept the role of a Kornilov supporter and to start rebuilding the Russian society on the basis of his ideology of National Renewal. Another variant is Pyotr Wrangel, Kornilov's ROVS assistant. However, Kornilov is a popular and charismatic leader. The third way is to leave him as a head of government and prepare for taking on the mantle of the Supreme Ruler of Russia."
rusd.53.a:0 "Invite the Vozhd of the peasants into the government!"
rusd.53.b:0 "The Black Baron will lead the government"
rusd.53.e:0 "The Peasant Marshall will lead the government"
rusd.53.c:0 "Kornilov shall stay as head of government"

rusd.54.t:0 "Kornilov's Death"
rusd.54.d.savinkov:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Now nothing can stop Savinkov from merging posts of the president and the prime-minister and thus becoming unassailable in his leadership over Russia. The second variant is a military clique led by Denikin that will succeed Kornilov's junta in its core meaning."
rusd.54.d.denikin:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Two cliques are poised to seize control after Kornilov's passing. The first is led by the young officers of Baron Pyotr Wrangel. By no means a liberal, the Baron, however, knows that Russia must modernise and the societal issues of the state be resolved by a certain amount of governmental pragmatism. In opposition stands field marshal Anton Denikin, who favours continued authoritarian military rule solidified by strong traditionalism."
rusd.54.a:0 "Boris Savinkov merges the posts of president and prime-minister."
rusd.54.b:0 "Field marshal Denikin rallies the conservative officers!"
rusd.54.e:0 "Baron Wrangel succeeds him."
rusd.55.a:0 "Boris Savinkov and his combat squads capture power"
rusd.56.d:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief, one of the four officers that led the White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the civil war, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68.  Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."
rusd.56.a:0 "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more." 

rusd.57.t:0 "Kornilov is proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia"
rusd.57.d:0 "Lavr Kornilov has decided to maintain his leadership as a military dictator and today he was officially proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia."
rusd.57.a:0 "Kornilov is the new vozhd"

rusd.59.t:0 "Savinkov Addresses the Nation"
rusd.59.d:0 "Today new Russian prime-minister, Boris Savinkov, in his radio adress to the Russian people announced his dedication to defending Russia from external and internal enemies, who would try to take control over the country. He promised to deal with corruption inside the state apparatus, conduct land reform, improve labour legislation and provide further recovery of the state. It seems that order has finally returned to the country."
rusd.59.a:0 "We'll see"

rusd.60.t:0 "Directive No. 1"
rusd.60.d:0 "With the merger of the offices of president and prime minister, Boris Savinkov continued to solidify his grip over the Russian State by penning Directive No. 1 (also known as the first 'Prikaz Vozhdya'). Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'. Furthermore, the directive raised the Combat Squads to the status of a state organisation and a full-blown branch of the government."
rusd.60.a:0 "No shortage of hooks to hang the enemies of the state."

rusd.61.t:0 "Savinkov's address to the nation."
rusd.61.d:0 "Boris Savinkov, the closest associate of Supreme Ruler Kornilov, in his radio address to the Russian people announced his dedication to defending Russia from external and internal enemies, who would try to take control over the country. He promised to deal with corruption inside the state apparatus, conduct land reform, improve labour legislation and provide further recovery of the state. It seems that order has finally returned to the country."
rusd.61.a:0 "Finally..."

rusd.65.t:0 "Savinkov declared Vozhd"
rusd.65.d:0 "After the corruption crisis in the government, the NRPR majority in Duma has announced a new law to merge the posts of president and head of government. A national referendum also has been held with the 95% approval of Savinkov's obtaining both posts. Now nothing can stop Savinkov and his ambitions to create a centralised, strong Russia."
rusd.65.a:0 "Hail to the Vozhd!"

rusd.66.d.wrangel:0 "Wrangel has consolidated his power, but now it is time to decide the future of Russian politics. The first choice would be to give Kirill I his rightful place as Russian Tsar, which would restore the old absolute monarchy.

rusd.49.d:0 "The election of Shlyapnikov to the position of interim president seems to have caused negative repercussions. Much of the top military leadership have vocally spoke out against his premiership and it is alleged that privately, those generals both vocal and quiet of the situation have signalled that they would not intervene were the president to be deposed. Among the lower levels of the military there has been great unrest with reactionary agitation whipping the soldiers into an unruly frenzy."

rusd.125.d:0 "Maintenance of the democratic regime combined with the stable development of the state led to the emigration of some celebrities from syndicalist countries to Russia. This led, for example, to the arrival in Russia of the good friend of Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov, Coco Chanel.

rusd.126.t:0 "Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech"
rusd.126.d:0 "Germany's defeat at the hands of combined French and Russian arms some time ago has sent shockwaves across the world, and it has become apparent that this 'Second Weltkrieg' has changed the face of Europe for years to come. The continent has been divided between the Third Internationale and the Russian bloc, both of which wield enormous forces and have a bone to pick with the other side. And yet, neither of them have chosen to strike first, leaving the continent split in twain.\n\nThe Petrograd University in Russia has had the honour of hosting Sir Winston Churchill, a noted British statesman, writer, and former First Lord of the Admiralty of Britain. Speaking to the attending students, Churchill first made sure to note the great sacrifices which the Russian nation has made during the Second Weltkrieg, and assured that the British Empire and Russia shall always be natural allies in this new world order. The politician described Europe as a continent divided between two fundamentally different forces - one of liberty and one of Syndicalist terror, one of good and one of evil, and that an Iron Curtain divides them. He expresses his dismay that so much of Europe's heritage and famous cities now lie in the "French sphere", and hope that Russia and the Commonwealth can unite against this revolutionary threat.\n\nThough Churchill was not the first to express this idea, the striking imagery of his speech have set a new checkpoint in history. Europe, and with it, the world have been divided in a frozen conflict, one of ideological strife rather than power balance. It may only be solved via subversion, arms race and diplomacy...or a conflict far more destructive than the Second Weltkrieg."

rusd.139.t:0 "Reforming the Senate"
rusd.139.d:0 "The recent political crisis has shown the need for extensive reform of the governmental apparatus. The Senate is a useless talking shop, many officials are corrupt and local authorities conceal the real situation in their regions. All these problems should be solved as soon as possible. Our plan outlines creation of a power vertical, the Senate's powers will be restricted and a special control commission will be organised and integrated in the state apparatus."

rusd.140.t:0 "The New Duma?"
rusd.140.d:0 "After Savinkov's rise to power, the lower house of the Russian parliament - State Duma was dissolved. However some members of the Supreme Privy Council propose to reestablish this authority with the limited powers. Besides the People's Republican Party of Russia (NRPR) led by Savinkov, which will definitely have a majority, various business circles as well as the conservative groups and politicians also want to take part in the election, promising that they will support our new state policy, but they also want to represent their interests and help the government to strengthen the Russian economy as well as the army. Though their support can be important for Savinkov, but there is a chance that once they will try to take control over the country..."
rusd.140.a:0 "NRPR is strong, but needs connections in the elite. Start the elections!"
rusd.140.b:0 "We don't need any independent legislators as well as the State Duma itself."

rusd.141.t:0 "The New Duma is elected!"
rusd.141.d:0 "After the elections to the State Duma, Savinkov's NRPR got 73%. The conservative and right parties as well as the movements, led by the representatives of the Russian business and industry got other 27% of the votes.

rusd.143.d:0 "The very idea of liberalism, democracy, republicanism is a poison, that envenoms the lives of Russian citizens. We are an Orthodox state, led by our mighty Tsar and blessed by God. The distemper has pervaded the mind of Russians with the nonsense that they can rule themselves. The ones have overthrown the Tsar, the others have killed them. Everything has led to Revolution, Civil War, blood and vain 15 years of republican rule. But now it is time to end republicanism in Russia. We shall now protect the Russian monarchy once and for all."

rusd.144.d:0 "'Union of the perpetuation of the legacy of the Nikolay II' or just 'Union of Nikolay II' is an organisation, founded by the former tsarist officials such as Pyotr Bark and Vladimir Kokovtsov, who want to keep the remembrance of the last Russian tsar and his policy. They have proposed a program of the events to show the role of Nikolay II for the Russian people all over the country. The Senate pointed out that we should support this union to establish close connections with the former, but powerful officials. It should allow us to gain some votes of the conservative members of the local and state Dumas."
rusd.144.a:0 "We will remember Nikolay for all his good deeds for Russia."

rusd.145.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the [ROOT.GetLeader], who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. The President, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give [ROOT.GetLeader] the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nikolay II and president Kerenskiy didn't have. Nothing can stop the President from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"
rusd.145.a:0 "Long live the Aristocrats!"

rusd.146.t:0 "Endless Deadlock"
rusd.146.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov on the top of the Senate unfortunately couldn't stop the lasting crisis, which weakens Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago. It seems that Dmitriy Romanov has to fight for the support also against some of the senators."
rusd.146.a:0 "Oh well."

rusd.147.t:0 "NRPR Goes Bankrupt"
rusd.147.d:0 "Boris Savinkov's NRPR has seen a meteoric rise in popularity during the past few years. All the massive rallies they constantly hold and armed paramilitaries they own are not free, however. Hoping to break from obscurity as quickly as possible, Savinkov and the NRPR took loan after loan to fund their political campaigns, and they hoped that they would be able to write off all of their debts upon coming to power. This has not happened and the National Populist movement has found itself severely indebted, with no way to pay off their staff or workers, and popular support for them waning because of ongoing economic stabilization.\n\nSavinkov was forced to lay off campaigners, disband many of the party's branches, and significantly cut the size of the Combat Squads. His movement has started to splinter, the left wing has broken off and its leaders began blasting Savinkov in national newspapers, accusing him of running the NRPR as a clique of yesmen...all in all, it has not been a good year for them. Popular support for the NRPR has decayed, their rallies have ceased, and their deputies in the Duma have chosen to ally with the Octobrists and Eurasianists.\n\nIt appears that Savinkov's hopes of taking power in Russia have been dashed for good."
rusd.147.a:0 "And nobody shed a tear."

rusd.148.t:0 "New Aristocracy"
rusd.148.d:0 "Though the noblemen in the Senate could defeat this terrible republic and restore the Empire, but they had to admit that the support of the new capitalists and industrialists played the significant role in this restoration. That's why it is the perfect time to show them our gratitude - the most powerful representatives of these classes, who helped us to strengthen the power of the Senate will get a title of nobility, which their descendants will be able to get as well."

This saint woman, who was killed in 1918 by the Bolsheviks, was de-facto a stepmother of her nephew Dmitriy Pavlovich, who decided to perpetuate her good deeds by making a great contribution into the Convent."

Though Black Monday seriously hurt the factory, the growing power of the aristocracy and businessmen made the market of the luxury vehicles once again very profitable for ZIR. That's why the name 'Triumph' was suggested for the new limousine ZIR-101, which the plant started to produce at the beginning of 1937."

The document has got enough errors that it did not take a long time - soon, the President appeared before the Duma again, this time to announce his "New Course" (Noviy Kurs). Under this reform program to the Constitution, the powers of the State Duma have been limited for an indefinite duration of time, and while they remain the main legislative organ in the state, they now have to share their powers with the Senate, which has received the power of legislative initiative, as well as the ability to promulgate executive orders bypassing the Duma outright. As the Senate is far more loyal to the new president than the Duma ever was, it means that [ROOT.GetLeader] has gained a powerful tool at his disposal in order to reform the state to his whim."

With the republican reforms of Kerensky most of these schools were cancelled and all these students had to study together with the sons and daughters of the workers and peasants. The Senators claim that such elite gymnasiums should be restored to be sure that the best representatives of the next Russian generation will have perfect conditions for study. Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums…"

rusd.183.d:0 "Masquerade balls were widespread among the Russian nobles and students before the revolution in 1917. With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprising is that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."

rusd.184.t:0 "Mansions of the Aristocrats"
rusd.184.d:0 "The richest people of Russia, who are partially represented in the Senate could take back some of their mansions after the awful land redistribution in the Civil war, but they suffered a lot from the high land taxes of the Kerensky's regime. Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the policies of [ROOT.GetLeader]. There is a possible solution to this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."

After getting elected by the Senate, the Grand Duke declared it as his first intention to restore stability to the fallen nation - surprisingly, or perhaps not so, he made sure to omit any promises to support democracy in particular. Neither he nor the right-wing Senators who stand behind his back are all that thrilled with the democratic governance which the Left champions, although they're fine with paying lip service to it.\n\nThe people await the first actions of their new President."

Its political program calls for extensive political and social reform to maintain stability and prevent the growth of radical left wing forces, it is funded by several industrialist lobbies and supported by aristocrats.\n\nThe Conservative Bloc has thrown its full weight behind President [ROOT.GetLeader], granting him and his government a stable base of supporters in both houses of Parliament."

As long as they did not raise too much of a fuss, they were allowed to keep on living and doing their jobs. The extent to which Russia is rapidly being transformed to Savinkov's wishes intimidates them, as much as it did the socialists, and so they ultimately decided they had enough. Viktor Chernov, Pavel Milyukov and Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams have collectively drafted a manifesto in which they declared the formation of a Movement to Restore the Constitution and sent a demand to Savinkov to resign and allow free elections. \n\nSavinkov was not pleased, and the regime immediately moved against the democrats. A crackdown on democratic leaders has begun, numerous newspapers have been closed and their editors arrested, and the prisons overflowing with political arrests yet again.

They show how our Faith can bring order and stability to societies in this chaotic modern world. There are now a variety of political groups in neighbouring countries following a new form of politicised Orthodox Christianity. A loose organisation, calling itself 'Faith and Nation', has grown within Russia and is training activists and paramilitaries from these organisations, with the aim of developing their principles and forming an international brotherhood of Orthodox nations. While this could lead to international complications, it may provide an opportunity for Russia to acquire a firm position and role within the world once more."

russoc.3.d:0 "The RKP is the party of Bolsheviks that captured the power in the country in October 1917. Their unwillingness to cooperate with our socialist parties and trust in revolutionary terror has detonated the Civil War. After the Civil War, the Bolsheviks were almost dissolved. Some left for France, the others, like Nikolay Bukharin and Aleksey Rykov founded their own party. Since then the party was ruled by Grigory Zinoviev, a talented orator, but a radical, who believes that only by dictatorship true socialism can be achieved. While his methods seem too radical for us now, we can agree on their participation in the congress only if Lev Kamenev, a more moderate candidate will become their representative and leader, if they succeed.\n\nThe decisions to invite the RKP was greatly criticized by Left SR delegates, who are natural enemies of the Bolsheviks since the July Uprising in 1918."

However, [SOV.GetNameDef] will need time to stabilize the country, a time we must use to extend our protection to any countries endangered by the new regime.\n\nPoland, Finland and the Caucasus all stand unprotected - we must do whatever we can to protect them, lest they fall to the incoming Russians."

russoc.106.d:0 "The government's program of mass collectivization, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialize in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the program of collectivization to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destablized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."
russoc.106.a:0 "We will have to educate the farmers on the superiority of collectivization"

russoc.108.d:0 "A truly socialist courtyard game has become popular among children, the game in question being called 'Reds and Whites', a truly socialist form of Cowboys and Indians, where the Cowboys are the Reds and the Indians the Whites. The game has become so popular in fact that companies have begun to sell air-guns explicitly for Reds and Whites, with those guns being very popular among children too. The government has strongly supported this, seeing it as a way to mould the youth to be more open to Socialism even in the future."
russoc.108.a:0 "Children are like soft wax"

russoc.109.t:0 "Change in Family Rules Result in Spike in Divorce Rates"
russoc.109.d:0 "While many revolutionaries had a religious background or learned at religious schools, they do not have a good opinion on the Church in general, seeking to break the Orthodox Church and its influence on the Russian society both legally and through their public influence. However, while curbing their cultural influence will take out longer, the government has begun eroding the influence of the Orthodox Church legally.\n\nThe [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has begun measures to take away the control and forming of marriages away from the Church and making it a civil affair of the government, they also greatly simplified divorce, where it is now a simple matter of registration, instead of the former hard process in Tsarist and Republican Russia.\n\nHowever, while this has greatly improved the mobility of women to leave abusive families, it also resulted in a massive spike of divorce rates on a level never seen before, with the divorce rate being the highest in the world now, thanks to divorce being this easy now."
russoc.109.a:0 "An unforeseen consequence for sure"

russoc.110.t:0 "Begin of Latinization of Languages"
russoc.110.d:0 "As socialism seeks to unite humanity and wither away states in the future, many in the government have proposed that the [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government should begin Latinising the languages in its nations, as the Cyrillic alphabet would impend communication between Western Europe and Russia and the people compromising it, among others. However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the amount of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the land compromising this nations. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoliy Lunacharskiy, who is known for his more unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious groups."

russoc.111.t:0 "Formation of the Young Pioneers"
russoc.111.d:0 "The Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization has recently been founded, after a long conflict between the Komsomol and the scout movement was decided in the favour of the scout movement, who wanted an independent organization, while Konsomol wanted to keep them integrated into the organization, being helped by the widow of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya, who supported the cause of the scout movement against Komsomol.\n\nThe intent of the young pioneers is to further integrate the youth into the state machinery, swearing an oath to 'to stand firmly for the cause of our Communist Party.' While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organization, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the young pioneers.\n\nThe routine of the young pioneers consist out of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs; which has given the young pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as it gives many in the youth, who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."

Dominated by the White generals of the Russian Civil War, the Russian Army is not the best place to be for the so-called 'new guard', officers and commanders who enrolled in the Russian army after the Civil War. They were barred from numerous prestigious positions and would often struggle to advance in their career. The decay of order in the country and the growth of socialism left many of them sympathizing with their cause, and now, with the Second Civil War going ahead, they have defected from their ranks and switched their sides to the Bolshevik mobs in Moscow.\n\nImmediately, these traitors have all been tried to death in absentia and will certainly receive due punishment after our victory."

Soon after, however, he resigned his post and joined Denikin's Armed Forces of South Russia, saying that he will not serve the German occupation. However, there are rumours that Wrangel, from the family of Baltic German origin, can be secretely a German spy that has been delivering data to the German intelligence.

rusd.214.t:0 "Denikin Delivers Speech"
rusd.214.d:0 "Denikin has publicly delivered the speech to explain what had happened during the Civil War. He said that these were not pogroms, but terror against Bolshevik partisans. He added that it is not a secret that many Bolsheviks were Jews, so the actions were anti-Bolshevist and helped to win the war. He also added that he signed the decree banning Jews from joining the Russian Army because of existing anti-Semitic moods in the army, and not because of his own personal views.

russia.442.d:0 "Pavel Gorgulov - the Green Vozhd and the reborn Son of the Skythians - has led our peasant armies and the Green Legion to victory after triumphant victory, conquering all the lands of Old Skythia and beyond under the unstoppable tide of our forces. Always a true believer in the storied tradition of the Old Skythians, it is no secret that Gorgulov has modeled much of the new Russian culture on exaggerated accounts of Skythian history, but now he could take it one step further. With the old nomadic lands of the Geloni, the Saka, the Budini, the Androphagi, and all the other Skythian tribes from antiquity all being consolidated into our national fabric by Gorgulov’s hand, there is no one in the way to stop him should he decide to take this fascination even further. \n\nSure, we could go on living in our new Russian Peasant's State, continuing to live our simple Russian lives according to our long, tedious, yet stoic Russian history and culture, but why settle for being mere Russians when we could be Skythian! If we were to indulge Gorgulov’s ‘appreciation’ for Skythian culture, we could finally push the mildly unhinged Green Vozhd to lose all inhibition and fully begin to reform our nation into the reincarnation of the Great Skythia of antiquity! As if we lept from the pages of history and Herodotus’ writings, Skythia can be reborn if we so will it. The noble nomadic warrior culture of these long-lost demigods does not have to be lost, for we can bring it back to life here in our newly consolidated nation. What course shall the Green Vozhd Gorgulov take us on at this all-important crossroads?"
russia.442.a:0 "Like Koloksai and Palacus before him, Gorgulov too shall rise to rule Skythia!"

The issue arises in the fact that the old Skythia never truly had a national flag. However, inspired by the art of the era, Gorgulov has been presented with the choice of two flags - both representing the same iconic deer with the “looped” antlers. The question remains, what colour pattern shall the nation use for this design?"

russia.2006.t:0 "City on Neva"
russia.2006.d:0 "Now that we have decided to revive the monarchy in Russia, there are still reminders of the revolutionary year of 1917. Some geographical features still praise the revolution, while others that were named after symbols of our great country lost their original names after the revolution. If we want the Second Russian Empire to be a worthy successor to the first, we need to erase the reminder of the revolution."
russia.2006.a:0 "We need to return the historical name to the Peter's city!"
russia.2006.b:0 "Germany is still our enemy, Petrograd sounds more Patriotic."

russia.2008.t:0 "Kerensky's Legacy"
russia.2008.d:0 "As part of the Kerensky reforms in the 20s, many cities were renamed, the names of some bore reminders of the monarchical past of Russia, others were called in the German manner, the worst enemy of Russia, because of which the great changes of the last 20 years took place. Now that Kerensky's identity is considered highly controversial, as is his politics, it may be time to restore the old names of these cities under which they saw the glorious times in the history of our motherland, under new names they experienced only the instability and crises of the young Russian democracy."
russia.2008.a:0 "Let's return to the reflection of the glorious times."
russia.2008.b:0 "Kerensky brought democracy to Russia, and his cause will live on."

russia.2009.t:0 "Window to Europe"
russia.2009.d:0 "Now that the Baltic States were handed over to the Germans as a result of the shameful Brest peace, the question of local place names has arisen-should we return the pre-revolutionary Russian names to localities, or would it be better to leave it to the discretion of local residents, who in other matters have always called their cities and villages in the local manner?"
russia.2009.a:0 "This land of ours will be called in our own way."
russia.2009.b:0 "We will leave their national names."

russia.2010.t:0 "Our Shame Is Avenged"
russia.2010.d:0 "What we have been waiting for for the last twenty years has happened, we have washed away the shame of the Great War by defeating Germany. We now control East Prussia, centered on the city of Kenegsberg, the cradle of the German Empire. Now we need to decide the fate of the city: whether we should leave it a German name, or whether it should be renamed Krolevets, as it was called by our ancestors, the Slavs who lived in Prussia before the Germans. Some patriots would like to give the city a new name-in honor of the great figures who raised Russia from its knees, some are in favor of remembering the glorious victories of the Seven Years' War in the new name. The choice is ours."
russia.2010.a:0 "There's no point in changing the name let's be merciful to the losers."
russia.2010.b:0 "Let's show that we are the heirs of the Slavs, the new name is Korolevets."

russia.2012.d:0 "Almost two hundred years ago, during the Seven Years ' War, our valiant troops completely captured the territories of East Prussia, and were also able to take the heart of Germany-Berlin, but the shame of the House of Romanov-Emperor Peter 3 refused all conquests and returned all the territories we conquered. Now you are back in control of Prussian land and must honor the memory of the Russian soldiers by renaming the heart of Prussia."
russia.2012.a:0 "We will perpetuate the name of the mother-Empress Elizabeth Petrovna."
russia.2012.b:0 "The city will bear the name of Apraksin, who brought victories to Russia on the fields of Prussia."

russia.2012.e:0 "Other variants seem more legit."

russia.144.d:0 "After the February Revolution and the fall of the Russian Empire administration started pursuing de-tsarification of various historical cities, especially in city names, a prominent example being Romanov-na-Murmane.
