### Focuses ###
GRU_breitspurbahnen:0 "Breitspurbahnen"
GRU_breitspurbahnen_desc:0 "While the Old Empire did little for us and for the German worker, at the very least it's undeniable it had done wonders to improve its infrastructure. However the Kaiser as usual had not done enough. Today we are beginning work on a grand and ambitious program, the Breitspurbahnen or Double Gauge Railway, which will link the cities of our nation with large gauge railways carrying our noble citizens on grand Hotels of the Rails, the double decker railroad coaches. It will be a time consuming project as much of the existing railway has to be torn up as well to be remade to fit with our new ones, but the time taken will be earned back ten fold by the speed and safety we will achieve on our new rails."
GRU_welfare:0 "People's Welfare"
GRU_welfare_desc:0 "The Kaiser served not the worker but the Junker nobility who did nothing but oppress us! This was perfectly demonstrated with his not only inability to do anything to alleviate our suffering during Black Monday, but also his outright refusal to do so! Now with the worker in power we will remedy his mistakes! We shall institute a generous welfare program to alleviate the plight of the common man using funds seized from the decadent Junkers."
GRU_staatsfeind_nr1:0 "Staatsfeind Nr.1"
GRU_staatsfeind_nr1_desc:0 "'They lay among us, everywhere these inventors and propagators of Judeo-Capitalism. These Jewish snakes lie in the bush, controlling the Bankers both abroad and even at home, awaiting the perfect time to strike our workers' paradise and pull us back into their degenerate hands!'\nIn a recent speech Volksfuhrer Joseph Goebbels has lashed out at the Bankers both foreign and domestic. He has declared them Staatsfiend No 1, Public Enemy Number 1, and ordered the Army to round up any remaining bankers still hiding out in German borders, Jewish or not, and to seize what few private banks have remained open in the government’s blind spots."
GRU_germany_reborn:0 "Germany Reborn"
GRU_germany_reborn_desc:0 "Through hard work, grit and determination we have built a new Germany on the ashes of the old. Many thought that building a workers utopia by carving out the heart of reaction was impossible, much less that it would last as long as it has. However we have proven them wrong and we stand poised to bring our new German revolution to the whole world!"
GRU_form_the_guard:0 "Form the KdV"
GRU_form_the_guard_desc:0 "While the Army is certainly a vanguard of the Revolution, historically the military has also been a haven for reactionary elements. Look to one of innumerable military coups through history to show that the Army can be both our greatest strength and our most fierce enemy. To safeguard our revolution with a truly revolutionary military organ, we shall form the Peoples Guard Corps, the KdV, to defend the Revolution. They will get the best training and equipment our state can provide and are charged with protecting the revolution from all domestic enemies while guarding the state itself. Some say the KdV is just a National-Marxist terrorist squads given a new name, but they usually dont say stuff like that after a visit from them."
GRU_kulturkampf:0 "Kulturkampf"
GRU_kulturkampf_desc:0 "The Church and other organizations associated with it are deeply ingrained into German society. This has given them a degree of power that we find unacceptable, especially since the Church denies our legitimacy. However, now we feel secure enough to go after the Church. Dissident priests will be replaced, iconography will be destroyed and a new 'Holy Book', Das Kapital will be distributed instead of the Bible. This new Church of the Worker will have no hierarchy and will harbor no ill will to the State. Now not only have we saved the worker in the physical realm but also in the spiritual as well."
GRU_first_congress_of_german_unions:0 "First Congress of German Unions"
GRU_first_congress_of_german_unions_desc:0 "Today the National People's Union of Germany, the big tent coalition of Syndicalist and left leaning groups and unions that led the Revolution, has collapsed. With all its factions pulling it in radically different directions at the same time, it was only a wonder that it survived as long as it has. To prevent the nation from falling into anarchy the Government has called the First Congress of the German Unions to hash out the factions' differences and see which one will lead us into the future."
GRU_iva:0 "I.v.A."
GRU_iva_desc:0 "To begin the process of breaking down the old bourgeois order and building a new and equitable system, we shall start the Industrie Verstaatlichung Aktion, or I.v.A. to begin nationalizing the factories that dot our nation. In some areas like the Ruhr, where our Revolution began, this will be only a formality as workers unions seized their workspaces ages ago. However, in more conservative areas like Bavaria we might have to resort to force to detach the old order from their wealth."
GRU_rva:0 "R.v.A."
GRU_rva_desc:0 "To secure the foundation of our national prosperity the Government has begun the Ressourcen Verstaatlichung Aktion, or R.v.A, to seize the mines, saw mills and other raw resource producers for the greater good. This will be markedly easier than going straight after the factories as many of the blue collar labourers who made up the bulk of our Revolution worked in these areas. All it will be for the most part is putting a bureaucrat there to help the locals integrate more into the national economy."
GRU_found_the_fdj:0 "Found the FDJ"
GRU_found_the_fdj_desc:0 "If Germany is to survive the coming trials we must forge the Germans anew. The past decades of prosperity have made our people fat and lazy and decadent. This generation is long gone, having only barely come back into the light soon enough to retire and die. The next generation however is still able to be saved from themselves. To do this Goebbels has created the Freie Deutsche Jugend, or the Free German Youth which is an organization which promotes healthy living, Nationalist and Socialist values, and military discipline. The FDJ will also be compulsory so we can be sure all of Germany’s children will receive the right teaching."
GRU_nationalize_ufa:0 "Nationalize UFA"
GRU_nationalize_ufa_desc:0 "Goebbels has a talent for speaking. It was his speeches to the masses and to the Congress that got him his job. Now, with himself having complete control, he shall seek to be sure all will hear his voice. To do this UFA, the largest media conglomerate in Germany, shall be nationalized. Before now its reluctant cooperation with the Government has been tolerated, but no more. WIth the UFA under government control it will become yet another arm of Government propaganda to show the German people the real truths of the world, just as Goebbels sees them."
GRU_faud_victory:0 "FAUD Victory"
GRU_faud_victory_desc:0 "During the First Congress the Free Workers Union of Germany, the Anarchists, have managed to take control. Promising nigh unlimited freedoms and complete liberation of the worker they have managed to secure their hold on the reigns of power. Its many critics describe them as anti-State Statists with all the contradictions and hypocrisy such a label brings. We will prove them wrong."
GRU_sepd_victory:0 "SMEPD Victory"
GRU_sepd_victory_desc:0 "After all the debating, shouting and accusing has come to an end we have elected the SMEPD, the remnants of the Big Tent coalition that once ruled the nation, has secured victory. While not totally unexpected an a continuation of the old powers, they still have many challenges ahead fo them. Germany still reels from the War, the economy is in tatters and already the party is breaking into factions. All that remains is to see which one will lead us into our glorious victory."
GRU_nmdvp_victory:0 "NMDVP Victory"
GRU_nmdvp_victory_desc:0 "In a massive shock, Joseph Goebbels and his minority NMDVP has won out during the Congress. Electrifying delegates and the public alike with his fiery speeches he has done the seemingly impossible. Promising a National Renewal among Nationalist and Syndicalist lines his victory is seen as a victory for the extremists within our nation. His few supporters rejoice in the streets while the rest of the nation, and the world, looks on anxiously and wonders what this firebrand will do next."
GRU_kommandowirtschaft:0 "Kommandowirtschaft"
GRU_kommandowirtschaft_desc:0 "To leave the economy up to the individual is short sighted and inefficient. People are only out to help themselves and either do not or refuse to see the bigger picture. The Government must have total control over the economy because only the Government can see the bigger picture and also care for everybody. To do this we have established the Kommandowirtschaft, the Command Economy which will set up special 'Command Bureaus' to run sections of the economy according to Government orders."
GRU_form_the_stasi:0 "Form the Stasi"
GRU_form_the_stasi_desc:0 "During the time of the old Empire the Abwher was the most powerful intelligence organization under the sun. It kept tabs on all dissidents within Germany while maintaining an extensive foreign spy network. We must surpass this legacy if we are to be truly secure. Our new intelligence agency, the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit or more simply, The Stasi, will be charged with keeping tabs on all citizens both foreign and domestic while maintaining complete visibility over our future enemies abroad. By casting such a wide net, no enemy of the state or Revolution will go unnoticed."
GRU_gleichschaltung:0 "Gleichschaltung"
GRU_gleichschaltung_desc:0 "The Gleichschaltung, or Coordination, will bring all aspects of civil and social life into line with the Party and with Goebbels. There are still many miscellaneous organizations which have escaped our consolidation ranging from medical charities that receive government funding to more major government agencies. With this new law all of them will be brought closer to the government and therefore are easier to control."
GRU_volksfuhrer:0 "Hail the Volksführer"
GRU_volksfuhrer_desc:0 "The time is right to take the final move to consolidate our power. Our Revolution is under constant assault from malicious outside actors and devilish fifth columns within our own nation. If we are to stand against them and save the people from oppression we must stand united. With the new Volksfuhrer-Erlass we will consolidate the positions of Head of State, Head of Government and Commander in Chief into one position, the Volksfuhrer. This position will obviously be held by Goebbels, the leader of our nation and the singular Vanguard of the German Revolution!"
GRU_anhaltelager:0 "Anhaltelager"
GRU_anhaltelager_desc:0 "As the list of dissidents and enemies of the people grows longer the number of people filling our prisons has reached crisis levels. What's worse is that a significant majority of these people have never had a single day in court which has drawn criticism from some. However, to let all these scum back onto the streets would only beg for disaster. To remedy this problem Goebbels had demanded the creation of a network of Anhaltelager, extrajudicial prison camps to hold these vermin until they can be processed. Just how we are to process them will require another, final, solution but we can think of that later."
GRU_night_of_the:0 "Night of the........"
GRU_night_of_the_desc:0 "Despite our great strides to consolidate the state under our leadership we still have to contend with pockets of internal dissent largely focused around remaining Congress leaders. We must deal with them and tighten our grip on the reigns of power."
GRU_spd_victory:0 "SPD-R Victory"
GRU_spd_victory_desc:0 "After much debate the SPD-R has emerged victorious. Led by Karl Liebknekt it promises Syndicalist democracy for all along with a radical expansion of rights. This has been met with derision and anger from the more radical aspects of our new nation but for the most part the people seem to support the new administration. Having only tasted autocracy for its history the German people are ready for true democracy to light a torch of freedom for all of Europe and the World to follow."
GRU_thalmann:0 "Thälmann"
GRU_thalmann_desc:0 "After a short power struggle within the SMPED the traditional Syndicalists have managed to beat out the old school Bolsheviks. As a radical departure from the Kaiser its expected that the new Chairman will have a lot of work to do. Ahead of him Thalmann will have to build a new society built of equity for the worker and equality for all where once strict stratification and autocracy ruled. With help from across the border and with preservation however its inevitable the Workers Dream will come to Germany."
GRU_deutsche_syndikalisiische_republik:0 "Deutsche Syndikalistische Republik"
GRU_deutsche_syndikalisiische_republik_desc:0 "Up until now we have still maintained our declaration of an Emergency Socialist Government. However with the Revolution over and our power secured its finally time to do away with the temporary faucets of our government and build a new, Syndicalist state with a new Constitution and radically new laws to reflect our new values."
GRU_syndicalist_education:0 "Syndicalist Education"
GRU_syndicalist_education_desc:0 "The old education system was built to uphold a system of oppression and degradation for the masses. If we are to liberate not only the present but the future we must retool our ancient education system to teach the values of equality, liberation and solidarity with our children’s comrades."
GRU_pieck:0 "Pieck"
GRU_pieck_desc:0 "After a short power struggle in SMEPD the Old Bolsheviks have emerged victorious over the Classic Syndicalists. Loyal to the ideals of Lenin and the failed Russian Revolution they aim to do what Lenin could not and create a dictatorship of the proletariat in Germany. All will be equal and the Bolsheviks can once more become the vanguard of the Revolution like they were before the disgrace in Russia."
GRU_one_union:0 "One Union"
GRU_one_union_desc:0 "German trade unions are currently a mish mash of varying and sometimes competing organizations. Their incessant feuding has become a running joke among rightists as “the only thing a Union man hates more than a capitalist is another Union man”. To remedy this problem we will reorganize all of Germany’s unions along a new and strict regimen. United in structure and purpose they can stand together as a bulwark against counterrevolution."
GRU_integration:0 "Integration"
GRU_integration_desc:0 "In our new Germany there will be a place for all, none should be without work. Some economists say this is literally impossible and if possible, bad for the economy but we will show them wrong. We shall send agents out across Germany to establish permanent (and compulsory for the unemployed) job fairs so all those without jobs will get them. Once we are out of jobs, we will simply carve niches out of existing positions to make new jobs for the rest of them."
GRU_free_universities:0 "Syndicalist Universities"
GRU_free_universities_desc:0 "Education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don’t need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. Competition for the best teachers should be fierce; they should be making six figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for the government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. In the Old Germany a university education was out of the question for the vast majority of people. Those who got said education formed an upper crust of lower society which kept the proletariat uneducated and subdued. In our new Germany all universities will be public and will be free! If a man or woman wants to learn about the world he inhabits there should be no barriers to his or her pursuit of that knowledge."
GRU_fortschritt:0 "Fortschritt!"
GRU_fortschritt_desc:0 "Our old nation was build on conservatism and reaction. Our new nation is a vanguard of progressivism! We have already done so much but there is still much more to do! Vorwärts, Genossen! In unsere neue und größere Zukunft!"
GRU_mfsp:0 "MfSP"
GRU_mfsp_desc:0 "The newly established Ministry of Special Projects has been founded to utilize the greatest minds of our country to keep us on the frontiers of civil and military sciences. Some of these bright minds have voiced concerns about our proposed projects and the destructive power they could entail, but they should shut up! We know that if we don’t create these inventions then someone else will and use them against us!."
GRU_neue_schwerindustrie:0 "Neue Schwerindustrie"
GRU_neue_schwerindustrie_desc:0 "Germany is the industrial heartland of Europe. Our factories are the greatest on the Continent and even rival or surpass the titans of America and Russia in efficiency. However our leaders have big plans for Germany’s future and if they are to achieve them then we must reach ever greater heights. That is why the government has aided our biggest factories in expanding even more while founding many more new factories across the nation."
GRU_spzproj_uran:0 "Spz.Proj. URAN"
GRU_spzproj_uran_desc:0 "Special Projekt URAN, led by Walter Gerlach, is the project aiming to use fissionable materials like uranium to create new sources of power. Another avenue is the creation of a long theorized uranium bomb which scientists predict could level entire cities with just one bomb. If their predictions are true then we must get this weapon before our enemies do. Who can resist us if our words are backed by nuclear weapons!"
GRU_spzprojpfeil:0 "Spz.Proj.PFEIL"
GRU_spzprojpfeil_desc:0 "Special Projekt PFEIL, named after the German word for arrow, is a top secret development project headed by Walther von Braun to create long range ballistic weapons. Dr von Braun has been petitioning the government for funding for a project like this since the Kaiser sat on his throne. Now with all the money he could want he assures us he will have a working V-1 Rocket ready within a few years at most. Von Braun himself aims for space though, we shall however aim for our enemies."
GRU_industrial_unionisation:0 "Industrial Unionization"
GRU_industrial_unionisation_desc:0 "In a move that has frankly taken too long to go through with, we shall nationalize all industries and hand their day to day operations to various unions across the nation. Following through on as basic a promise as this will be rather easy but will buy us miles of public sympathy from workers who have been alienated from their work for decades."
GRU_ressource_redistribution:0 "Resource Re-Distribution"
GRU_ressource_redistribution_desc:0 "To aid in the maximization of our resources we shall nationalize all our lands resources. Then we can organize them and efficiently distribute them across our nation as needed. This will keep some areas from hoarding vital resources while others starve and bring about a new age of efficiency within our industry."
GRU_union_trade_committee:0 "Union Trade Committee"
GRU_union_trade_committee_desc:0 "In accordance with the recently passed Law on the Organization of National Trade Unions a new Union Trade Committee will be founded. Led by a council of seven members it will mediate disputes between unions and upon the government's behest can assume leadership of all unions in Germany to better coordinate with the government in times of crisis."
GRU_agrarian_collectives:0 "Agrarian Communes"
GRU_agrarian_collectives_desc:0 "Much of the Junkers' money was found in land. They held vast estates with farms stretching over the horizon. Today these decrepit estates shall be broken up and handed over to local Agrarian Communes who can more easily administer their own land. Run and used by the locals it will also inspire a sense of pride and accomplishment as much of their own harvest will be left with them after the Government's quota."
GRU_artisan_communes:0 "Artisan Communes"
GRU_artisan_communes_desc:0 "Not even the arts can escape democratization. The elitist artistic world will be broken down and remade into a series of Artisan Communes where everything from the tools they use to the art they make will be the property of the Commune and the Country and for all to see. Government stipends and individual donations will keep these communes solvent as selling art deprives it from the proletariat."
GRU_einigkeit_recht:0 "Einigkeit, Recht....."
GRU_einigkeit_recht_desc:0 "The first two principles our new nation will be founded on are unity, the unification of the German people under the red banner of Syndicalism and Justice, the equalization of a long held discriminatory justice system. Now not only could the average citizen see his work affect the prosperity of his community and nation but now he knows that any wrongs against him will be solved through the justice system and restore some of his lost faith in the government who has long turned his back on him."
GRU_woman_suffrage:0 "Woman Suffrage"
GRU_woman_suffrage_desc:0 "In most of the world, and even Germany before our Revolution, women were treated as less than people. They were simply servants you can lay with and will have your children. This is a deeply misogynistic world view and completely against the views of our new Germany. As one of our first decrees since taking power, giving basic rights to women shows the world and the people just how committed to equality we are."
GRU_liberal_education:0 "Liberal Education"
GRU_liberal_education_desc:0 "The national education system is a mess and tries to hammer into our next generation that the deeply flawed system we overthrew was just and right and natural. All of this was sometimes done in lieu of actual education. More radical Congress members want to indoctrinate our kids like the Empire did, just into the correct system this time. However, we know to sink to their level will show us as no better than the oppressors we overthrew. Instead we will strip all political and religious themes from our education system and focus solely on the sciences."
GRU_higher_education_grants:0 "Higher Education Grants"
GRU_higher_education_grants_desc:0 "Intelligence does not restrict itself to those able to more able to afford to use it. We will establish government grants to allow the smartest of our poorer class to reach the highest levels of education for the benefit of the nation as a whole. WIth new opportunities the poorest among us can break the cycle of poverty and raise their new families from the squalor they suffered in."
GRU_antidiscriminatory_laws:0 "Anti-Discriminatory Laws"
GRU_antidiscriminatory_laws_desc:0 "Bigotry is a poison spreading through all societies of the world and even within our movement, not anymore, we will make sure to eradicate all traces of it wherever it hides. All minorities, whether ethnic, religious or sexual, will see their right defended above all else, our new anarchist society will not accept any form of discrimination against anyone."
GRU_antiauthoritarian_education:0 "Anti-Authoritarian Education"
GRU_antiauthoritarian_education_desc:0 "Children are all unique. To shove them all in a room for eight hours a day and expect all of them to listen as a teacher drones on is foolish. Instead our leaders have found truth in the words of educator Maria Montessori, who believes in free thinking and self correction for students. We shall invite her to Berlin to help us form our new education system. Be it outside, hands on learning for the more physical amongst them or using the latest technology to ensnare their active imaginations in the vivid pictures of history we will grant our teachers the tools necessary to make our next generation the most educated in history."
GRU_communal_universities:0 "University Communes"
GRU_communal_universities_desc:0 "The classic interpretation of a University is way too rigid for our new Germany. Instead the university system will be replaced with an ecosystem of University Communes where students will not only receive the best education in Europe but will meet and converse with their peers and form bonds that will last the rest of their lives."
GRU_humane_pensions:0 "Humane Pensions"
GRU_humane_pensions_desc:0 "Our aging generation risked it all to form this new and free world. They have done the impossible and turned a world of backwards reaction and close mindedness into one where the worker walks freely and equally with even the highest government officials. For their sacrifices they must be rewarded in their much earned retirement. A new pension will be established for all retirees within our nation over the age of 65. It has been described as generous into excess but it is the least we could do for the Greatest Generation."
GRU_und_freiheit:0 "....und Freiheit"
GRU_und_freiheit_desc:0 "Freedom. Seven letters with a titanic amount of meaning. As the last of the four principles it is the most important. Our people will be free from oppression, free from want, free from need. Free from the horrors of war and free from the horrors of poverty. Free from discrimination at home and free from loss. The German people have finally tasted true and purely unfiltered Freedom and have grown to desire it. We would all rather die, down to the last man, woman and child, rather than give it up to another tyrant!"
GRU_socialmarket_economics:0 "Social-Market Economics"
GRU_socialmarket_economics_desc:0 "To continue the capitalistic economy under the Kaiser would be abetting in oppression. However, we acknowledge that those who worked hard under the previous system deserve to keep what they clawed from the bourgeois’s greedy hands. To take that away from them would wipe away any want or ambition in our people. To remedy this problem we have begun to build a new Social-Market Economy where private ownership is allowed but major industries are nationalized. Some denounce this is as capitalist oppression in red paint, but the results will speak for themselves."
GRU_worker_rights:0 "Worker Rights"
GRU_worker_rights_desc:0 "Without rights the Worker is just a slave. Their bosses would much rather they become slaves as that would lead to greater profits. However, as a modern and progressive society we cannot allow such barbarity. We shall spell out and enshrine workers rights to fair wages and to organize and create a new organization, Abteilung für Arbeitssicherheit, to oversee that these rights are never to be infringed. The AfA will have the power to close down offending businesses and levy steep fines against offending bosses. With this new power the boss will be forced to work with their workers and not lord over them."
GRU_support_startups:0 "Support Startups"
GRU_support_startups_desc:0 "Small businesses are the backbone of a modern economy, Syndicalist or not. To restore our nation's shattered economy we will start giving promising startups generous government grants to kickstart the economic recovery our people have been pleading for for so long."
GRU_german_industrial_miracle:0 "German Industrial Miracle"
GRU_german_industrial_miracle_desc:0 "Numbers don't lie and the numbers show that not only have we recovered from Black Monday but we have even begun to surpass economic output before the crash! This would’ve been impossible if we leaned too hard towards Syndicalism or turned to straightforward Capitalism. It's only the genius of our economic planning and collaboration with private sectors that we achieved such prosperity! We have saved Germany!."
GRU_return_to_the_worldstage:0 "Return to the World Stage"
GRU_return_to_the_worldstage_desc:0 "Now that we have solidified our rule at home and fixed our broken economy we can turn to our foreign ambitions. Germany before the Revolution was a world leader. While it was a world leader in oppression and reactionary violence, its power was undeniable and irresistible. We must take up its mantle as a world power, but now it will be in support of the Revolution and not fighting against it."
GRU_formation_of_the_nva:0 "Formation of the NVA"
GRU_formation_of_the_nva_desc:0 "Now that our industry is humming along at sufficient capacity we can turn to reorganizing our military into the National Volksarmee with three planned branches, the Nationale Volksmarine or the Navy, the Nationale Luftwaffe or Air Force and the Nationales Volksheer or the Army. This new NVA will be more modern and more effective than the old Imperial military could ever have been. They will be the defenders of the revolution at home and even abroad!"
GRU_nationales_volksheer:0 "Nationales Volksheer"
GRU_nationales_volksheer_desc:0 "The Nationales Volksheer is to be the land arm of our military. Its organization is still up to some debate but what is not up to debate is the primacy of the Volksheer in our new military. What we call our ‘army’ now is little more than a grouping of ragtag militia who have elected to not disband after the Civil War. It will take tremendous effort and more importantly, money to turn these militia into a professional and disciplined fighting force. However it must be done if our state is to be secure."
GRU_nationale_volksmarine:0 "Nationale Volksmarine"
GRU_nationale_volksmarine_desc:0 "The National Volksmarine is the naval branch of our new military. We received a few ships during the Civil War but they are still being run by a cobbled together hierarchy of sailors communes and self-administering ships. The ships themselves are also falling further behind in technology. Any respectable nation has a navy, and a great power like us must have a grand navy to rival all others if our seas are to be safe from foreign incursion."
GRU_nationale_luftwaffe:0 "Nationale Luftwaffe"
GRU_nationale_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Nationale Luftwaffe will be the air force of our military. As the newest of our independent branches of the military this one will be the easiest to restructure. While the Army and Navy have centuries of tradition to uproot and turn almost entirely on its head, the Luftwaffe has only been around a few decades. The old Luftstriekcrafte is dead and from its ashes a new Luftwaffe will rise, proud and most importantly, Red."
GRU_skilled_officers:0 "Skilled Officers"
GRU_skilled_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. One camp argues that we must pursue the most skilled officers within our nation. Unfortunately many of the most skilled officers remaining in our nation are former Imperial officers. These men fought in Africa against the Mau Mau, against the Viet Minh in Indochina, or even in the Weltkrieg itself. Some worry that giving these men who gave their lives to the Kaiser power within our military would only invite counterrevolution. However, this is a risk we must take to make our military more effective."
GRU_elected_officers:0 "Elected Officers"
GRU_elected_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. Some have argued for us to not recruit officers for our soldiers. Instead we should allow our units to elect their own officers from within. These men would undoubtedly inspire loyalty within our units to their commanders and their country. These officers would be only minorly reviewed and as such presents one major problem. It's always a risk that our noble soldiers would just elect a slacker or a ‘good ol boy’ who wouldn’t discipline the troops as well. They could elect bad officers who don’t know how to lead. However this is a risk worth taking to placate our soldiers and show just how democratic our state is."
GRU_political_officers:0 "Political Officers"
GRU_political_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. A vocal part of our military argues for political officers, chosen for their loyalty rather than their credentials as an officer necessarily. They say the military, despite how vital it is, is also a traditional hub of counterrevolution. They point to the history of military leaders overthrowing progressive regimes in support of oppression. The risks of this are obvious as a political officer might be more interested in enforcing Party loyalty and ideological purity than actually leading his troops. This is a small sacrifice to make however if our state is to remain safe from opponents both foreign….and domestic."
GRU_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
GRU_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe will focus on building more and greater bombers. Bombing from the air is even newer than the concept of flight, only really taking off during the tail end of the Weltkrieg. However colonial conflicts abroad have shown the effectiveness of bombers. Their ability to drop tons of high explosives on enemy positions with little fear of retaliation make them an excellent force mitigator. Not only that but the morale effect of an endless rain of bombs is undeniable. As such, we shall fill the sky with our metal birds and crater the ground with their firety rain of death!"
GRU_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
GRU_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The concept of fighter aircraft is not new to us. They proved their use quickly in the Great War and have been a foundation of every air force in the world. By denying our enemy control of the skies we won't have to worry about their bombers terrorizing our soldiers and we could even send our bombers out instead. Not only that but German companies like Focke-Wulf and Messerschmitt have been recognized as some of the best fighter producers in the world. To turn our backs on them would be idiocy."
GRU_carrier_focus:0 "Carrier Focus"
GRU_carrier_focus_desc:0 "It's a simple fact that planes can travel much further than meer shells. Early tests done in the 1920s and early 1930s have suggested that seaplanes, or these so called ‘aircraft carriers’ with traditionally land based planes could revolutionize warfare at sea! We have recognized this and as a revolutionary government its only proper we have a revolutionary Navy. We will focus our efforts on building up Carrier fleets and using them to crush our enemies at sea before they can even see us."
GRU_battleship_focus:0 "Battleship Focus"

GRU_panzertruppe:0 "Panzertruppe"
GRU_panzertruppe_desc:0 "As we rebuild our Army we have come to the conclusion that tanks and motorized vehicles are the future. Not only can they go faster than any man could ever hope to, a tank or truck only wants for fuel and parts. Not only that but they can even hold a whole squad or more of men and take them with them. Using their rapid movement and the tanks' hard hitting power, we can break through their lines and win through Bewegungskrieg or Maneuver Warfare."
GRU_panzergrenadiere:0 "Panzergrenadiere"
GRU_panzergrenadiere_desc:0 "Infantry have been the foundation of the army. Some say the new innovation of the tank should deprive them of this place of reverence. We shall relegate tanks to their true role as support for the true hammer of the Proletariat, the valiant infantry. Using vehicles they will achieve a sense of mobility unseen since Napoleon’s lighting campaigns through Italy and Germany. With adequate support these mechanized spearheads will be impossible to stop."

GRU_cruiser_focus:0 "Cruiser Focus"
GRU_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "With our surface fleet growing exponentially we will need sufficient surface support. While u-boats proved their merit in the Weltkrieg, to use them in the next war would play directly into the enemy's hands. Anti-submarine warfare technology has grown by leaps and bounds. Instead we will focus on building surface ships like cruisers and destroyers to both protect our bigger ships while striking down the subs of our enemies."

Its incessant planning and meticulous calculations have done our great nation wonders in the wars from the Franco-Prussian to the Weltkrieg. While the old General Staff is too reactionary and dissentious to be of much use, this has left us with a great opportunity. Doing away with those grey haired fossils will allow for younger minds with newer ideas to rise further through the ranks"

GRU_occupational_government_desc:0 "The German Empire is dead and rotting in the ground. The Kaiser has fled and his government has gone to ground. Now, we have been left with a new problem, the Kaiser’s people. They are people who lick boots for breakfast and piss shoe shine. To make them good Syndicalists is going to be an arduous task. The first step however is in some ways the hardest. We must give governance back to the Germans, under our watchful eye, to let them choose their future. One they might even learn to accept."
GRU_mass_conscription:0 "Overwhelming Numbers"
GRU_mass_conscription_desc:0 "After Russia our nation is the most populous in the world. This gives us a marked advantage over our enemies on the Continent.

GRU_oknvm:0 "OK-NVM"
GRU_oknvm_desc:0 "The Oberkommando Nationale Volksmarine will take over for the old Imperial Admiralty. The old Admiralty was fractious and divided and as such we had a rather lackluster performance at sea, worse than we should have been at the very least. To remedy this while the OK-NVM will itself be divided into several departments and such to better oversee the vastness of our navy, they will report to the Generalsstab-Marine, who will in turn consolidate everything into a report for a single man, the Chief of Naval Warfare, or CdF who will then make decisions. Some say this will be too much for one man to handle, but we know the power of a single man."

If our armies are to know victory we must make sure they won't have to spend half their time looking ot the skies as well as ahead of them. To that end the Luftwaffe has been ordered to focus on supporting our ground troops in their advance. This has been said to be done at the detriment to our Navy’s actions at sea but our Navy is powerful enough that it doesn't need to cower from airborne threats."

GRU_hydroelectric_power_desc:0 "To sustain our massive industrial power we need more energy, electricity. We have gained much of that from fossil fuels but much of it comes from imports. This leaves us vulnerable to the whims of other powers. To remedy this situation somewhat we shall develop our hydroelectric capacity. Germany has many rivers from large ones to the Rhine and the Elbe, to smaller ones like the Oder.

GRU_GOEBBELS_DESC:0 "Before his rise to power Goebbels worked as a journalist and occasional Film Theater and Theater critique in his hometown of Rheydt. He was relatively well known in his home region and within the bigger cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Mönchengladbach near his hometown.\nHis early contact with Marxism during his youth and tendencies to Nationalism influenced his political leanings and ideological thought a lot which he had to hide during the reign of the Kaiser or he might have faced a ban on his journalism work due to repressions against far left writers in the German Empire.\nWhile not being in line with traditional Syndicalist or Socialist values he can be seen a a mirror to the French Sorelians with his Syncretism between ideological concepts that can be found within the far left and the far right he has manifested himself his very own ideology which he calls „National-Marxism“. It still remains questionable if it is actually different to Sorelian National-Syndicalism or if it even is 'Marxist' at all."

rotermorgenmisc.1.d:0 "After the nationalization and merging of all media production and distribution into the UFA, Volksführer Goebbels ordered them to find new means for mass influence. An employee at UFA who was responsible for creating background sounds with his Elektrophon and recordings of sounds he would manipulate, came up with a new form of music, the 'Sythetische Musik'. At first deemed Un-German by his superior, its weird modern sounds did catch the ear of Volksführer Goebbels during a routine visit. The Volksführer was stunned by this new truly German form of music and its ability to let people 'vibe' on it while adding subliminal messages."

The FAUD, which has lost a lot of influence thanks to the legal formation of leftist parties in Germany, and the NMDVP, which is lead by Josef Goebbels and is not accepted by the other parties for its call for Ultranationalism, promotion of traditional values and call for a „National Rebirth“."

rotermorgen.80.d:0 "The SMEPD consisting of the SMEPD-S and SMEPD-M factions has finally split due to constant infighting among the Syndicalists and Marxists on important matters as the state and future of the economy.

rotermorgen.10.t:0 "The Occupation"
rotermorgen.10.d:0 "Now that we hold total control over Germany we must find a future way for it. The problem we now face is that while there have been underground organizations all over the German Empire, there has not been any official syndicalist or socialist one beside the FAUD, and we can't simply hand all power to a worker union that has strong factionalism inside.\nThe committee, consisting of the French, British and Italian delegations, has decided to call for the Germans to form unions parties for a future Congress of German Unions."

rotermorgen.30.t:0 "The FAUD Split"
rotermorgen.30.d:0 "The FAUD has recently faced some major problems, when Ernst Thälmann left with a significant portion of its more Centralist members to form the SUDA „Syndikalistsche Union Deutscher Arbeiter“.\nFollowing this, the remains of the FAUD have made it clear that they will now represent the only truly Syndicalist union, as they call Thälmann a Marxist, Bolshevik, and traitor to liberty for his centralization stance on the government and economy."

rotermorgen.40.a:0 "Lenin failed in Russia, Pieck will fail here."

rotermorgen.50.t:0 "The Hypnotic Charm of a Small Man"
rotermorgen.50.d:0 "While many already considered the formation of Pieck's MLEPD as problematic for a Syndicalist society, no one would have expected a party that could overshadow that.\n\nJosef Goebbels, a former supporter of marxism and furiously Nationalistic journalist from the Rhineland managed to organize a meeting of Nationalist hardliners in Pieck's MLEPD, Nationalists that had sympathies towards Marxist and Syndicalist economics, and the minority of „German Sorelians“."

That maniac from the Rhine, Josef Goebbels, did actually manage to sway people to his cause and organized his own party, the NMDVP, a „National-Marxist“ party as he calls it which is more or less a German version of French National-Syndicalism which one big difference, his ideology does not even call for ending capitalism instead prefering a partially nationalized social corporate economy a fact many already consider to be a betrayl of the revolution.\n\nHe even openly defies our power monopoly by forming his own militia called the „beefsteaks“ by many due to them using brown uniforms with red shirts."

Yet, the German Empire does nothing to alleviate their suffering. Too concerned with its own imperial confusion to help the average German. Black Monday for many Germans has finally pulled their heads out of the clouds, as they finally see that the Empire cares little for them or their families. Such resentment has done the unthinkable, as people who once detested the reds now are joining one of their many groups.

Which is why the radical wing of the SPD, the R.A.M., FAUD, NM-KV and SNF have agreed to join within a United Front to better coordinate their efforts. This astonishing turn of events shows the threat in which the Socialists pose to the German order. Whispers in even the highest halls of power are speaking of the possibility of open red revolt should the United Front continue to gain traction.

While the current product is still early stage and expensive to produce, it hasn’t stopped the upper echelons of the party leadership from installing this “visual radio” into their own homes. Currently, there are only two channels on the Volksfernseher, one for news and one for entertainment which mostly consists of live music performances in various UFA studios. Not to mention getting a decent signal for the Volksfernseher is difficult as there isn’t sufficient civilian telecommunications infrastructure to support it.

Being seen as foreign and responsible for the root of the suffering for the German worker since the middle ages, the Volskfuhrer and the party leadership have been harassing Germany’s Jewish population since their ascension to power. Recently, the regime has been ramping up efforts to tackle the question of the Jews within Germany. To complete this task, Goebbels has signed off on the creation of the Central Organization of Jewish Affairs, acting as a subdivision of the RR. Staffed by RR members with extensive knowledge on Judaism, with some even going as far as to speak Hebrew fluently, the division is expected by the regime to come up with plans to drive the Jewish population out of German lands or at least isolate them. Already, plans detailing agreements with the local governments within Madagascar and the Levant to accept Jewish emigrants along with the logistics for emigrating Jews to those lands are already starting to be drafted. Along with this come plans of concentrating urban Jewish populations into walled off ghettos within those urban centers, even with suspected coordinated harassment and attacks with the VR to give extra “encouragement” for the Jews to leave. Obvious human rights concerns have come up over these alleged plans with many governments accusing the NMDVP’s actions of being depraved and vile, with even some of Germany’s allies raising concerns in private. However, it is unlikely that these objections will change much if anything over the course Germany has decided to take with its Jewish population."

On an early Saturday, both Rudi and Liesel were given money to buy fresh fruit and bread from the market for their household, a task the two especially enjoyed. In the open market where flags of the new Germany flew, the shoppers and shopkeepers greeted each other with salutes and “Heil Goebbels” before completing their transaction and waving farewell by doing the same. Rudi and Liesel became accustomed to this, after all it seemed only natural to thank the man who brought them prosperity anyway. As they were returning home from the market, something caught Rudi’s eye. A poster on a wall, on depicting three rats holding individual bayonets at Germany, exclaiming that “The Dangers to Germany Shall Threaten Us Until Destroyed!”. The first rat wore a beret and a mustache, the second a Pickelhaube with big red lips, and the third had curly hair and an elongated nose. Rudi knew immediately what they were; the deceitful French, the treacherous Kaiser in Africa, and the scheming Jew. His blood shot up and his face began to run red with anger. He stood there wishing the destruction of the enemies jealous of the new Germany and her prosperity. As Liesel called for him to continue, Rudi knew immediately what he wanted to be in the future.

Although the exact specifics of the Anarcho-Syndicalist curriculum may differ based on the area of Germany, there is a general agreement that children will be educated on the ideas of their society. The main tenants include emphasis on equity and cooperation among all peers, the encouragement of progressive ideals and experimentation, teaching students the inherent wrongs of the reactionary, capitalistic, and imperialistic Germany’s of yore, and the inner workings of the Anarcho-Syndicalist system and the ideals that power it. Some families claim that the new curriculum is purely ideological and doesn’t prepare the next generation for actual work. In some towns, there are notable absences of subjects such as calculus and physics while subjects revolving around socialist political theory and the arts get more precedence in schooling. FAUD has addressed these concerns by emphasizing how the Anarcho-Syndicalist future must be secured within education first before reactionaries poison the next generation."

rotermorgenmisc.22.d:0 "The long running conservatism within Germany that has persisted up until the deposing of the Kaiser has offered some of the harshest punishments towards the homosexuals of Germany. Homosexual activity was met with harsh prison sentences and hard labor, and even in some cases resulted in some of them being sent to mental institutions for electroshock therapy and, in the cases of high-profile homosexuals, experimental lobotomy treatments. FAUD has viewed the treatment of gays and lesbians in this manner as incredibly barbaric and backward, which is why it came as little surprise to any when they decriminalized homosexuality and enacted legal protections towards them. Under the new laws, homosexuals will be granted equal opportunities in all levels of government, employment, and military service with any institutional discrimination towards or hate crimes towards them being met with legal punishment. The most controversial aspect of these new laws is the protections of the very small transsexual community in Germany, which even some members of FAUD think is going a bit too far as it might bolden the already inflamed reactionary resistance to these new laws. However, despite the challenges towards these new laws, many members of FAUD and the progressives of Germany that this is a step in the right direction."

When one looks to the revolutions of France, England, and Italy, you never saw formal units end the rule of reactionaries. Rather, it was the will and strength of the masses who were able to drive out the capitalists and tyrants and bring about the Revolution. FAUD understands this principle fully, which is why they have decided unanimously during a joint session of their trade unions to formally declare the red militias as the military vanguard of the Revolution. This declaration firmly places the militias as the main military force of Germany and to be the institution most trusted with maintaining and upholding the revolution behind the unions and councils themselves. While some may raise concerns over a group of informal weekend warriors being the backbone of maintaining order and defending Germany, the members of FAUD and quite a few Germans are ecstatic over this development as the defenders of the Revolution finally get the rightful importance and recognition they deserve."

Not even mentioning those of the colonies who had came to the mainland for the purpose of work, whether they be black, South East Asian, or Chinese. To keep these minority groups down any longer would be a disgrace to German history and its people, which is why during a recent session of FAUD unions it was agreed on that more action should be taken to ensure that these groups are treated equally. Aside from the anti-discrimination laws against them, unions and communes have instituted employment quotas for minority groups every year to ensure that they get better chances of employment. Failure to hit the quotas might result in potential fines and punishments towards the unions and communes that do so. This is perhaps the most controversial action taken by FAUD so far, as it was the first FAUD vote to receive a decent amount of union opposition to. Despite the radical nature of these reforms, history will perhaps show that they were necessary in achieving equality and progress for all of Germany’s inhabitants."

Named the Geheime Staatspolizei, or Gestapo for short, this new centralized police agency will answer only directly to the will of the People’s Parliament and has carte blanche to run operations as they see fit for the sake of Germany and the Revolution. The parliament voted for militia leader and longtime loyalist Ernst Wollweber to be the Gestapo’s first head. Since the creation of the Gestapo, there are already various confirmed disappearance of some German citizens and some of the more vocal members of the opposition have gone strangely silent if they weren’t apart of the disappeared already.

The methods tend to differ based on who carries it out; the Gestapo prefers a method called “Sardine Packing where reactionaries lay down in a deep ditch only to be shot while the next row lays on top of their corpses to repeat the process, while some of the red militias prefer using mounted machine guns to mow down lined up crowds before pilling their corpses to be doused with gasoline and set on fire. There are even rumors going around that one militia, Rotkämpferbund Radek, has preformed various cruel acts on those meant to be executed, with some claims saying that some are hunted like animals or dragged by vehicles, not even mentioning the stories of rape and use of reactionaries as targets for shooting practice.

Despite whatever challenges they may have put up, Pieck’s faction has been weakened to a point where they can be removed from the picture as a whole. Which is why the People’s Parliament issued arrest warrants for Pieck and the upper echelons of his clique so that they could be brought to public trial. International observers remarked that the trials were conducted with an usual degree of fairness, as the defendants were given proper lawyers to defend them along with time to make their case. However, it did not change the fact that the presiding jury had been entirely comprised of SMEPD bureaucrats or low ranking militia members, or the fact that some of the evidence and witness testimonies were either partially or fully fabricated to match some of the charges against them. In the end, Pieck along with his inner circle and lieutenants were found guilty of a variety of charges, with all of them having their party membership, along with any awards and titles, revoked and being prohibited of holding a position of power or political office again. The courts even went as far as the place Pieck and some others on indefinite house arrest.

It will also house most ministries and the offices as well as the apartment of the Volksführer himself. It has been completely designed by Speer and resembles somewhat an oversized Reichstag in Speers architectural design with some having spoken out concern about the size of its dome as the condensing air could eventually lead to clouds inside of it.\n\nOn top of the 290 meters high Volkshalle will stand a mighty eagle 20 meters tall with a meeting room in the egales head and it’s wings serving as viewing platform from which all of Germania can be seen."

Featuring several massive landmarks like the Triumph Arc and the Volkshalle Germania is now dragging in thousands of tourists from all over the world to it’s massive airport and the city is slowly but exponentially coming to true life as many party officials, decorated heroes and their families have been given apartments in Germania for free and the rents are as low as possible on purpose to encourage Germanics from all over the German reigned lands to move to Germania, to live in the jewel of Europe and become part of the future."

The full plan would include the formation of the Wirtschaftskommission der Industriellen or W.D.I., a committee of the most influential industrials… or rather those in the room at this moment. It would also include the formal dissolution of the DLP and also the dissolution of the Reichstag installing the W.D.I. as an emergency legislative body and defacto setting up a dictatorship by group and his gang.\nBut not all at the meeting were confident about it yet and called for less drastic measurements to ensure their through the DLP."
