###Focus
hnn_kmtuni_helong:0 "He Long's Victory"
hnn_kmtuni_helong_desc:0 "Who could have predicted the victory of He Long over all other contenders to the claim of China? Yet it has happened. With our rule consolidated, it is now time to deal with the less visible details of our government lest they lead to our downfall."
hnnunilong_arm:0 "A New Army"
hnnunilong_arm_desc:0 "Whether it be He Long's origin as an outlaw who managed to fight against the Qing or the fighting that the National Revolutionary Army has faced during the march towards unification, the army that helped the people was always the weaker force. However, with reunification complete, the modernization of the army can now take place so that the National Revolution can be defended."
hnnunilong_visit:0 "Seeking International Cooperation"
hnnunilong_visit_desc:0 "As China has just climbed out of warlordism, it does not have much of anything in terms of technology. We must be willing to work with anyone willing to work with us if we wish to free China from its backwardness. We cannot let pride prevent us from learning as such an action was exactly what first ended the Qing dynasty. He Long is the perfect man for this job. Though he may not be refined like most Chinese, his charisma during his visits to other states has allowed many beneficial negotiations to continue."
hnnunilong_research:0 "Eliminating Rural Illiteracy"
hnnunilong_research_desc:0 "Like many other Chinese, He Long did not have a formal education. Being born into a poor rural family, they simply could not afford to send him to school. This is wasted potential at its most obvious. If our China is to ever claim it is a modern country, it would be lying as long millions of rural youth cannot read. We will do all we can to help these people learn by doing things like working with barefoot teachers."
hnnunilong_reform:0 "Commence the National Land Reform"
hnnunilong_reform_desc:0 "We will reform the ownership of the land to bring China forwards from fuedalism into the present age. Only once that is completed can China truly become a major force in the world."
hnnunilong_commie:0 "The Victory of Rebellion"
hnnunilong_commie_desc:0 "With just two kitchen knives, Comrade He Long started an uprising against the Qing, and now the Qing have been defeated and the army he leads acts as the sword of the masses of China. The seemingly hopeless odds of struggle have still led to victory."
hnnunili:0 "The Syndicalist Triumph"
hnnunili_desc:0 "From being the junior partner of the United Front, Li Lisan's syndicalist faction now controls the government of China. With national reconstruction practically complete, the syndicalists are now capable of bringing syndicalism to the masses."
hnnunili_arm:0 "Nurture the Revolutionary Future"
hnnunili_arm_desc:0 "As the late Eternal Premier instructed us, the future belongs to the youth and the strength of the revolution depends on our care and instruction of China's next generation. Let us create a socialist youth corps, dedicated to the idea of loyalty to the Chinese nation and to the Chairman so that we may prepare the next generation to maintain the revolution."
hnnunili_french_learn: "Emulate the French Education Model"
hnnunili_french_learn_desc: "We have learned a lot from our dear brothers and sisters of the revolutionary cause in France, including how they have handled the concepts of public education, of research universities, and of workers' education. It is fitting that in a country struggling with literacy, that we adopt educational institutions akin to those in Europe for modernisation."
hnnunili_united: "Working With Friends Abound"
hnnunili_united_desc: "In high school, he befriended Mao Zedong. He fought under Cheng Qian. He was in France when the revolution was happening. These connections with the many progressive forces of the world means Li Lisan has many friends that are willing to work with him now that he is at the helm of China. It is now obvious to all that Liu Shaoqi's faction was incorrect as without these friends China would not be united under syndicalism right now."
hnnunili_unonize: "Unionizing the Urban Workers"
hnnunili_unonize_desc: "With China and especially Hunan lacking an urbanized workforce, the support base for syndicalism has always been lacking when compared to the developed countries of the west. However, now that we have reunified China, we can begin unionizing the workers in more urbanized areas to secure support."
hnnunili_interior: "Reaching towards the Peasants"
hnnunili_interior_desc: "The peasants that make up the majority of the population of China need to support us if our state is to succeed. Policies that target and improve their lives like rural education will satisfy them while also leading the way towards urbanization."
hnnunili_class_unity: "For the Unity of All Classes"
hnnunili_class_unity_desc: "With our outreach towards the World Society, we have begun working with them and applying many of their proudhonist ideals to our practice. As efforts to begin land reform merely cause needless strife by dividing people into two sides, we will need to change these programs to stress cooperation between the people for a better future. In this way, these inefficient ideas of strugge will end." 
hnnunili_land_reform: "Developing Land Reform"
hnnunili_land_reform_desc: "By strengthening our relationship with the radical wing of the CSP, we now have the influence needed to push through a comprehensive land reform program. This program will bring about the end of the feudal practice of landlording in China to bring it into the modern age."
hnnunili_orthodox: "Welcoming Back the Central Branch of the CSP"
hnnunili_orthodox_desc: "Though Li Lisan's branch of the CSP based in Hunan may have come out victorious, he has been a leader of the orthodox faction of the CSP along with Chen Duxiu. Along with welcoming them back, the policies of the orthodox faction will be implemented."
hnnunili_prodhon: "Reconcile the World Society"
hnnunili_prodhon_desc: "The World Society is a group of anarchist idealists still believing in the fantasy of class reconciliation and harboring Proudhonist ideals, led by intellectuals and revolutionaries like Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Renjie, and Cai Yuanpei. For a long time they opposed us, aligned with the rightist of the Kuomintang, but now that the CSP is the dominant organization in China, they seem to have adopted a more conciliatory attitude. Although we will never fully adopt their ideals, we will take this opportunity to put an end to the open conflict between our two organizations and benefit from their influence in the Kuomintang."
hnnunili_radicals: "Working with the Radicals"
hnnunili_radicals_desc: "We will work with the young radical factions of the CSP that have grown due to the exile of the Kuomintang to the European revolutionary countries. The ultimate goal of our unity with the Kuomintang is and has always been the victory of the syndicalist revolution, and with dedicated cadre that goal is closer than ever."
hnnunili_lisan_line: "Follow the Li Lisan Line!"
hnnunili_lisan_line_desc: "Cadre Li Lisan is one of the most loyal and productive members inside the CSP. Even when the CSP was in its infancy, Li Lisan put his all into his party work to organize the people. Every good syndicalist should strive to have as much dedication to learning and working while still remaining humble and loyal to the working class."
hnnunimao: "Mao's Kuomintang Victorious"
hnnunimao_desc: "What a journey it has been for the Hunanese branch of the Kuomintang. From losing the elections to the Xinmin Society to working with them to now uniting China. Now with basic reconstruction complete, the future looks bright."
hnnunimao_rehab: "Shaking Hands with the Former Central Committee"
hnnunimao_rehab_desc: "The Central Committee and the Hunanese branch of the Kuomintang have not had the most warm relations. With Cheng Qian already having an independent streak, Mao's ascension to the leadership of the branch only soured relations further. Yet with the unification of China under the Hunanese branch of the Kuomintang, the only real option the former Central Committee has is to shake the outstretched hand."
hnnunimao_arm: "Revolutionary Land Reform"
hnnunimao_arm_desc: "With the help of the Kuomintang, the Party is to help organise rural associations and cooperatives among the peasantry in order to foster the roots for a good and nurtured democracy. These cooperatives will help them realise the goals of minquan and minsheng with the help of the Party's leadership to help strengthen their revolutionary consciousness while also providing for their own needs from the risk of famines. This action on the part of the peasantry against their former oppressors is the greatest instructor of class struggle."
hnnunimao_demo: "Xinmin Society Literature"
hnnunimao_demo_desc: "It is clear the new Kuomintang has been influenced by the ideology of the Xinmin Society. President Mao's writings on the issues that plague China today now reach the hearts and minds of millions of Chinese. In fact, even organizations outside of China have read President Mao's writings in order to grow their knowledge on how to enact the social revolution in their homelands. Bringing hope to the hearts of the downtrodden the world over, President Mao's writings shine like the sun."
hnnunimao_new_demo: "A True People's Democracy"
hnnunimao_new_demo_desc: "As Dr. Sun wrote, the four basic democratic rights: the rights to election, the rights to initiative, the rights to referendum, and the rights to recall are guaranteed irrespective of sex, creed, property or education. So too must the four revolutionary classes of China: the peasantry, the proletariat, the petite bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie act as the class basis of the National Revolution and make up the Party. As the classes that constitute the majority of the population now take control of the country and its governance, China has finally arrived at democracy."
hnnunimao_warlords: "Even the Biggest Traitor can be Reformed"
hnnunimao_warlords_desc: "There have been many enemies that stood in the way of unification. Now that we are in control of China, the question is what to do with them. They could just be executed but what use would that be? By rehabilitating those who have reformed, we gain another loyal citizen who has learnt the justness of the Party. The National Revolution was for the Chinese people, even the warlords who fought us."
hnnunimao_women: "The Liberation of the Chinese Woman"
hnnunimao_women_desc: "The national revolution is not just the struggle of the Chinese people against the imperialists but it is also a social revolution; a revolution to break centuries of backwardness and to bring forth a new era. As such, we will encourage our country's women to take part in the revolution and to fight for a new world for themselves."
hnnunimao_learn: "Starting Up the Nuclear Program"
hnnunimao_learn_desc: "The atom bomb is a dangerous weapon in the hands of the imperialists. Though it may not be able to win wars, it is naturally used by the imperialists to scare and coerce other countries into following their demands. If we don't want to be bullied by those imperialists, then we should have nuclear weapons by all means."
hnnunimao_supress: "Movement to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries"
hnnunimao_supress_desc: "The rehabilitation programs were done despite the fact that we knew they'd be unpopular. When one controls the destiny of the man who killed one's friends and family, one's first instinct is to do to that man as was done to one. Yet such an instinct should not be used to decide we treat our fellow man. While we had expected some response, the protests by the people demanding punishment shows the success of the National and Democratic Revolution in growing the political consciousness of the people. We will listen to the people and scrutinize the hiring process of guards so they do not have connections with the prisoners. Meanwhile, we will spend more resources on capturing warlords and bandits that are still wreaking havoc."
hnnunimao_soc: "In Pursuit of the People's Welfare"
hnnunimao_soc_desc: "China is a poor country. The only option that will allow for the people's livelihood to be secure is socialism. The bourgeoisie and feudal classes have shown themselves to be compradors who would sell out their country for the crumbs that fall off the table of the imperialists. Thus, only the peasants and proletarians can fufill the national revolution and bring prosperity to China."
hnnunili_mao_plum_flower: "Plum Blossoms Bloomed into Perfection"
hnnunili_mao_plum_flower_desc: "Just as the plum blossom's flowers grow most vibrantly under the harshest conditions, so too have the Chinese people shown their ability to overcome even the greatest obstacles. With President Mao at the helm, Dr. Sun's dream has come into fruition. Under the leadership of the Kuomintang, the peasants and workers have been organised so that they are able to stand strong and tall against imperialism and against domestic bullies. The Party shall lead the peasants and workers towards a glorious Red China and seek to show the world - that the East is now the bulwark of socialism."
hnnuniqian: "Cheng's Kuomintang Victorious"
hnnuniqian_desc: "The Hunanese branch of the Kuomintang have now achieved their victory of uniting China. With basic reconstruction now complete, Cheng Qian can now build the republican dream of the Kuomintang."
hnnuniqian_lkmt: "Shaking Hands with the Left"
hnnuniqian_lkmt_desc: "Cheng has always had some sympathies with the left of the Kuomintang though some of the more radical syndicalists may not have left a good impression. With the Hunanese branch holding the keys to power, the central committee will be welcomed back to contribute to the development of China with their policies like land reform."
hnnuniqian_rkmt: "Working with the Right"
hnnuniqian_rkmt_desc: "The right of the Kuomintang has weakened since the failure of the Northern Expedition. However, with Cheng in power, he has welcomed back many of the more right-aligned Kuomintang members like Sun Yat-Sen's son Sun Fo to work together on developing China."
hnnuniqian_north: "Reintegration and Reconciliation"
hnnuniqian_north_desc: "The warlord era has left a visible mark on the Chinese people. With victory achieved, the Kuomintang is practically the only large organized political force that can bring governance to the people. The lack of trained cadres from areas that were never penetrated by the Kuomintang, means we will have to transfer many officials from our southern Hunan to northern China if we want to properly control these areas."
hnnuniqian_research: "Learning for China"
hnnuniqian_research_desc: "In the revolutionary times of the late Qing dynasty, Cheng gave up his civil career for a military career as that was what would benefit China the most at the time. With our revolution successful, what will benefit China the most now is education so that the country can develop and modernize. The patriotic youth should focus on learning so that China can step into the future."
hnnuniqian_mao: "Help from the Xinmin Society in Land Reform"
hnnuniqian_mao_desc: "As we work to develop China by fixing the feudal order that dominates China, we have begun to work with the Xinmin Society to grow grassroots support for the Kuomintang amongst the peasantry. This relationship has only benefited from the fact that the leader of the Xinmin Society, Mao Zedong, once served under Cheng in the first days of the Republic. Despite their differing political views, the two have formed quite a friendship."
hnnuniqian_republicanism: "No Chance for Monarchs"
hnnuniqian_republicanism_desc: "As a dedicated republican who fought to overthrow the Qing for the first time, Cheng knows that the only way for China to develop is to rid itself of the dead disease of monarchism. With the victory of the republic, it is time to put the Qing in the past and make sure it cannot revive once more."
hnnuniqian_state_capital: "City After City Rises"
hnnuniqian_state_capital_desc: "On our path to develop China, we will need foreign investment, which we will get by opening up some of our coastal cities and making them enticing for investment. This influx of capital will be instrumental in building a modern China as buildings and factories are constructed. However, we must be careful to prevent foreign investment from corrupting our officials while also making sure these investments benefit the chinese people."
hnnuniqian_mil: "Artillery Modernization"
hnnuniqian_mil_desc: "A modern army is an essential goal if China to to be secure from foreign dominance. As a military officer himself, Cheng is used to the battlefield and has many ideas about how to reform the military. Due to him learning about becoming an artillery lieutenant when he studied in Japan, such plans have naturally involved increasing the use of artillery in army doctrine."
hnnuniqian_sun: "A Comrade Since 1905"
hnnuniqian_sun_desc: "As a comrade of Sun Yat-Sen in the Tongmenghui who fought to bring down the Qing and usher in a new republic, Cheng has the credentials of a Kuomintang member who has been consistently loyal to Dr. Sun's dream. With him leading the new republic under the Kuomintang, the future looks bright for the dream of the eternal primier."
hnnunijian: "The Right Kuomintang Victorious"
hnnunijian_desc: "Despite the fact that some of the party once fled overseas to syndicalist controlled countries, many true patriots of Sun Yat-sen and China did not abandon the struggle and instead fought to liberate China. Now with the right wing of the Kuomintang victorious, the world will be able to see the true vision of Sun Yat-sen rather then the distortions of the syndicalists."
hnnunijian_again_purge: "Vigilance against Syndicalist Infiltration"
hnnunijian_again_purge_desc: "While we may have dealt with the syndicalist organizations who threatened our stability in Hunan, we now control much more than just Hunan. In these regions, syndicalism has been allowed to thrive because of incompetent local administration and the chaos of the unification campaign. With us now being in control, we can show the people the truth and destroy these syndicalists for the good of China."
hnnunijian_miltary: "Honor the Heros"
hnnunijian_miltary_desc: "It was only through the work of the dedicated armed forces who gave up their lives in the fight to united China that we now stand here today. We shall celebrate these brave heroes so that their sacrifices for this China will never be in vain."
hnnunijian_personal: "Peacefully Subduing the Warlords"
hnnunijian_personal_desc: "In the times since the first end of the Qing, there have been armed warlords abound who seek only personal wealth. These independent warlords have only weakened China. In order to end such chaos, we will use the personal relationships that have been gained through the years to convince them to peacefully bend the knee and work with the national government."
hnnunijian_anti_soc: "Ending the Problem at the Root"
hnnunijian_anti_soc_desc: "The syndicalist threat, like a poison that spreads through the body, will grow if not taken care of properly. In that vein, if we only focus on the symptoms that have grown powerful enough to oppose us, new threats will endlessly grow to threaten us again and again. Thus, the truth about the syndicalist cancer must be spread to the people, and embedded within their minds, about how their honeyed words of "women's equality" and "class struggle" are merely a facade to weaken the the Chinese nation with foreign designs like the sharing of wives and the end of personal friendship. In this way, the illness of syndicalism will never again take root in our people."
hnnunijian_foreign_capital: "Utilizing Foreign Capital"
hnnunijian_foreign_capital_desc: "It is the foreign concessions that hold the capital that will be necessary to modernize China. We will use this investment in order to develop our industries and lands. We will also need to be careful about the influence this western investment will have on our country lest we fall to the foreign regimes."
hnnunijian_land: "Ties with the Landowners"
hnnunijian_land_desc: "By working with the landowners that hold the majority of the wealth of China, we can balance their interests against the interests of foreign capital allowing our government to remain a nationalist one dedicated not to foreign wealth but to the Chinese people."
hnnunijian_research_foreign: "New Research Advancements"
hnnunijian_research_foreign_desc: "With the minds of the students free from the grasp of syndicalism and the influx of investment, our universities have grown with learned and patriotic youth dedicated to growing the knowledge of the motherland. This is the key to our modernization."
hnnunijian_patronage: "Greasing the Palms"
hnnunijian_patronage_desc: "By utilizing the ultimate desire of the warlords, our government shall be able to complete its function smoothly and effectively."
hnnunijian_die: "Retirement of the Generalissimo" #IDK about the ranks that would be given to he jian
hnnunijian_die_desc: "Recently, our leader He Jian has become aware of his morality as his condition has worsened. With this in mind, he has decided to retire. Now it is  time for elections to decide who will be the next president of the Republic of China."



 KMT_white_sun: "White Sun over China"
 KMT_white_sun_desc: "Though the process has been arduous, we have finally consolidated our rule across the nation and can begin the official formation of a new republic under the White Sun. We must now lay the groundwork for the next stage in our revolution, integrating all provinces in China to the organs of our government."

 KMT_tridemism: "Sanmin Doctrine"
 KMT_tridemism_desc: "The Three Principles of the People, or Sanmin Doctrine, is the basis of Sun Yat-sen's political philosophy and the Kuomintang. The Principles guide our government in its policies and decisions, and their importance must be understood by the people in the coming fight."

 KMT_organic_law: "Organic Law of the Republic"
 KMT_organic_law_desc: "While Political Tutelage continues and the final Constitution is drafted, the Organic Law of the National Government has been promulgated. This act reorganised the National Government into five branches, or Yuan, and reinforced the Kuomintang's exercise of sovereign power for the duration of Political Tutelage."

 KMT_minzu_focus: "Minzu"
 KMT_minzu_focus_desc: "Minzu, or Nationalism, is one of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and revolves around a common livelihood, language, religion, customs, and most importantly, a shared bloodline. National unity is paramount to our success, and shall allow China to succeed against other nations in the struggle for supremacy."

 KMT_minquan_focus: "Minquan"
 KMT_minquan_focus_desc: "Minquan, or Democracy, is the second of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Creating democratic institutions and preparing the Chinese people for them is one of the most important objectives of the National Revolution and will, in the long-run, prove that the Party is the best choice for China."

 KMT_legislature: "Legislative Yuan"
 KMT_legislature_desc: "While China is not anywhere ready for full elections, the Nationalist Government needs to begin forming the institutions that democracy will, one day, make its will known through. The Legislative Yuan, staffed by KMT representatives from both controlled and contested territories, will take over legislative responsibilities from the Central Committee."

 KMT_land_reform: "Nationalist Land Reform"
 KMT_land_reform_desc: "Peasants form the absolute majority of the Chinese population yet few of them own the land they work, killing any chance of socio-economic advancement. Land reform is a necessity to improve their livelihoods and reduce social tensions. Until the peasants of China own the land instead of leasing it from corrupt landlords, they will never be free."

 KMT_rent_control: "Land Value Tax"
 KMT_rent_control_desc: "Sun Yat-sen pushed for a Land Value Tax to be adopted in order to improve the country's finances, help push for land reform, and create a fairer taxation and economic system. We must implement his vision to help modernise the country and improve the economy."

 KMT_minsheng: "Minsheng"
 KMT_minsheng_desc: "Minsheng, commonly translated as 'The People's Welfare', is the last of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Following the implementation of a land value tax, social programmes will be created and expanded in order to help peasants and workers improve their quality of life by subsidising food consumption, clothing and housing costs."

 KMT_revive_china: "Revive China Programme"
 KMT_revive_china_desc: "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast programme of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West and alleviate the damaged economy."

 KMT_national_mausoleum: "Build the National Mausoleum"
 KMT_national_mausoleum_desc: "It is long past due to honour those who have fallen in service of Chinese Democracy. A national mausoleum will be constructed outside of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to house the remains of Sun Yat-Sen and other prominent revolutionaries."

 KMT_civil_service: "Expand the Civil Service"
 KMT_civil_service_desc: "To endure in the long run, the Nationalist Government must be more than a warlord clique or a party-state. A civil service that is independent of both the Kuomintang party apparatus and the army must begin formation."

 KMT_academia_sinica: "Academica Sinica"
 KMT_academia_sinica_desc: "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academica Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."

 KMT_national_reconstruction_commission: "National Reconstruction Commission"
 KMT_national_reconstruction_commission_desc: "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide programme of capital investments and standardisations. This programme will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population centres."

 KMT_bopomofo: "Bo, Po, Mo, Fo..."
 KMT_bopomofo_desc: "The current methods for romanising Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardise the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."

 KMT_triumphant_revolution: "Triumphant Revolution"
 KMT_triumphant_revolution_desc: "China has finally been reunited under the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth of the Kuomintang. While there is still a long way to go before we recover from the Century of Humiliation, we have fulfilled the dream of the late Dr. Sun."

 KMT_renovate_whampoa: "Expand the Whampoa Military Academy"
 KMT_renovate_whampoa_desc: "The Kuomintang Military Academy was first founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Whampoa near Guangzhou and created a cadre of politically-conscious officers from those who trained there. While simply restoring it was sufficient previously, the transformation of the NRA into a truly national army requires Whampoa to be expanded in order to fill the need for politically reliable and capable officers."

 KMT_central_military_academy: "Establish the Central Military Academy"
 KMT_central_military_academy_desc: "With the revolution's hold over China secure, there is no longer any need for the Whampoa Military Academy to remain in Guangzhou. The distinguished military school will be moved to our national capital to create a centralised military academy. This will help our central command structure and encourage recruits from all across the country to learn from the best officers China has to offer."

 KMT_standardised_arsenals: "Standardise Arsenals"
 KMT_standardised_arsenals_desc: "For several decades, the arsenals of China have been under the control of different and largely independent provincial and national governments. Now that a number of those arsenals are under our control, the logistical issues stemming from different arsenals producing different arms in different calibre for a single army are substantial and should be rectified as soon as possible."

 KMT_small_arms_development: "Small Arms Development"
 KMT_small_arms_development_desc: "Despite attempts by the numerous national and provincial governments to upgrade, the most widespread rifle in service remains the venerable, yet severely obsolete, Model 88. Making the standardisation on a new, modern rifle a reality rather than a project on paper is a top priority in order to improve our lacklustre military capabilities compared to other modern militaries."

 KMT_artillery_modernisation: "Artillery Modernisation"
 KMT_artillery_modernisation_desc: "Artillery is the king of the battlefield and modern pieces were a luxury in the warlord era. With the capabilities of a united China, we can modernise our guns and bring our firepower closer to the global standard."

 KMT_tank_arsenal: "Armoured Warfare"
 KMT_tank_arsenal_desc: "The development of armoured warfare has certainly been noticed in China, but to develop and use them here was but a pipe dream. Now that we are united and stronger than ever, now is the time to delve into these advanced technologies as an important stepping stone in China's modernisation."

 KMT_new_model_army: "New Model Army"
 KMT_new_model_army_desc: "A professional volunteer army will be the future of the Chinese army: a smaller army devoted to the Three Principles of the People and the National Revolution, focusing on quality over quantity. This will create a greater Esprit de Corps and discipline, creating better soldiers that can perform difficult tasks and follow difficult orders."

 KMT_professionalisation: "Instil Army Discipline"
 KMT_professionalisation_desc: "The new Chinese army will be a professional one, focusing on military training full-time, encouraging high levels of discipline and skill. The example of the Iron Army will become a model for modern professional armies comparable to any Western power."

 KMT_peoples_army: "The People's Army"
 KMT_peoples_army_desc: "The Chinese Army should take advantage of its manpower and size to fight wars. It should be a People's Army: One that represents the people and protects it. A pillar of national unification, not one of oppression or repression."

 KMT_conscription: "Unity Through Service"
 KMT_conscription_desc: "Widespread military service brings people from many regions together, giving them shared experiences and helping them see one another as brethren; concrete and true examples of brotherhood instead of vague concepts of nationhood. National unity will be strengthened by it."

 KMT_NRA: "The NRA Revitalised"
 KMT_NRA_desc: "Despite the NRA's problems after the unification, we have succeeded in our reforms to modernise and equip the NRA for future conflicts. Every day, we receive new and eager recruits ready to be taught by battle-hardened veterans of the NRA. As the true army of the Chinese Republic, our armed forces shall be a testament to the success of Chinese modernisation for generations to come. Long live the National Revolutionary Army, long live the Chinese Kuomintang!"

 KMT_aviation_school: "Formalise Aviation Schools"
 KMT_aviation_school_desc: "While there are indeed schools for pilots in China, they are few and relatively disorganised. Formalising these schools and creating a proper curriculum for pilots and maintenance crews will help create a proper air force for China."

 KMT_new_aircraft_factories: "New Aircraft Factories"
 KMT_new_aircraft_factories_desc: "The South of the country has seen a number of small aircraft workshops created in the last decade or two, but remained fairly small, only able to repair what few planes there were. Creating proper factories is another step towards developing a fledging aeronautics industry, a staple of the modern era."

 KMT_native_fighter_design: "Domestic Fighter Design"
 KMT_native_fighter_design_desc: "There have been a number of attempts at creating a Chinese aircraft, mostly based on foreign designs. With the help of foreign experts and an increasing pool of local technicians, we are now more than ever able to develop our own designs in the hopes of creating a modern air force to defend our skies."

 KMT_naval_bomber: "Naval Bomber Project"
 KMT_naval_bomber_desc: "While ignored at first, naval bombers armed with torpedoes and armour-piercing bombs are quickly becoming a serious threat to even the largest warships currently at sea. This technology might be exactly what China needs: A cost-effective way of destroying a vastly-larger enemy fleet threatening our coastline."

 KMT_medium_bomber: "Tactical Bomber Fleet"
 KMT_medium_bomber_desc: "Medium tactical bombers offer versatility to an air force with the ability to accomplish different types of mission. Of course, designing such a large plane has been unheard of until now and will certainly be a challenge."

 KMT_light_bomber: "Army Air Support"
 KMT_light_bomber_desc: "Light bombers as some kind of flying artillery is the best way an air force can support land operations. It is only logical that we focus on these close-air-support crafts as we forge a modern air force."

 KMT_expand_dockyard: "Expand Republican Dockyards"
 KMT_expand_dockyard_desc: "With the completion of the national unification and the fulfilment of Dr. Sun's vision, we must now take steps to transform our once fledgling provincial naval forces into the new national navy. Let us revive the Republic of China Navy under the flag of the White Sun and encourage the construction of dockyards across the coast of China to meet our growing need for ships."

 KMT_incorporate_beiyang_fleet: "Incorporate the Beiyang Fleet"
 KMT_incorporate_beiyang_fleet_desc: "As a result of the unification wars, some of China's best admirals and naval officers now find themselves out of work since the National Unification. We shall offer them full government amnesty so that these naval officers can train and lead the next generation of Chinese sailors on the high seas as part of China's new revolutionary navy."

 KMT_destroyers: "Modern Destroyer Flotilla"
 KMT_destroyers_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of any modern navy, especially one as fledging as China's. They will protect our coasts, shipping lanes and larger warships from submarines and small attack crafts."

 KMT_submarines: "Develop Submarines"
 KMT_submarines_desc: "Submarines are proving to be indispensable in modern naval warfare. For a navy as limited as ours, they may prove to be a life saver, allowing us to attack far stronger enemies by raiding their shipping lanes and harassing their larger fleets."

 KMT_cruisers: "Cruisers for our Fleet"
 KMT_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are important for scouting and screening and, realistically speaking, may be the largest warships we are capable of building at this time."

 KMT_coastal_defence: "Focus on Coastal Defence"
 KMT_coastal_defence_desc: "It would be insane to start planning for a large fleet capable of rivalling the naval Great Powers. As such, we must focus on a more flexible navy capable to protecting our long coast and interests in the Pacific."

 KMT_grand_fleet: "A Grand Fleet"
 KMT_grand_fleet_desc: "If China is to be considered a Great Power as it rightfully should be, a navy is indispensable. While it will certainly be a very long-term plan, our great navy must start somewhere and it must start now."
